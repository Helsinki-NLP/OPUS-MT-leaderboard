Members of the Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility of "betting as heroes"
The members of the part-session have been concerned about the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — a member of the Welsh Parliament).
Its purpose is to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Velsa Parliament).
The AM in all political spheres is concerned that it can make them an object of source.
One of the Leiborist parties AM explained that their group is worried about "the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Velssa: "twp" means "justice", but "pwp" means "kay".
The parties pointed out that none of the group "was satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Welsh Conservative Party recognises that his group is ready to consider a change of name, but adds that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "earm".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the English word "w" is spoken in the same way as the Jorchiera dialect "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing to change the name of the draft legislation, informed: "The final decision on what term will be used to mark the members of the Assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the Assembly."
The 2017 Act of Government of Wales granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the proposal for a public consultation and received broad support for the change in the title of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of AM, the Commission made the promotion of the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
The AM is clearly proposing alternative options, but the fight against the agreement may give rise to major pain to the Assembly's strengths Elina Jones (Elin Jones), who will be expected to submit a draft legislative amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft legislation on amendments will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including legislation on the structure of the AM Disability and Committees System.
The AM final vote on what they will say will take place when the legislative acts have been discussed.
The Macedonians shall vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the State
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their national name will be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's vote was organised to resolve long-term disputes with neighboring Greece, which has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has already established that the name of the northern neighbours affects claims on its territory and has been opposed several times to Macedonia's request to be adopted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov (Gjorge Ivanov), one of the Plebiscitate on the change in the name, announced that he would ignore the vote.
However, the sponsors of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that the change of the title is simply a matter to be done to establish the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's God's call surrounds the churches of Harlemas fighting for existence.
"As told by the old people I spoke to earlier on each issue were beyond the bar and the gods," said Mr. Adams.
"No more one now, no more."
He admits that the removal of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"There is no more room in the living room that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money received by selling property will end sooner than expected by the leaders, "and sooner or later they will be back at the start".
For God’s sake, he adds that it may be possible to replace multilived houses with residential property where people who do not help the remaining temples will die.
"Most of the people who will buy the property of these buildings will be white," he explained, "and until that time these gods will turn away at all times, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who will enter these apartments will become members of these threats."
Both gods came into the white congregation — before Harlem became a black metropolis — in 1870, Metropolis (Metropolitan) community, and St. Martina, 10 years later.
The original White Mechanists Association collapsed in the 20th century.
The building was surrounded by a black - and - white congregation that had prayed toward God.
St. Martin's Goddess Black Association took over his holidays during John Howard Johnson (John Howard Johnson). He led the working retailer boycott who had refused to accept work or to give them a promotion in the 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem.
In 1939, Ugunsgrès seriously damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to rebuild it by ordering a call game.
His holiness was David Johnson (David Johnson), the son of Johnson and successor of St. Martina's family, and he used to call the game "the bells of the men of prayer".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural beauty" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionisio A. Linds (Dionisio A. Lind), who moved 18 years ago to the most famous game in the Riverside church.
Mr. Merrivezere (Merriweather) said that St. Martina had not replaced him.
The events of the last few months of St. Martin’s worship have reflected the relationships between architects and builders, some of whom were attracted by the secular power, others being the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The Council of Friends, formed by temporary leaders, in July referred in writing to the diocese with concern that the diocese "will "expect costs" to the Council, although the Council has not been involved in the agreement of the architects and builders sent to the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the functioning of the diocese.
Haizivs took 13 years of age a half-life at the place of fishing
On the sixth day in California, Hayev attacked 13 - year - old son who was born after the bears and raped him. It was the first day of the Omar season, the story of the ministry.
The explosion took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the town of Beacon's Beach.
Chad Hammels (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he had been nervous with his friends about half an hour in the morning when he heard that his son was calling for help, and then the group came to him to help him get out of the water.
Hammels explained that at first he had thought that it was just a feeling about the nocturnal bear, but then he realized that the son cried "I am told!
I'm sorry!"
All her key bones were broken," Hammels said, who immediately noticed it when he reached his son.
"I cry so everyone knows the water: "It's hot in the water!" Hammels added.
A son with air transport was transferred to Reidija (Rady) Children’s Hospital, Sandjego, where his condition was recognized as critical.
No known species of infected sharks are known.
Larys Jäils (Lary Giles) released media reports that some weeks earlier there had been a hijacking in this area, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails adds that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the rumps.
For the purposes of the investigation and safety purposes, the authorities closed access to platmals from Ponto Beach in Casasblad until Swami (Swami's) Encinitas (Encinitas) in the city.
John pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most are not considered to be dangerous humans.
Sanisbury's plans to press on the United Kingdom's beauty market
"Sainsbury's" is under attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with universal-style beauty products for hairdressers and trained sellers.
As part of a significant contribution to the United Kingdom’s large beauty market, which continues to grow, although fashion and household items are falling, the 11 countries will be tested for more quality products in the market and, if all of them are successful, the next year will be more.
In the heating sector, funds are invested when large companies are looking for opportunities to use shoes that were previously selected for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sanisbury's reported that you would double your offers in the area of beauty capture up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more locations with marking zones, such as "Boots" in business.
The company also re-markets its "Boutique" decorative cosmetic line, where most of the products will be friendly to vehicles, which is increasingly required by the newest buyers in the years.
In addition, the wholesaler of spices, Fragrance Shop, has tried the concession in two Sanisbury's shops, the first of which was opened in the last week in Croydon, London, but the second will be opened in Seliou (Selly Oak) Birmingham, later this year.
Buying on the Internet and moving to small daily food purchases means that large businesses have to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Sanisbury's Executive Director Mike Koups (Mike Coupe) has said that goods trading sites will become increasingly similar to universal businesses because the trade chain is trying to fight with discounts "Aldi" and "Lidl", offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Saninsbury's has located "Argos" trading sites in several hundred shops and has opened several "Habits" since the purchase of both chains two years ago, which, as it is claimed, has improved the price of goods and has made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmacovigilance sections ended with acid.
The Sanisbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in early 2000, but the Union was in conflict with how to share income from the large-scale commodity business.
The new strategy developed after Sanisbury's sold its 281 major pharmaceutical business to the owner of the chain "Celesio", "Lloyds Pharmacy" for 125 million trucks 3 years ago.
According to this plan, Lloyds' task will complement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin combinations, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), the trade director of Sanisbury's, said: "In order to improve the thinking of the buyers, we have transformed our beauty products' hairline look and the impact it produces.
We have also invested resources in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to give advice.
Our marking range has been designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment to the point where it is easy to find means that we are now forced on the road to beauty, a goal that leads to past purchases."
Peter John's "full of numbers" after Hollya Willowbia rejects 11 million cargo transactions
The "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "has taken no note" after Holly Willoughby, director of TV production, rejected 11 million racing transactions with his lifestyle label to focus all attention on his new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Viloubies don't have time to pay for their home fees and accessories "Truly".
After business was compared to the "Goop" brand of Gwyneth Paltrovas (Gwyneth Paltrow).
"This Morning" was 37 years old, using Instagram to announce that she's walking away.
Hollya Viloubija has forgotten the "Dragons Den" star in the dreams of Peter Jones because she recently emerged from her profitable life-style brand business — to focus all attention on her new big contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
The information sources claim that Jones was "full of money" when a TV gold girl met at her business residence in Marlow (Marlow), Buckinghamshire (Buckinghamshire) on Tuesday, announced that her new contracts, which are worth up to 1.5 million yards, mean that she no longer has time to pay for her house fees and accessories label "Truly".
The company was compared to the Gwinetas Platrovas mark "Goop" and, according to the house, it will double increase the wealth of Viloubia, which, as a result, achieves 11 million trucks.
When Viloubija (37) used Instagram to announce that the "Truly" earthquake had taken Jones from Britain to one of his own homes.
As a source of information, "Truly" was the main priority of Holly's priorities.
It would have to be her long - term future for the next decade.
Her decision to stand up surprised all the non-prepared participants.
No one could have done what happened the other day: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlova there is a warehouse for full sale of ready goods."
Experts believe that this morning's leader, one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions of dollars to the company because very much of the money has been invested in various products — from clothes and shoes, to clothes and goods at home, and will be even more delayed in placing them on the market.
And that can mean the long - term end of friendship.
Viloubija’s mother and her husband, Dens Boldvins (Dan Baldwin) have maintained close relations with Jones and his wife Taru Kapp for 10 years.
Viloubia "Truly" was created with Kepu in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as President in March.
Both shared holidays, and Jounsam owns 40% of the shares in the Boldvina TV producer company.
Viloubiya has to become a member of the brand M&S, and she will be replaced by Entu McPartlin as ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
John's close source announced last night: "We don't want to comment on his business!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was aware of the criticism received from the news companies about a comment that some might recognize as "the President unapproachable", and that he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why is the President so much to refuse?
Tramps said in his photo "known dictator" voice.
"I won't give up any of it!"
He pointed out that Kim has shown interest in meeting again once again after Tramps recognized a great step against North Korea's denuclearization in its early stages in Singapore in June.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have ceased.
More than three months after June, one of the leading North Korean diplomats Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see the US "response" response" to the initial steps towards the fight against North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining restraint.
Tramps was much more optimistic in his mythical speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were preparing for war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that what he had done to improve his relationship with Kim has given positive results — stopping the rocket test, helping to release hostages, and returning home from American military service.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's just to create the President's influence, but instead of putting 10,000 people out there who would try to get into this densely populated area, we have 200, wait, here," Tramps said, pointing at the effort right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia set up an island to kill hundreds of people
Following the earthquake in Lomboka, for example, non-governmental organisations abroad were told that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboka were transferred, the situation of the national disaster was not explained, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a known problem," said Mrs. Sumbunga (Sumbun) youth.
Although "Save the Children" gathers groups to go to Pala, it is still not clear whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr Sutopo, representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that the Indonesian authorities are considering the situation of Pala to see whether international agencies can make their contributions.
In view of the fact that earthquakes are taking place regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely poor in nature.
Although in Aceh (Aceh) there are cases of condoms, they are rarely found along other coasts.
Likely, people’s injuries were also affected by the fact that Paul did not ignore the warning sirens about tsunamis, although the warning was valid.
Even the best time to move between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters add up to the burden of logistics.
The ship’s hospital, which had moved to Lombo to treat earthquakes, is now going to Pal, but it will take at least three days to reach the new post office victims.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) has made improvements in the complex infrastructure of Indonesia as a central point of the campaign, and he has given large amounts to roads and railways.
However, there is a lack of resources that has failed Mr. Joko's administration and he is waiting for a re-election next year.
In addition, Mr. Joko has to deal with a serious problem that is causing tension between the consequences of Indonesia, where most Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were killed in their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought along the streets using knives, knives, and guns and other primary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Starijs with a wheel restores balance in the game against "Chelsea"
Daniel's Starridge (Daniel Sturridge) saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea's premier at the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Starage received a game from Jerdan Shakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea gate when his team lost by 1:0.
He moved the bomb a little to the left of him and then pushed the bomb towards the next door.
In this attempt, the bomb flew up into the field, reaching the top of the network.
The bomb finally flew over the head of Cape Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) in the river and entered the network.
"I've just tried to get this position to be on the bomb, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I'll just try to get myself as long as possible," Starijs explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Kante (Kante) approaching, the bomb was blown away, and, without much thought, the force."
"Chelsea" was headed at 1:0 after 25 minutes after the words came from the White Star Eden Azards (Eden Hazard).
The "Blues" attacker played the bomb back to Mateo Kovačić (Mateo Kovacic), before turning towards the middle of the field and at the maximum speed of moving along the "Liverpool" field.
Kovači quickly played and received a bomb back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful wall between the players by allowing Azardam to get into the area.
Azards was able to speed up the protection and finished the combination with the left leg of the next pillar of the network, along the "Liverpool" of Elison Becker (Alisson Becker).
Liverpool will fight "Napoli" on Wednesday at 3.00 a.m. "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples, Italy.
"Chelsea" with "Videoton" will be held in London on Thursday at 15.00 a.m.
The number of victims in Indonesia reaches 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, announced by the state disaster agency on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been displaced from the roofs of buildings after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that visited the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) high, reported at the news conference by the agency’s representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Supopo Purwo Nugroho).
Many cities where more than 380,000 people lived were surrounded by broken - down buildings.
Police suspects women's rape arrest 32-year-old men
The examination of psychiatry was initiated after this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
At age 44, a 44-year-old bull was found at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews Street and suspected that he had been arrested by a 32-year-old man.
The police have called on people in this family who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Braiens O'Hagans (Brian O'Hagan) reported: "The investigation has just started, but I would like to call on everyone who was around John's street and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on every taxi drivers, especially those who might have fixed something in their car video recorders' materials, to contact us because they may have important information for our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenheda and was found in her possession.
On this afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have entered a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation will continue, and as the police reported, they are working with the closest relatives to the victim.
The taxi driver who lived in Greisonmjuz tried to get back to his apartment, but the police replied that no one could enter or leave the building.
He could not say a word when he knew what had happened.
People will be informed that it will take hours to get them back.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that the whole family was covered as a crime scene.
In the scene of the crime, women appeared in the camps.
She continues: "It's so funny!"
On two afternoons there were two police trucks in the back of the truck, and one was placed right outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the corridor and controlled the house of a multi-living animal.
All who have information are asked to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September to call 101 or contact "Crimestopers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 named 247.
Cromvela's status in Parliament becomes the latest record-recording scandal
The rejection would be ethically justified in view of the similar activities of Taliban, which resulted in so many memories of the culture and religion of England.
However, Mr Crick’s proposal by Cromwell’s company, however, marked "the impasse" and "the attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmits (John Goldsmith), president of the Cromvela society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the withdrawal of the status quo, it was inevitable that Olivera Cromvela would also become a figure outside the town of Westminster.
Cromwell himself did not consent to perform or perform the celebration during the war of England’s citizens.
It is possible that corrupt Cromvels will be victimized by his predecessor, centuries ago by the actions of Thomas.
Sera William Hemo Sorneikroff (Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft) is a 19th-century view of Cromvela and is part of the history of a person who, many believe, is still worthy of approval.
Mr. Goldsmith (Goldsmith) informed Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells — perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century — considered Parliament's defence against external pressure, which, of course, was monarchy.
There will be further historical discussions on whether this is really an accurate picture of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has established our future development of our nation, and Cromvels is a recognized personality that represents one of the long-term dividends.
She's achieved, being a Lord's Protector, it's worth stirring up and remembering."
Cúka-slapkava to the death of farmers in China
According to information on local media, a pig was attacked and killed by a farmer in the southern Chinese market.
The man, mentioned only by his name, Yuan, was found dying of excess artery, all in one blood of pigs on the market in Lupanshui Province, Guidžo (Guizhou), reports "South China Morning Post".
The pig is ready to inject vaccines into pigs in pigs in the Chinese province of Xining (Qinghai) on May 30, 2005.
It is reported that he and his brother had returned from the nearby province of June to sell 15 chickens on the market on the third day.
The next morning, her brother discovered that men had died and found that the dog’s neck door was open.
He told me that there was a big pig's father with blood on his mouth.
According to the information provided by the court, the medical investigation confirmed that the heavy web of 550 trucks (~249 kg) had drowned the farmer.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother, "it's just named Vu (Wu), "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan entered the market about 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John did not belong either to him or to his brothers.
The Market Manager informed "Evening News" that the website was closed to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to information, Juan’s family and market management discussed the compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, they are known for other dog attacks.
In 2016 the dog attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Masačüsets, as a result of which the man suffered a critical blow.
More than 10 years ago, 650 pigs (~295 kg) were forced to farm in Vels until his wife died.
After the farmers visited his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba explained that dogs are not usually aggressive, but the blood can act as a "pistos".
"It's just rotary.
They like to bite, they're very scientific... They don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Orcán Roza's conclusion brings to mind a wide and powerful case in the southern United States
As predicted, Orcan Roza, heading across the highest waters on the northern coast of Mexico, will be weakened.
However, in the near future, Rosa will bring floods in the north of Mexico and in the southern United States.
Five afternoons (from the time of North America) Rose’s wind speed reached 143 km/h (85 hours) corresponding to category 1 Orcan and its point was 620 km (385 miles) south of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
As soon as over the Pacific Ocean, the low pressure is formed, moving east toward the east, towards the east coast of the United States. Roza with tropical wind power approaching the side of Lake California (Baja California), it will start its first day with a deep mass of moisture from the tropical island heading north to the southern United States.
In the early part of the day, Rosa brought up to 10 hills (~25.4 cm).
Then the tropical meltdown, in collaboration with the nearby low pressure surface, will create a wide range of case gas zones in the near future in the South.
1–4 columns (~2,6–10,2 cm) of cases will result in rapid floods, double currents and possibly earthquakes.
Deaths from the troupe range will result in lithium gases which will occur at 2-3 inches (~5.1-7.6 cm) per hour, particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
The southern part, especially in Arizona, is expected to reach up to 24 hills (~5.2–10.1 cm).
A rapid deterioration in the rapid state of affairs is possible due to the breakdown of tropical waste gas.
It is very difficult to walk on foot because of the dangers of tropical gas.
Strong cases can turn cannons into fast waves, but the fire will bring local bursts of wind and violent winds.
The pressure on the ground will be brought to the attention of the southern California border lines in part of the local powerful case.
It is possible that lead gases that together exceed half the neck (~1.3 cm) and may cause small double flow and smooth roads.
It will be the first case gas in the region in the secret season.
Some of the tropical greenhouse gases released to Arizona will be approaching late on Sunday and around Monday, before it will take over the wider area later on Monday and around Tuesday.
On the second day, powerful events will take place in the Fourth Century region (DR Colorado, DA Juta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last for a whole third day.
In October there is possible intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S., as Arctic temperatures will decline, but tropical temperatures are still quite hot.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in small distances.
This is an example of the dramatic difference in temperature on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature in the city of Kansas, Misüri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demoin (Des Moines), Io, is almost 20 degrees.
In the days to come, we will try to build and expand the long summer heat.
It is expected that in most of the central and eastern parts of the United States, the beginning of October will be warm, reaching 80 degrees and more (through Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsia) in large areas from the south to the north.
The temperature in New York City on the second day could reach 80 degrees (through Farenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsius), which would exceed about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts show that the average will be higher in the first half of October in the eastern part of the United States.
More than 20 million people attended the hearing in the case of Britta Caveno
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday in six television channels with disgust, as High Court candidate Brets Kaveno (Brett Kavanaugh) and Christine Blasey Ford (Christine Blasey Ford), who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which, according to a woman, took place in the 1980 ’ s.
As long as there was no political distinction, radio companies continued to stop regular traffic in order to report on the latest Friday events: an agreement organized by Senator Jeff Fleika (Jeff Flake) that the FBI will investigate the charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate Justice Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had buried her in her grave and tried to escape during the middle school ball.
Cavano’s conviction was unmistakably confirmed by the fact that he was completely convinced that this was not happening.
According to Nielsen's report on Friday, 20.4 million people saw it all.
The company CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the average viewer interest.
Data on other radio organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated them, were not available immediately.
And "Nielsen" usually causes problems, including people who are in charge of the offices.
To get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of closing games or Oskara ceremony observers.
The Fox News Channel, which commented strongly on the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million all day long listening, reported "Nielsen".
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC — 2.89 million, but CNN — 2.52 million, reported "Nielsen".
The interest continued to grow even after the hearing.
Flix was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After having published a statement that he was voting for the appointment of Kaveno, the senator noted CNN and CBS's camera on Friday morning when he, led by the complainant's summary hearing, tried to enter the hearing of the Justice Committee with an elevator.
On the right-hand side of the CNN, he stood for several minutes in front of the eyes as a wreck.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you belong to power while so many women are powerless."
Fleks explained that his team had made a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he was informed that he still had something to say to him during the committee hearing.
The cable networks and radio organisations were represented on the radio several hours later when the Justice Committee was preparing to vote on Kaveno's vote in Senate.
However, Fleks claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look at the complaints raised by the candidates, which had been asked by a minority of democracy.
Fleik partially confirmed the negotiations with his friend democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After negotiations with Künsa and several other senators, Fleks made his decision.
The choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans did not have a vote to approve Kaveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FBI to investigate the charges against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of political games for Brexita
In an interview by Prime Minister Teréza Meja, the newspaper "Sunday Times" accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and national interests.
The British Prime Minister Teresa Meja will attend a Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to the interview with his first page in his newspaper, Minister of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson continues to attack his Brexite plan on the future relationship with the United Kingdom, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use one another's tariffs is "completely absurd".
Form Simsa arrest: The police have arrested Ditheon Simpson, who suspects LSU player's secretion
The police have arrested suspects of arresting Vida Sims (Wayde Sims), a 20-year-old LSU basketballist.
The 20-year-old Ditheons Simpson (Dytheon Simpson) was arrested and arrested as a second-stage spy, reported by the Baton Rouge police.
Amateman broadcasts a video showing Simsa's confrontation with Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the castle.
CBS daughter company WAFB reports that the police were found in the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After Simpson's understanding, the police informed him that he was aware of the arrest of Vida.
As reported by a lawyer, he was awarded $350,000 for high security money.
The team of medical experts of the Eastern Baton Rouge Parish (East Baton Rouge Parish) runs on Friday to a temporary conclusion, which states that death caused the head of this fractured neck.
The Department thanked the State police research group in Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the South University Police and the people of the Territory for their research on the outcome of the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial law guards for their "professiveness and justice of work".

Vulcan spreads profits across Mexico
Fulls from the Pokatepetla volcano have reached the southern tip of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans that they should not be near the volcano within 24 hours after the event was observed in the factory and 183 gas and profit emissions were recorded.
The Centre observed numerous promotions and promotions.
Pictures on social networks showed that the car windscreen in Mexico’s family, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), is located with a plan of profits.
The geophysicians have noted 45 July (72 kilometres) south of the activation of the volcano in the capital city, since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake destroyed the central part of Mexico in 2017.
Vulcan, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the year of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the sixth day following an independent meeting of protestors with the police of the public order and when thousands joined in protest demonstrations to mark the first year since the Catholic polarisation vote on separation.
The group of masked supporters who had been stopped by the public order police had to wear them with eggs and had to wear a powdered color by forming dark powder boxes on the streets that would usually be full of tourists.
Inconsistencies arose today too later, and police were using knives to prevent seizures.
Several hours of independent support groups were involved in protesting, "Don't forget and don't give up!", and they were faced with the unity-supporting protesters who complained, "Lands of eternity for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 40 people were given medical assistance because of the severe trauma they experienced during protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid recognizes as illegal but which has been induced by Catholics, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains a major issue.
The voters were convinced that independence, although the voter activity was low, and those who were opposed to separation were most afraid to vote.
According to the Catholic official, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote at the polls throughout the region, and there were cruel harassment.
Independent support groups had been set up on Friday night to prevent demonstrations of State police support.
The demonstration took place, but the protesters were forced to choose another route.
Narciss Teremez (Narcis Termes), 68 - year - old electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, admits that he no longer believes that Catholicism will gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw how my parents ’ eyes filled with joy at the tears of their joy that they had been allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties which support the independence of Catalonia have won a small but significant victory in the last year's regional elections, these parties have fought to maintain the trend this year, since many of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or have been persecuted and waited for the court to organize their referendums and its subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old engineer Hoans Puigs (Joan Puig), who was filming for police support on the phone, said that the conflict had been sparked by both sides' politics.
"The challenge is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine leaders of the Catholic Church, Uriol Zünkrez (Oriol Junqueras), who has been in detention from the previous year to the court, announced that he will apply for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Candidacy of Europe's elections is the best way to recall democratic values and the repressions that the Government of Spain has directed against us," he said.
London: Men arrested after entering the car building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years old) were arrested after the car was repeatedly attacked against the building in London.
The incident took place at the Ballinagard Crescent (Ballynagard Crescent) on Thursday about 19.30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings (Bob Blemmings) informed that the doors were damaged and also the building itself.
It is possible that at the same time, the machine was pulled out of the van.
The Mengas Tricinen lets "Livingston" with 1-0 win "Rangers"
Dollija Menga (Dolly Menga) gave the first door to the "Livingston" victory
"Livingston" supported the "Rangers" by giving Stephen Gerard his second loss in 18 games called "Ibrox" club manager.
Dollija Mengas's shout appeared decisive because the Geria Holt (Gary Holt) team compared the situation to "Hibernian".
Jérard's team in this season won't win the guests, and tomorrow they'll have to meet with the leader "Hearts", from which they're left behind for eight points.
Before that, the European Union adopted the "Rangers" wine "Rapid" on Thursday.
Until "Livingston" extended its series without losses in the division to six games, and the main coach Holts has not yet heard of the chaos since last month, Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
"Livingston" does not use option for blue guests
Holta's team with its direct game, which in various ways weighed "Rangers", had to find in the lead long before they got the words.
Skott Robinsons (Scott Robinson) fired, but fired his attempt at the gate, then Alana Litgow (Alan Lithgow) attempt to break the chain of the Greek Halkett (Craig Halkett) with head across the gate was unsuccessful.
Farmers allowed Rangers to play before them, knowing that they will be able to accommodate guests in the planned places.
And that's the way to get rid of the decisive barriers.
"Rangers" was released, and "Livingston" used corridors, Declans Gallagher (Declan Gallagher) and Robinsons assembled to give Menga an opportunity to sit and enjoy the spaces from the center of the area.
At this stage, Rangers managed the bomb, but the protection of the guests proved to be unwarranted and no one was particularly disturbed by Liam Kelly.
This continued on the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) told Kelli to save his words.
Skota Pitman's attempt to stop the activities of the Rangers host Alana McGregora, and Litgovs is buried in the deep doors in the Livingston combination.
In the "Livingston" zone, two calls continued to appear, but after Halketa's fight against the bomb with the replacement Glenn Middleton (Glenn Middleton) and the play with the hand were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" supply — analysis
Scotland BBC Alsdairs Lamont (Alasdair Lamont) "Tony Macaroni"
Fenomal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great as they continued to look forward to the future, constantly improving their supply of spiritual food.
Their game style and personality has virtually not changed since their return to the upper echelon, but Holts has won great praise for how he has released the team since his entry.
He had so much money.
Captain Halket (Halkett) was a climber, holding the first organized defense, while Menga provided Connors Goldsons (Connor Goldson) and Joe Vorals (Joe Worrall) with a constant motility.
But Rangers is missing.
No matter how good they were to Gerard at times, they were far from those standards.
Their last bomb was rough — only once they entered the farmer's field — and it's actually an invitation to rest "Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting for shared feelings
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany were on their way to Berlin, there were many cold and blue skies.
This is the last day President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO associations.
They have differences of opinion on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Then Erdogan went to Cielni to open a new giant museum.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
As a reason for security, the police blocked 25,000 people's great efforts without allowing them to stand before the museum, but many of the supporters soon went out to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — a large part of them who were religious — also took note of their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take them into their own hands.
The mutual protests of both sides reflect the contradictions created by the guests whose part of Germany is considered by Turkey to be a power, but others fail as an autocrat.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: a passenger dies in traffic with a car
In a car accident in London, a bus driver was injured.
The crossing took place in the Bestwood Street along the river Evelyn Street, along the road with intensive traffic in Deptford (Deptford), in the southeastern city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and he helped the doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The transaction took place several months after another passenger died on the streets of Çalders (Childs Street), about half of the day's transaction site.
The police officer of the capital announced that the police are working on the identification of a man and informing his relatives.
Roads and buses are closed at the location of the event, but drivers are advised to stay away from this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during an accident
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in an accident in the strict regime of men.
The incident occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire about 09.30 BST on Sunday and will continue.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners and restricted to one pass, the staff of the Special Service "Tornado" were involved
The workers were treated with mild facial injuries at the site of the event.
The representative of the Prison Service announced: "In order to resolve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to trauma.
We will not deal with violence in our prisons and we clearly say that the responsible will be transferred to the police and perhaps spend more time behind the rest."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the head of the patient in a medical hospital following an attack by the victim.
And last October, officials responsible for the control of dumping were sent to prison to deal with serious irregularities that had hit personnel with billiard bombs.
Orcán Roza Fénikisai, Lasvegasi and Soltlexitia are threatened with sudden floods (probably benefiting from the situation in the drylands)
Arizona from tropical depression is rarely suffering, but it is likely to occur around the beginning of the next week when Orcan Rose with the remaining force will move across the narrow southern regions, creating a rapid flow risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden floods on the east and west of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, the southern part of California and the southern part of Juta, including Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Soltlexitia.
It is expected that Rosa will move directly across Phoenix on the second day, starting with the case later on.
The National Meteorological Service in Fenikas Twitter reported that since 1950, only "ten tropical cycles have been preserved in a tropical wind or depression status of 200 Jews (320 km) on the Fenika radio!
Katrina (1967) was an Orcan 40th (65 km) from the AZ border."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2-4 pillars (~5.08–10.2 cm) of lithium gas, reaching up to 6 pillars (15.24 cm).
Other south-easterly areas, including the central part of the Klinš Mountains and the Large Basin, can be obtained from 1-2 hills (~2.54-5.08 cm), reaching 4 hills (~10.2 cm).
Those who are not subject to the risk of sudden floods may become objects of celebration because the region has been visited by drought.
Although the possibility of abstinence may be very serious, some of the cases are likely to be beneficial because the southern regions are currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. drying Monitor, at least 40 per cent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme dryness, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First of all, the Orcan Roza road to Lejascalifornia (Baja California) in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Roza still has Orcan power from morning to morning at maximum wind speed 85 miles (137 km), is around 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eigenia (Point Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north with 12 miles (19 km).
Winds are made up of hottest ocean waters and therefore reach.
It is therefore expected that the hurricane with tropical wind will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday or from morning.
In the case of gas, Mexico may be strong by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that Lithium gas will reach 3-6 inches (7,62-15.24 cm) from the southern part of the interior of Sonora, located in the southeastern part of Lejascalifornia, to cuts, possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," said weather.com.
Rosa will turn north, across Mexico as a tropical wind and then reach the Arizona border on the second day of the morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross the Arizona and arrive in the south of Yuta on the following evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or her remnants is very strong case gas in Lejascalifornia, the northern part of Sonora and the southernmost parts of the United States," the National Centre of Orcans said.
It is expected that these cases will result in a life-threatening flood and double floods and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Injury Midsummer Norton: four arrested for a secretion test
Three - and - a - half - year - old man was arrested suspected of attempted rape after a 16 - year - old boy was found in Somerset.
The captured teenagers were found in the territory of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, about 4.00 BST.

The police have called on anyone who might have a mobile phone material for what happened.
Tramps claims that Kaveno is a victim of the Democratic Party "Bad and Dreams"
"The vote of Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting in Villing (Wheeling), West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno is a victim of the "evil and dream" of the Democratic Party during its appointment process.
Cavano witnessed before Congress, where he strongly and emotionally banned any accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Forda also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the President announced that "Americans have been obsessed with" Kaveno "excellence, capacity and fear".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated jurists of our time with spousal history of service to the people," he said to the supporters' efforts in West Virginia.
The appointment of President Kaveno referred to the environment with regard to the importance of interdependency in the activities of the Republican people.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I was not a candidate, but I was a candidate in fact," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps argues that Democrats have taken the mission "to protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important procedures in the Senate on the appointment of Caveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior assistant of the management of the Republican party.
Hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims increased
On Saturday, at least 384 people were told that they were killed, many were simply devastated when giant waves flew against the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavakis.
On Friday at the festival in Palu, hundreds of people had gone to the shrines on the beach when up to six meters (18 feet) of high valleys ran up against the coastal road, killing many and maiming everything they found on their way.
Cunami emerged after a strong earthquake of 7.5 balls.
"When the tsunami threatened last night, people were still working in the mud and didn't run away immediately, and they became victims," BNPB representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) informed freely in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't go alone, it brought cars, balloons and buildings, it attracted everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the cunami, before crossing the coast, had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people beat their bones to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
Many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and water seized are seen in the photos taken by the disaster agency.
After the harvest, the neighboring city continued to enjoy the harvest on the sixth day.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area where 2.4 million people lived.
In the Communication from the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency on BPPT, the five-day mass-distributed power of land was more than 200 times greater than the nuclear energy allocated to Hiroshimu during World War II.
The city’s location was long, and at the end of the narrow line it may have strengthened the town’s size.
The posts were described as "wide" and reported to thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels.
He said that some victims found corpses buried under the collapsed walls, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost.
Nugroho recognises that the number of victims and posts could be larger along the coastal line 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala (Dongal), which is located near the earthquake epicentram.
"The communications "was completely distorted, no information was received from Dongal," Nugroho reported.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Sarkanais Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers go to disaster-affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could be even worse," the organization reported.
On the sixth day, the Agency was strongly criticized for not informing the customs that they had visited Pal, even though officials claimed that the waves had issued a warning.
A video distributed on social networks is heard that a man at the top of the building is calling out to people on the street under the street that they are approaching the tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall runs across the coast, breaking down buildings and cars.
The news agency "Reuters" could not immediately verify whether the material is true.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply that had shut down the Pala communication, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities reported that the army had begun to send cargo aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other essential items.
The city airport has only been opened for aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) is planning to visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that World Vision workers who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala (Donggal) and now had a sudden departure from the office at the base of the office were on their way to the blood of the dead.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were damaged," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when the aid groups were committed to organizing assistance to victims of disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Pala with great experience.
In accordance with the Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and staff of marine organisations may only be provided that the post-field is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani (Aulia Ariani), representative of the Indonesian Red Cross in Sarkana.
"When the government announces, "Well, it's a national disaster," we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been established."
When Paul arrived the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members who were still missing continued to look forward to seeing his love become a miracle that makes life more vivid during natural disasters.
On the sixth day of the event, a small child was separated.
On Sunday the survivors released a woman who was forced under two days of forced labor near her mother’s bedside.
Gendon Subbandon (Gendon Subannon), the trainer of the Indonesian national team, had prepared two of the unknown Asian football players that took place this month in Indonesia.
Others from the hotel "Roa Roa", including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their foster.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I'm learning the emotional burden."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after spreading news in the paragliding team of Roa Roa Hotel, he successfully sent "WhatsApp" reports to the Palu scientists who participated in the Pladmal Festival.
However, the result of his report was only one single note, not two green notes.
"I think that means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
Loans are outstanding at $26,750 at the "Newport on the Levee" complex
According to a statement by the Department of Police in Newport (Newport), the savings of 26,750 dollars for the Brink's employee, who completed the Newport on the Levee complex on Friday morning.
"The driver of the car lost the ATM distribution complex and was prepared to fill it with more money," wrote Detective Denis Makkarijs (Dennis McCarthy) in the press release.
While the manager was hired, another man "from behind the back came forward to "Brink's" employee" and seized the money for the banknote.
According to the press release, the witnesses observed several suspicious persons leaving the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information on their identity should contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: reekers change their name to Je
Reperis Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
Noting about the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Between who used to be known as Kanji West."
The 41-year-old West has been called Je for a while, and used the name "Ye" as its eight-year-old album, published in June.
This change takes place before he shows up on this "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to listen to his new album "Yandhi".
Shovo's authors tell us that he is replacing singer Arian Grandi, who has interrupted the work of "emotional causes".
Vest has told us that this is not only a summary of his current professional word but also a religious role.
"I believe that "Ye" is the name most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You," West explained earlier this year, discussing his album's name with the radio director Big Boy (Big Boi).
"Then I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first there was Kanja, which means "only one, followed it "Ye," which is thought of as good and bad ours, as ours, about everything.
The album is more focused on what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who has changed their names.
Sons Kombs (Sean Combs) who have so far been known as Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he gives priority to the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love's Brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with the West, has neither used the sign nor the large letters.
The elected President of Mexico accuses the non-use of the army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuels Lopez Obrador (Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador) has promised never to use military force against civilians during the 50th anniversary of the blood-reparation of students.
Lopess Obradors promised on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" "never use the army to force the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the peaceful demonstration of the Army unit was followed by the killing of 300 people at the time of the left-wing movement of students throughout Latin America.
Lopess Obradors has been committed to supporting new Mexicans in years, offering scholarships to students each month and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education would lead young criminals into gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field by a clear investor and an artificial intelligence practical Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee) who has worked "Google", "Micro" and "Apple".
The comments were made after several U.S. government bodies had made announcements about artificial intelligence, although the overall lack of a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the past year, China has started its plan: its objective is to become the country’s main art intellectual centre by 2030.
"The biannual research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so much left behind in the United States, and there is the prospect of the next cardinal shift in artificial intelligence," Li said.
In an interview with the CNBC this week, Li said that double funding could double increase the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States.
Lí, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("Artificial Intelligence Power: China, Silicon Street and the New World Order") this month, published "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", as the Executive Director of the Synoding Ventures", which has contributed funds to one of the most important artistic intelligence companies in China "Face++".
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melona) University worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would re-examine the best "Othello" player in America, but later he was the "Micro Research" leading employee and "Google" president of the China branch.
It recognises the sciences of technology organized by the former U.S. government, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and the question when it will be prepared in the future in order to identify people with ideas for the future".
"Scientists often have to work very hard to get government gifts," Li said.
"Not now China is making leading scientists, but also large companies," he explained.
"Facebook", "Google" and other technology companies have hired university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
It adds that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should automatically be given to people with a PhD degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
It was made clear that the National Natural Science Fund of China provides funding for people in academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, which provide money to US researchers, but the academic quality of work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department of the United States of America has established a joint artistic intelligence centre, which is intended to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and the Baltics have informed him of the establishment of a special committee on matters of artistic intelligence.
And this month DARPA (Central Research and Development Organisation of the Ministry of Defence) announced $2 billion in large investments in the initiative called "AI Next".
On the other hand, the National Science Fund is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence studies.
As long as the United States legislation, which was responsible for the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, is no longer working for several months.
The Macedonians voted in the referendum on the change in the name of the State
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the "Northern Macedonian Republic" by taking a step that would lead to decades of long-term dialogue with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbour's name shows claims on its territory and has been responsible for the adoption of old Macedonia by NATO and the EU.
The two Governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists in the opposition argue that the change would result in the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanovs (Gjorge Ivanov) said that the non-voting referendum, and the campaign called for a vote, had raised concerns as to whether there would be at least 50% of the electoral activities required for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The reference note asks the question: "Are you involved in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the change of title, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev (Zoran Zaev), argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that have been created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to become an organisation such as the EU and NATO members.
"I have come to vote for the future of the state, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely, in the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgeevska (Olivera Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, there will be a 2/3 majority in Parliament.
The Commission informed the country's election that no infringements were reported until one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, which voted 66 per cent of the registered voters.
"I'm going to vote for my child, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Joe Tanevski (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zajevs of Macedonia, his wife, Zorika (Zorica) and his son Duško (Dushko) in the Macedonian referendum on the change in the name of the country which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, gave its vote in Strumica (Strumica) in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov) prepared a small view and arranged for rooms where the people in the referendum are present.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to step in with the head, not through the door of service," Kavadarkovs said.
"We are a small country, but we have an estate.
If they don't like us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs claims that NATO participation will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that most of the votes will vote because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after voting.
He said the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
In the previous morning's consultation of the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, 30–43 per cent of the voters will participate in the referendum — less than the necessary activity.
Another consultation of Macedonia's Telema TV found that 57 per cent of the voters are scheduled to participate in the Sunday vote.
70 percent of them replied that the vote was about.
For the referendum to be successful, the activities of the voters must be 50 per cent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious threat to the Western-oriented government which came to power last May.
See: Mančestras "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) is en route to the entire "Brighton" protection to get the tickets
Serhio Agvero and Rahīm Sterlings (Raheem Sterling) provided "Brighton" protection by allowing Manchester "City" on Saturday at the "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win with 2:0.
Agvero was impressed that his reputation for winning the race at 65 minutes was very light.
The Argentinian attacker received a game in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He broke out between three Brighton defenses, and spent years in the open field.
Then Agvero surrounded four green crates.
He carried a bomb to one guard, then he survived several more Brighton in the field.
Then he played the game on the left when he reached Sterling.
The English center's attacker used his first shot to play back Agvero, who had a good football taste in case to reach the "Brigton" Metjø Rayen (Mathew Ryan), drawing the bomb on the right side of the network.
"Agvero fights with foot problems," "City" manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We discussed with him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were told that he was getting names at that time.
But it was Sterlings that provided the original advantage of Sky Blues at the Premier.
The doors were reached at 29 minutes.
Agvero received a bomb deep in Brighton territory during that game.
He sent a bomb with a beautiful bridge across Leroy Sane on the left leg of the Leroy Sane.
In June he made several trips until he was confident that Sterling would deliver the bomb to the next door.
The attacker of the Sky Blues centre was easy to land on the bomb network just before crossing the border.
The "City" contests with "Hoffenheim" Championships will be held on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. at the "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherser wants to give you the "Rockies" problems
Since "Nationals" does not participate in closing games, there was no reason to start again.
But Čercers (Scherzer), who is always ready to compete, wants to take advantage of the option against Colorado "Rockies", but only if "Rockies" is going to be the current closing game. And "Rockies" in the National League of West is run by one game against Los Angeles "Dodgers".
"Rockies" have printed at least a white card with five o'clock in the evening with 5:2 winning "Nationals", but have not yet won its first title in the divide.
"Even if we play the same game, we will at least be able to pretend, knowing that the airstrip here, in Denver, with effort and second team, may be the worst I'll ever deal with this year.
And why would I not like to compete?"
"Nationals" have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as you know, Sherzer is ready to make a date.
The speaker, to whom it will begin in the early 34th, held a half-session on the outside of the Bullpen section on Thursday, and on Sunday the usual rest of the year will be bombed.
The "Washington" lab is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 direct 220 2/3 innings in this season.
The Tramps handle the meths in the West Virginia
The President reminded the environment of the situation in which his elected High Court candidate, Brets Kaveno, spoke at the same time about the importance of interlocutory elections of Republican voters.
"In November everything we've done is threatened.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
It's really very, very serious – I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this ridiculous, ridiculous group of radicals of democracies that are taking place right now.
And they're committed to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, counteraction.
They have the same reward that they will experience, which they must overcome in order to gain power and control, that is why they want to get power and control, and we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have taken the mission "to protest and resist".
"And you have seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling democracy "no one, no evil, no love and no injustice."
He named it "Dianne Feinstein" by the Senator of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee of Justice (Dianne Feinstein), to which viewers responded with loud applause.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you downloaded the document?
Hmm, what's going on?
No, mmm, wait--it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Liberian Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is irrefutable against open-ended
There was no wonder that the Momentum activists at my local party wanted me to submit to the censorship.
Finally, I am so far the last member of the parliament of the Leiborist Party who has been informed that he does not want to — all because we do not hide our views.
With my colleagues in Parliament, Joanne Rayen (Joan Ryan) acted similarly because she was committed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement of the center criticised me for not supporting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, national security, of Europe – ironic – but they were issues in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Communication on the Lisbon meeting in the eastern part of Nottingema on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
The majority of the meetings that took place during the election of eight Members of my local parliament.
Unfortunately, at many meetings today, climate is different and promises of "better, safer" policies have already been forgotten if they have ever been.
It has become increasingly clear that the Leiborist party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable to the party's management.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader: colleagues I think our political views are similar, and I hope that I will base on 180 degrees and accept views that I would never agree on in other cases — whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak in public — and in fact it is not important what I say — I follow a study on the use of social networks by calling for a ban on candidates for the next elections, repressing central policy, claiming I have no place in the Leiborist party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have more than part of my colleague, because comments against me are usually political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who meet with sexual and racial harassment every day, but I never try to avoid passions.
One of the most satisfying aspects of this political era is the normal use.
In the past week, Jeremy Corbins announced that the Leiborist party must conquer the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity and with every word of mistrust or change of election rules, the party will be cut off.
Over the past two years, I have often been given advice by inviting others not to leave, thinking about what I was talking about, and then I'll be "all right".
But that is not why I decided to take part in politics.
Since I had joined the Liberians for 32 years back as a student in response to the resignation of the government of Techer, which my integrated school class had deliberately led to extinction, I have been tasked to fight for the best public services for those who need it most — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never been blind to my political views, nor to my previous wish.
No one in the east of Nottingema had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and areas that would not be acceptable to the existing government.
To those who made the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at the moment that the State has committed itself to Brexit, which will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in essence the only thing I want to announce is not the idea of the "Momentum" Event, but to its voters, regardless of whether they are members of liberarians: I am pleased that I can serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of being a candidate or reminders that no one in politics is irreplaceable, will not stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The "Air" reaches the top row table
The last two attempts may, to a certain extent, work out the final outcome of the match, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has won a triumph in this exciting Scottish championship match today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unspoken team of ten.
In the end it was both their great protection and their much better use of benefits that directed farmers, and Peter Murchie’s coach is all the reasons for being satisfied.
"We've checked all our games and we're still not saying, so I have to admit," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Kristy (Robyn Christie): "All respect for "Ayr," they used their benefits better than us."
Granta Anderson (Grant Anderson) tried in 14 minutes, carried out by Freziers Climo (Frazier Climo), released "Ayr", but in the yellow card of Captain Rorym Hü (Rory Hughes), where at the game was awarded "Warriers", changed the numbers "Melrose", and Jason Begott (Jason Baggot) contained an unrealistic bomb.
The climate increased "Ayr" control with punishment, right at the end of the half-hour, he won points, then realized the solo test, until it stopped "Ayr" at doses of 17-5.
But Melrose began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to realize Begots reduced the delay to 5 points.
Then there was a long stop because Ruy's Nott (Ruaryh Knott) suffered a severe trauma and was driven to the villages by lightning from the field, but when the game started "Ayr" quickly moved forward when Staford McDowell (Stafford McDowall) made an attempt to realize the climate.
Captain Blair Macpherson of "Ayr" then received a yellow card, and already, after intense pressure, "Melrose" used a left player — with a Bruse Colvine (Bruce Colvine) test that was not realized.
However, the farmers objected, and when Straans Hačinson (Struan Hutchinson) received a yellow card because the climate was blocked without bombs, from the penal corridor, Macferson made a doll of "Ayr" behind.
The climate came to an end, just as before, almost from the very beginning after Kails Rouvs (Kyle Rowe) turned David Armstrong into a field of bats and sent the flag player Gregor Henry into the fifth attempt of the farmer.
"Still Game" star, seems to be planning a new career restaurant in business
The comedy series "Still Game" star Fords Kieran (Ford Kieran) seems to be planning to engage in a business of hospitality because it revealed that he is named as the licensed director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis (Jack Jarvis) on a popular BBC show where he forms and participates with his former partner in comedy Greg Hemphil (Greg Hemphil).
The Duke has announced that the next nine season will be the last one, and Kirnans apparently plans his life after Kreiglanga (Craiglang).
According to official information, he is Director of the Aposicorn Limited.
The Actier refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source indicated that Kirnans was planning to become involved in the "extreme restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us!" -- Bolivia hopes that justice will open the way to the Kluso Ocean
The seamen are patrolling around you in the Fleets Stable Lap.
Public buildings are covered by ocean blue flags.
Fleet Baseships from Lake Titicaca, until the Amazon is flooded with nine: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
The memories of Chile in the 19th - century bloody conflict of the lost coastal line of resources are still alive in the drylands of Bolivia, just as long as it has been sailing back to the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is probably the highest for several decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice on 1 October following a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit and, of course, looks forward to a positive outcome," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla) said.
Many Buddhists will observe the International Court of Justice's judgement on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal is in favour of Bolivia's requirement that, after several decades, with the suspension of negotiations, Chile has the duty to discuss the granting of sovereignty to Bolivia by sea.
Bolivia's charismatic local President Evo Morales (Evo Morales), who is awaiting a contest for the election next year, is also very interested in the verdict of the day.
"We're close to getting back to Kluso's ocean," he felt like he was at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court’s judgment for the good of Bolivia is unlikely, and although it will be adopted, there are no major changes.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands is not empowered to grant the territory of Chile and its representatives have said that there will be no possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice has been adopted six months after its final examination shows that "no problem" has been identified by international legal expert Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And for the last four years, the case of Bolivia has not gone forward, but, on the other hand, has been delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the existing administration of Bolivia," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric has hidden the rest of the good wishes, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once again continue their negotiations, but it will be very difficult to hold the debate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged communications since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia, Håga, the former President, Edwardo Rodriges Velze (Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze), did not agree that the court's decision was unusually hasty.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "the opportunity to start a new summer relationship with Chile" and the possibility "to leave point 139 to long-term conflicts from which both parties will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales — another of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used maritime problems as political havens.
"Bolivia will never give up its rights to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to ask what to do in order to overcome the past."
North Korea will withdraw from nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho), said his people would never have eliminated their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments began when it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) was ready to resume outstanding diplomatic measures to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Chenun.
They claim that they are " Fantasies" to expect the US to continue to declare unprecedented sanctions and refusal to declare the end of the Korean war, any law for North Korea to travel on its way.
Washington is cautious as regards the approval declaration before Phenjana will take significant countermeasures.
Mr. Kims and President Donalds Tramps both want second season.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up a weapon that the State certainly considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to prepare for next Kim's trip with Tramp.
Paris fashions this is known with the latest massive main line on the way to you near High Street
If you want to increase your cell collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne (Thom Browne) introduced viewers with a series of absurd, big-to-head vulnerabilities in the 2019 spring/night season collection, which celebrated a set-up style background for the Paris fashion week.
The unprofessional bees have been exaggerated by Instagram this evening and these designers have sent their disturbing achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding dose was a colourless brown capor with similar colors as a small area that covered its head.
Massive accessorys were equipped with beads, beads, and even pineapples — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brauns also showed a magic mask — just before Heloin.
Many of the colorful masks were painted, and they were soon added to Hannibal Lekter, not to the high fashion.
One of the compositions reminded me of breathing thoughts, with pipes and glasses, while the other was similar to the sweetness of the man.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, it will take real time.
The style observers believe that large beads may be on your way to your nearest High Street.
The large-scale apples immediately became popular after the "La Bomba" appeared — the salmon apples with two feet (~60 cm) in wide range seems to have grown from Rianna to Emily Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkowski).
The status of cult objects in all social networks leads to another great donation to honey — the salmon puddle soda soma, almost as large as the model of pelagic pasta that carries it.
The total amount of iron refinery, processed with refinery bars and equipped with white leather belts, took the special place "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in the 2019 spring / summer season collection in the Paris Modes week.
Stylist of the celebration Luks Armitage (Luke Armitage) explained FEMAIL: "I hope that large amounts of silver and silver will appear in central trade routes in the coming summer, as the designer has left so much impact that it will be difficult to ignore demand for large-scale accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is important to citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a reputation for excellent education institutions and have maintained it in 2018 when excellent results were obtained on a regular basis, which further strengthens individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other public activities.
The aim of this school, which was attended by 30,000 pupils in Scotland and represented by the Scotish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to provide the best level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their farmers for further and higher education, their chosen career and their life as citizens of the world.
As a education sector that can develop and introduce special school programmes, we see that today’s languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak in the human language he understands, it keeps him in touch.
If you speak in his native language, it keeps him in his heart."
This is a reassuring reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain trust from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are found at the top of the league table with the largest number of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who were learning foreign languages reached the highest score A.
The data of the Independent Schools Board of Scotland on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest grades in Chinese A, and 72 percent also received those who received German, 69 percent who received French and 63 percent who received Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland will support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed in the future for children and young people.
Now languages as the subject of choice are evaluated in independent school programmes as high as those of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics group.
The 2014 survey of the British Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17 per cent of employers were unable to complete the holiday by reason of lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills become more and more mandatory to prepare young people for their careers in the future.
As the opportunities for work that will require knowledge of languages increase, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, they will benefit in the future from this long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages.
According to yourGov 2013 survey involving more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 per cent did not understand the foreign language well enough to hold negotiations, but the French language was the only language in which the number of people who spoke double numbers was 15 per cent.
That is why it is important for children today to learn their own language.
More languages, especially the national language skills of the developing countries, will provide children with a better job.
Schools in Scotland vary in language.
Some schools will focus more on modern languages, while others will learn other languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain in the future, in line with the plans by 2020.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be the experts in the area concerned.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and will provide them with the skills needed to achieve success in the future.
At present, in the global business environment, language is still vital for the future of a country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today’s languages would be regarded as "International Communication Skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It must be done well (It must be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland
Lebron's Debt in "Lakers" on Sunday Sandjego
Fans have finally been waiting for Lebrona's first game to take place in Los Angeles "Lakers".
Lük Volton (Luke Walton) has announced that James will play on the first season's opening game against Denver "Nuggets" Sandjego.
But it still has to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Voltons informed "Lakers" on the official website.
The "Lakers" reporter Mike Trudell (Maiks Trudels) wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
In the course of this week's practice, James asked about his plans for "Lakers" six pre-session games series.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trampa Mithina in West Virginia time, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramps is starting a series of mornings in Villing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trampla's plans for the next week, including a stop in the places of friendship, as well as in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice of a place to be completed by the Supreme Court has been suspended, the aim of the trampa is to obtain support for the upcoming interim elections, as it is at the risk that the Republicans will lose control of Congress after the vote in November.
What is going to happen today in West Virginia, and how will it be seen online?
Trampa Mittiņš in Villing, West Virginia is scheduled for seven evenings after the ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
In West Virginia you can watch online via YouTube channel.
It is believed that Tramps is talking about hearing this week in the case of Britta Kaveno of the Supreme Court candidate who has been charged with gender-crimes and is expected to vote in Senate to cancel the approval for a week while the FBI will conduct an investigation.
However, the main objective of this debate is to help improve the situation of the republics awaiting election in November.
President Trampa's campaign thus shows that the task of the next five minutes is "to activate volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they belong to the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to the Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for his work that the president will visit as much as possible because we are starting an active campaign season," said the representative of the trampa campaign who refused to reveal his name.
This evening, which is planned for "Wesbanco Arena" in Villing, may attract supporters from "Ohaijo and Pennsylvania, and reflect them in Pittsburgh media," says "Wesbanco Arena".
On the sixth day will be the second time during the last month when Tramps visited West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia candidate, who is in line with the findings.
"It's not a good sign to Morise that the President has to come in to help improve his results in the interview," according to Simon Haeder, professor of Western University Policy at the University of Virginia.
Raidera Cuuss 2018: The US has demonstrated its commitment to fight to maintain a great hope for Christmas for singles
After three sessions "in one word" on the third afternoon of the game "foursome" was likely exactly what was needed in this Raider case.
Sportsers love to talk about success fluctuations, and they really believe it, especially in such endeavors as these.
So, which side of them is success now?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, because I think it means in my own words that success has come to us," said Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth) in his own words.
Europe, of course, is a good thing because it is under way with 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
The ability made it clear that the Americans believe that the wind is coming in their mouths and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spita and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas) who played together all day, and each of them can be liked with three points of four.
The ability has been destroyed from the first site to the medicine and is an example of the winner.
As his circle continued, the gottaaches became more and more violent, making the decisive side of the bridge four times to achieve the same number of sides when he and Thomas were back on two sides after two.
His side in the battle that came his victory 15 was covered with a similar chain, of which he was convinced that the American team had not yet been fired.
"You really have to do deep work and worry about your pay," said Spit.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 pages for success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spices and Thomas is French Molinari (Franceco Molinari) and Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Castle.
The European fears, but the attractive couple remain behind four points and will not be harmed.
Molivud was the only couple who went out on the sixth afternoon of the week without getting drunk, but they also avoided being drunk on the sixth day of the morning, on the fifth day of the afternoon, and on the ninth day of the fifth day of the month.
This desire and the way in which their energy flows into this trajectory and back convinces them that they are players that must win on Sunday, and Flytwood and Molinari will be the most popular players who can guarantee potential European victory when the sun goes over "Le Golf National".
Love for both sides of the dispute at the same time.
However, the European triumphal talks were preliminary.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Web Simpson (Webb Simpson) were soon finished with this morning's fourballs in the form of Serhio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
The Bogie and two double front nine brought Spanish and Swedish cheese, and they were not even close to getting rid of it.
But no one will be able to help you to go to the end.
The games in the "fourball" and "foursome" forms are so exciting to watch closely because of too much interaction, to see what advice they give and what they do not, and how the strategy can change the situation in the first place.
Europe has been better played as a team so far, and before the last few days, it has been in a long run, but this competition in the form of "foursome" has shown that the US team is committed to fighting what many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
The European election of the Raider House is held on the last day 10-6
The European election on the last day of the Raider Cup will begin with a welcome leadership after the six-day "fourball" and "foursome" competition ended with 10-6 against the United States.
A couple of young Tommy Fleetwoods (Tommy Fleetwood) and Francesco Molinari (Francesco Molinari) were led by two powerful Tiger Woods (Tiger Woods), which increased the number of "Le Golf National" to four.
Tomas Bjorna (Thomas Bjorn) European team to maintain the trophies that had lost Haseltine two years ago dominated the U.S. team in the morning competitions in the form of fourballs, and the result of the series was 3-1.
The U.S. was more energetic in the form of foursomes, winning two matches, but it was unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Farika (Jim Furyk) team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 single games to keep the trophies.
Flytvod is the first European prime minister who received four points in line with Molinari, chosen for Moldova ("Mollivod") after the end of the sequential week, only two couples in the history of the Raider House, who received four points in the first four games.
In the form of "fourballs" of Woods and Patrick Reed, they followed the exciting game of the U.S. and Miss Deshambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with even more exciting results 57.4.
The wolf who won two games on the sixth day showed a great game for hours, but he has lost 19 of the 29 balls in the "fourballs" and "foursomes" formats, plus seven in the order.
Justin Rouzs (Justin Rose) retired before the "fourballs" tomorrow, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson (Henrik Stenson) "foursomes" to call Dustin Johnson (Dustin Johnson) and Brooks Keepka, who takes the first and second place on the world ranking.
Europe was unable to achieve its full success, although in the southern part of Paris, it was a pleasant and light summer.
The three-fold most prestigious golf competition winner, Jordans Spits and Justin Tomass, set the stage for Americans with two points on the sixth day.
They published 2&1 against the Spanish John Ram (John Rahm) and Ian Polter (Ian Poulter) "fourballs" and returned later to call Polter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after the loss of the first two pieces.
Only two times in the history of the Raider Castle, the team has played 4 points in a weakened game, but as owners, Farika (Furyk) team is sufficient only with an undistributed result to keep the trophies.
After two days in the second place, it seems that the anti-aggression on Sunday will be problematic.
North Korea announced that in "no" case, it would not fight alone without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea would not, in any case, abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "a significant step towards good will" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the detonation of nuclear testing and the promise never to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see a suitable response to the US," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never fight one another alone first."
Although Ri has reiterated well-known North Korea's movements of Washington's resistance to "progressive" access to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement left an impact because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenjana had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kima Čenuna and Donalda Trampa at the first session of the US President and North Korea's leader meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kims promised to work to achieve the "Denuclearization of the Korean side" while Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to officially end the Korean War between 1950 and 53, but the United States has announced that Phenjana must first be fired from its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not responded to the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The SV argues that "denuclearisation must be first", and increases the level of pressure created by sanctions to achieve the goals of power, even countering the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions might force us on the streets is empty fantasies that people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not talk about the intentions of the second Kima meeting with Trappa, which the US leader had specifically mentioned during the United Nations talk this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically raised three Kima meetings with South Korean leader Munu Jae-in during the last five months and added: "If the other side of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the US, the Korean side's denuclearization would not have reached that end."
However, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he announced in the UN General Assembly that the North Korean missile control on the U.S. continent was inevitable after Mr. Tramps had named Kim as a "rapist" suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Tramps, who had been threatening to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for her courage to take steps in the direction of disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done, and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
The third day, Tramps announced that he had not planned a particular time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should pay Phenjan for what he has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Mike Pompeo) told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with energy without allowing errors until the end and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has consistently reinforced sanctions since 2006, in an attempt to avoid funding for Fenjana's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo visited Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and was then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare for the second round.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He resigned from Phenjana in July, saying that progress has been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of "gangster's honorable requirements".
This month, the North Korea meeting with Munu committed to demilitarizing the arms policy and also the nuclear complex if the US will take "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that "relevant measures", which North Korea wanted to see, are security guarantees that Tramps promised Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will get a lesson on how to get enough rest
The new subject of education at Harvard University this year has come to the point that students sleep more, and this is an attempt to turn towards the ever more popular culture of brutalism, which includes a full study of caffeine overnights.
One provider found that the best university students in the world often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Čeisler (Charles Czeisler), professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a teaching subject that he believes is the first type of education in the United States.
The tendency to create a new subject of learning led him to feel the effects of a lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of a girl came to me and asked, "Why are you telling me this only now when I'm in the final course?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important it is to sleep — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year's first subject of education, provides students with basic information on how good sleep performance contributes to achievement in education and sport and improves overall well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University’s Health Services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course of education after learning that students suffer from serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly training process includes the interactive task series.
One of the parts contains a picture of the home door where students click on coffee bags, glasses, sports bags and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light and how it affects the performance of the sport’s lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping routine.
In other parts, students are informed of how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student's city map with interactive icons invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just like you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," added Professor Čeisler.
He said that a culture that flourishes with the ability to learn all night was still there, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep became a increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality of sleep must be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, anxiety and fear, and even to avoid weight gain, as the lack of sleep changes brains in the study mode by making them permanently exhausted.
Reimonds So (Raymond So), a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Čeisler develop a subject of study after he had attended one of the professor's lessons last year in Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject of education had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to all students.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who receive post-graduate education to obtain a similar programme before going to compete.
Professor Čeisler recommends that students set up a modator not only at the time they get up, but also when they're going to sleep, and also keep in mind how people damage "green light", which exposes the screen of electronic devices and LED lamps, because they can trigger daily rhythms by making it difficult to shut down.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga doors provided by Gerard men
"Rangers" visited another horrible game guests when Dollija Menga (Dolly Menga) was at the site of Steven Gerard (Steven Gerard's team's decision to lose 1 - 0 against "Livingston".
"Ibrox" team expected to win the first win from February 4:1 triumph "St Johnstone", but Gerija Holta (Gary Holt) team gave Gerardam his second losses in 18 games, since he became the club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader "Hearts".
Menga started the bomb seven minutes before the end of the half-hour, and the absence of Rangers' input was not considered after an attempt to balance the result.
"Rangers" will cover up to the sixth place, while "Livingston" will step up to the third floor, and in the middle of the gate, it's just "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" may be another problem, as the judge’s assistant, Kalum Spence, needed medical help because of headaches that were apparently caused by the next end of the loss.
Jérard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind the wall of "Ayr" by reaching the "Betfred" end of the box.
Holts, on the other hand, used the same 11 players "Livingston" that received "Hearts" one point last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-directed team pressed opponents in each episode.
It may have been that Rangers managed the bomb more often, but Livingston better used what he was doing.
They had to get their cards two minutes after the start of the Mengas first game sent Scott Pittman to Alana McGregor (Allan McGregor), but the central player gave his great opportunity.
Then the Keaghan Jacobs released Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in the protection of Alan Litgov (Alan Lithgov) was able to create a bomb only for long behind pillars.
"Rangers" took control, but there was a impression that the final third of the game is expected, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Moreloss (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly felt that he had to make a sentence in 15 minutes after he had met Stephen Loles (Steven Lawless), but Judge Stevens Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the Colombian call.
"Rangers" performed only two sites for the first half of the year, but the former "Ibrox" site of Liam Kelli (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed, not Lasana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibaly) site with head, not the satisfactory end of the attack of Ovi Edgar (Ovie Ejaria).
Although Livingston was probably beginning at 34 minutes, no one can deny that they had already benefited from their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer the end of Jacob's planned long combination.
Scott Erfield (Scott Arfield) did not respond when Declan Gallagher created the bomb Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson) which maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple end.
Jérard's stop was replaced by Rayna Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game, as the semi-sergeist sent a bomb Morolosam, but the impressive Kellis from his line to block immediately the year.
But "Livingston" continued to let the guests play how they like it, Litgova and Halket doing one end of the road after another.
The Holta team could have continued its leadership at the final stage, but McGregors played well while stationing Jacobobs before Litgovs took the lead in the show.
Glens Midlton (Glenn Middleton) was later replaced by "Rangers" in the game asked for another sentence, after he had dealt with Jacobobs, but Tomson's request was once again ignored.
Almanahs: Geiger's calculator
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanah: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... some day in Germany is born by Johannes Wilhelm "Hanss" Geigers, who grew up as a physicist.
Geigers developed a method of radioactivity identification and measurement as a result, finally, was a device known as Geiger's calculator.
The scientist who took his place and maintained Geiger has also taken his place in the pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado (Coronado calls), where the main players played an extremely unconfirmed role in the fight type, Rogers and Deils Evanss:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger calculator used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these holes, you will be able to hear how atoms work, which are released because of this mineral's radioactivity."
Evanss said, "That's really a bird!"
"Hanss" Geigers died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the destruction in his name continues to exist.
New vaccine against cancer can be taught by the immune system to "see" bad cells
New vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them.
During vaccine therapy, the immune system is learning to recognize bad cells
Using this method, cells of the immune system are obtained from the patient that are transformed into the laboratory.
Then they could "see" the protein that is characteristic of many harmful plants and will be injected back into the body.
The test vaccine shows multiple results in patients with various types of adverse tumours.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize bad cells experienced that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient's immune system cells by transforming them into their laboratory so that they can "inject" several tumours with Her2-like protein and then inject these cells back into the body.
In Bethesda, U.S. National Cancer Institute (US National Cancer Institute), Professor Jay Berzovski (Jay Berzofsky) of the United States said: "Our results show that we have a very diverse vaccine."
HER2 "Increasesing the growth of various types of harmful crops," including breast, ovarian, lung and kidney and right liver cancer, Professor Berzovskis explained.
A similar approach has been observed when immune cells from the patient 'emed up' have been affected by one type of leukaemia.
Kanje West after a visit to SNL, a fat man at MAGA Cepur, attacked the Critics of Trappa.
It won't work well.
Kanje West was selected in the "Saturday Night Live" study during this period following an independent presentation in which he praised US President Donald Tramp and announced that he would apply for the 2020 presidential election.
By the end of the day, the third song, called "Gosht Town", during which he played the "Make America Great" harps, he began to paint the voice phrases about democracies and again emphasized his support for Trappa.
"So many times when I spoke to white people, they asked, "How can you like Tramps? He's racist!"
Well, if I were attracted to racism, then I'd already met America," he said.
The "Saturday Night Live" began with a parade with the Metu Demon (Matt Damon) in which Hollywood star gave a witness to the British Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) in the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault.
Although it was not transferred, the material with the Vesta's horrors was introduced by comedy Chris Rock (Chris Rock).
It is not clear whether Rox tried to break the Vest.
Also, West lamented the spectators that they had been held responsible for his head injuries.
"They laughed at me in the back!
They said, "Don't go out there with their hats in the head!"
They laughed at me!
And they also said I lost contact with reality," said West, according to the Washington Examiner.
The vest continued: "Gribat to see what happens when the connection to reality is lost?" and promised to call "your Supermen's destiny," because it means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the audiences at least twice, but the members of this team looked together, and at least one person told the press issue: "The study had a complete hearing."
The last time I was invited to replace the singer Arianna Grande (Ariana Grande), who had lost a friend of Max Millers (Mac Miller) some days earlier.
The suit was packed with a sound (I Love it) that he performed in the champagne bottle.
Vesta supported the Conservative Group Leader of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most powerful people: PATEICOS, KA NECESSARY POLICY!"
But this interview leader Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West just "was what he was, and that's wonderful."
"But I will choose not to hire a person (to buy his music or clothing, or to support his "work), which, as I think, supports and agees with ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before this repertoire on Twitter announced that he has changed his name, saying that now he has become "a being that was previously known as Kanji Vest".
He's not the first artist who changes his name, and acts like Didy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Another repertoire of Snoop Dogg was formerly Snoop Lion, and, of course, a random music legend Prince, changed his name by symbol, but then to "the visual artist who was formerly known as Prince".
Indicted in an attempted rape attempt at a restaurant in Belfast

It is expected that the accused will appear before the Court of Justice of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Kits Herrington's "Tron Games" star turned against toxicity
Kits Herrington is known as John Snovs HBO's bloodthirsty midterm fantasy series "Tron's Games".
However, 31-year-old actor has turned against a brutal currency stereotype, claiming that such personal displays often lead young children to think they should be strong enough to be respected.
In the interview with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kits explained that she was thinking she was going to "have a problem", and asked the question of how to end up with toxicity in the #MeToo era.
Kits, who recently spoke with his "Tron Games" partner Rose Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31 years old, recognizes that this problem is important to him.
"I am now unable to think of what mistakes we have made with masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach new men about this problem when they grow up taking into account the current problem?"
Another believes that television with its very male personalities may be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity.
He continued: "What is born, but what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young children think they need to be treated as men?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time: How can we change this?
Because with the new men there are obviously problems."
In the interview he also recognizes that you will not be involved in any "Tron Games" continuation or event, after the series is over in the next summer, stressing that "the fields of war and horses have been destroyed".
Starting with November, Kits will play the main role of the renewed Sema Shepard "True West", who has been told about the film producer and his brother's hunter.
The actor recently admitted that he viewed his past with his wife Rose as the best thing that had happened to him as a result of the "Torn Games".
"I met my wife in this case, because it in its own words provided my family and my life from then on," he said.
Rosa Emmy's winning fantasy series played another character of John Snova's favorite Games.
In June 2018, the couple landed in the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% of the increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Healthcare officials report that there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of genital mutilation, which showed changes.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have been infected with HIV in this way has declined almost to zero, and the Chinese health officials were informed at the June conference in the province of June.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 since the year.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
In the light of national conservation values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually be exploited by women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are insufficiently protected by sexual consequences in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised general availability of HIV medicines as part of the measures to address the problem.
Maxina Votersa prohibits that the employee has distorted the data of the Republican senators, but has turned to "hazardous lies" and "reliance theories"
On the sixth day, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the claim that his staff member had published three U.S. Republican senators' personal information on the pages of Wikipedia's legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were spread by "super-good" media and Internet sites.
"Mile, honey and even more delicious honey," said Voters on his Twitter site.
The information is reported to include address and phone numbers belonging to the United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Africa, as well as Mike Lee and Orinam Hecham (Orrin Hatch) from Juta.
The information was posted online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, while a hearing in the Senate group on the charges of sexual misconduct against British Kaveno, appointed by the Supreme Court.
The eruption took place some time after the three senators had discovered Caveno.
Conservative, Internet sites such as "Getway Pundit" and "RedState" reported that the IP address identifying the entry is linked to the Voter's office and revealed information about Voter's staff, told Hills.
"This baseless claim is absolutely unfair and completely wrong!" said Voters.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by this false and false claim, is not in any way responsible for the spread of information.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely unfair and completely wrong!"
The Voter's statement soon prompted criticism online, including the criticism of our Secretary of the White Press, Ari Fleisher (Ari Fleisher).
"This is a ghost ban," Fleishers wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that his temperatures do not correspond to the Congressman.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, this person should not be bitter.
He shouldn't be a soldier.
He must not speak of the reasons for the complainant.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleisher's task was to compare Voter's reaction with the democratic cry of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of too much of a positive response during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro (Omar Navarro), a candidate for the Republican candidate to achieve Votersa's loss of her choice of color interpolation, also expressed her thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it matches the truth," he wrote.
In its communication Votersa informed that his office had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement authorities of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be recognized as legally responsible for all their works that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"John English 3" reference – a half-lived exhibition by Ronana Atkinson on pressure movies
It has become a practice to look for association with Brexita in each new film with the British flag, and it seems to be also about what has been revived, by Johnny English, a French comedy of experience that started in 2003 with "Johnie English" and with birds' rebirth in 2011 with "John English returns".
Is there any doubt about ourselves, how uncertain we are, about the possibility of a new export for our nation?
In any case, uncomprehensible John England with the eyes of the blind and unusually moving face has the right to create rivers after a second reviving — his name is more than any other indication that he is a wide range of Commissioners who are developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who, despite his insatiable claims on his enthusiasts, is a few Kluzo, a little Misters Bins, and the pressure of the boy who plays one of the "Chariots of Fire" theme at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, incomprehensible personality that Atkinson once painted now has already forgotten in Barclaycard TV advertisements where he left chaos on his way.
At least one or two beautiful moments are the latest experience of Johnny English.
I liked the place where John Engles goes to the helicopter's central deck in the armory, and the propeller's men are looking forward to his tail.
Akinson’s gifts are visually visible to create a commission impact, but humor is quite weak and strangely superior, especially because "real" cinema brands such as "007" and "impossible mission" are used with confidence by comedy as one of the ingredients.
Humor is impressed that it has been dedicated to children rather than adults, and I think that Johnny English's absurd writings are not as creative and objective as Atkinson's meme movie tricks in Bina's home.
As is usually the case, it is based on the fact that Britain has become a serious problem.
The cyberspace has been introduced into the UK super-secretary network by revealing the identity of British agents in all these areas as an undesirable active agent — a unfortunate role of small Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last match for the Prime Minister, the pomposa and the people of conflict who have already lost their full political popularity: Emma Tomsson is able to do what he can with Teresa Meja in part, but the scenario does not have much to work with.
His board members report that since all the active pressures have come to her attention, she will have to name someone who has already retired.
And this man is an disobedient John English who now works as a teacher in a small building institution, and he teaches students how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because England offers to get a job from the same base.
The English is returned to the Vaithol emergency meeting and is joined with his once-in-a-birth assistant Bo, who is also playing Bens Miller (Ben Miller).
Because now there is a man who has been betrayed by the commander of the water, the emotional staff that becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicky Pepperdine (Vicki Pepperdine) is not fully used.
And since Betmens and Robin's great mistake to be able to serve in His Highness Secret Service, she has returned and met with a beautiful beautiful loyal woman named Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko) named Ophelia Lodi (Ophelia Bulletinova).
As soon as the Prime Minister has been threatened by a charismatic technology billionaire, evil Jason Volta, by Jake Lacy (Jake Lacy), and he claims that he is able to solve the problems of British computers.
Angles and Bo start their wild fun dress: they're masked by officers, they burn a small French restaurant; they make a connection after entering the Volta luxury yacht; and England causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual realities on the head screen to meet the interior of the Volta building.
All possible end-of-life work is done, but as attractive as the film and the tape are, it has a lot of children's television.
A lot of measuring elements.
Like other Johnny English films, I can't wonder if the British film industry would not be able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Liberian Party prohibits plans for the British to work four days a week, but will be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) is preparing to discuss a radical plan that Britain is working on for four days a week, but will pay for five.
It is reported that the party wishes that business leaders, with the help of an artificial intellectual revolution, be given another exemption to workers.
In such a case, employees will be able to enjoy three days of the end of the week at the same time as before.
The sources say that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the good of the workers.
Over four working weeks have been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it to be an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic changes.
One of the top representatives of the Leiborst Party informed The Sunday Times: "It is expected that the changes will be reported by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but the four-day work week is an idea that is in line with the party's objective of measuring the economy for the good workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in the industry."
The Liberal Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party's four-day work week was promised to launch a general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Leiborist Party does not currently support this measure.
The representative of the Liberal Party reported: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and the party does not consider it."
Minister John McDonnell of the Athenian Cabinet used a liberarian conference last week to give his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonela explained that he has committed to withdrawing power from the "Director's mass" and public service companies "speculitors".
The Minister's plan also means that existing medium-sized shareholders in water companies may not recover all their packages because the liberarian government could implement the "recounter" due to the alleged injustice.
He also approved plans to include companies in government and to establish exclusive Property Fund (OHF) so that 10% of private sector company capital would be allocated to employees who would receive up to 500 tickets per year.
Lindsey Grems and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes" or FIB research in Kaveno case could change their views
The investigation by the FBI of a complaint against Judge Bret Kaveno (Bredt Kavanaugh) has suspended the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the office's findings could allow a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
On Wednesday, the event "60 Minutes" by Scott Pelley revealed to the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find out what would allow them to change their mind.
Kendei left a deeper impression of a person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, referring to the hearing procedure, I said I spoke to Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I said, "You did it?"
He was committed, direct and incomprehensible."
However, Grema's vote is evidently in stone.
"I have taken a decision about Bret Kaveno, and there will be a need for a serious complaint," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brets deliberately refused," said Grems, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think there are any changes to be expected."
What is the world’s citizens’ festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This sixth day will be held in New York, the World’s Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event involving an impressive number of stars, with the same impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World's Citizens' Festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will march in the Central Park in the Great Wall not only to enjoy the prizes, such as Janet Jackson, Repertoire Card B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes (Shown Mendes), but also to increase their understanding of the real goal of the event, which is the end of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a measure established by the Global Poverty Project, which aims to eradicate poverty by linking more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive free tickets for this measure (if it did not want to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "work", such as voluntary work, e-mailing a world leader, telephone calls or other important activities to promote understanding of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen movement been in achieving its goal for the rest of 12 years?
Is the idea of a free-of-charge concert a good way to convince people to act, or is there just one more case of "clickivism" when people seem to be able to really influence what they're doing by signing an online petition or by sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen Movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "work" from its supporters in an effort to achieve different objectives.
It reports that these activities have helped world leaders to report commitments and policies that are worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities for which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or financed.
The Group notes that the resources allocated so far have affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership between investors and implementing partners in the United Kingdom who have committed to "help children grow in full" to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end non-performing food in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from citizens around the world.
"With the Government of the United Kingdom, the sponsors, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world like you, we can leave an invaluable history of social injustice in the history of food," she said in her April 2018 London concert "The Power of Nutrition" by the representative of Tracy Ulmena (Tracey Ulman).
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 measures had been launched, calling on the Government of the United Kingdom to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the Government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long journey in which we will fall and suffer failure.
However, just as it has achieved great civil rights and anti-partite movements in front of us, we will be making progress, as together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendess (Shown Mendes), Cardi B, Jeanella Monée (Janelle Monée) are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, which will lead Deborah-Lí Fernes (Debora-Lee Furness) and Hugh Jackman (Hugh Jackman).
The U.S. could use the war fleet "blockade" to stop Russian energy exports – the Minister of Interior
"If necessary" Washington can use its war fleet to stop Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, – said US Interior Minister Rainens Zinke (Ryan Zinke), as it is called "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activity in Syria — especially where it operates under the call from the legal government — is an access to new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to deliver energy just as it does in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer's opinion, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can prepare to open the sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke referred to the public who had come to visit the measure taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation called the "Energy Consumer's Voice" U.S.
He compared Washington's approach to the solution to the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually equal.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent only on fossil fuels.
Further allegations are that the Trampa administration promotes the export of frozen natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia — a number of cheaper options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, trampa administration officials and U.S. President Donald Tramps are also trying to convince Germany of the "unappropriate" North Stream 2" gas pipeline project that would make Berlin "independent" from Moscow in the name of trampa.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline worth $11 billion in US dollars, which would double the current gas pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin considers that the Vashington fire-fighting project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of making pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Minister Aleksandr Novaks of Russia after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Minister of Energy Riku Periju.
The US has voiced its negative position against Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The German leading industry organisation — the German Industrial Federation (BDI) — has called on the US to refrain from taking part in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a big problem if a third country were to enter into our energy supply," he said after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI), Mr Kemps.
Senator Elizabeth Vorena will give serious consideration to her candidate for the 2020 presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Vorena announced that he would seriously consider applying for the president's office after the mid-term elections.
At the meeting of the Council in Holioca, Masačüsets, Vorena confirmed that she was considering the presidential election.
"The real time for women in Washington to have "salabos" by the imperfect government, which also means women-presidents," she reflected her words in The Hill newspaper.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidate's election as President of the United States."
At the Council's meeting, Vorena referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he "led this country in the wrong direction".
"I am troubled by what Donald Tramps is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has been publicly criticised by Tramp and her High Court candidate, Bret Kaveno.
On Friday’s Twitter report, Vorena said: “Of course, it is necessary to investigate the FIB before the elections.”
However, the fourth day of the consultation published revealed that most Vorenas' supporters did not consider that they should apply for the 2020 elections.
According to the study results of the Boston Globe political research centre of the University of Sufolas, 85 percent of the "probably" voters in Masačúsets claimed that the senator should not apply for the election.
Thirty-two per cent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey revealed that the former Governor Devals Patricks had received more support, receiving 38 per cent of candidates and 48 per cent against.
With regard to possible candidates for the 2020 elections, the names of the members of the High Profile of the Democratic Party, such as former Vice-President Joe Baidens and Senator Bérnijs Sanders, will appear.
The news agency "Associated Press" informed Baidens that he had made an official decision by January.
Sára Peilina in the other side of the Treka Peilina PTSS Donalda Trappa
Treks Peilins (26) spent the year in Iraq after his arrest in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on the night before.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through after his return, I can refer to other families dealing with the consequences of PTSS and a certain dose of hostility that our soldiers return with," she said to the public at Donalda Trampa in the meantime in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilina called her arrest "the obvious problem that all of us cannot see" and said about her son and other veterans that "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back under pressure, they're wondering whether they're worth what their fellow warriors and pilots and all the other military partners have given to this country."
According to the representative of the Vasilla Police Department, Dana Beneta was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with violence against women and the possession of weapons in a state of emergency.
18 countries, Colombia's area challenges for new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Colombian region support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing from the gang or the family of violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the Colombian region presented a brief statement to the court in Washington on Friday to support the asylum seeker who has faced the obstacles posed by that policy, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Session, which was launched by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and her violent gang member" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers who supported Greece characterised Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which came from the US asylum seeker as countries where the problem was widespread in the family.
The new asylum policy of the United States changed the 2014 decision of the Imigrant Appeal Council which allowed immigrants who had fled the violence family to ask for asylum without documents.
On Friday, the Colombian District Attorney General Karl Racín announced that the new policy " ignores national, federal and international laws introduced by decades".
"The Federal Law provides that all requests for asylum are examined in accordance with the facts and conditions of the request and that such a breach violates this principle," was stated in a brief statement by the Court Council.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants would probably become entrepreneurs and "insurance of the required labour force".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Seşons (Jeff Sessions) turned to immigration judges, asking them not to grant asylum to victims who fled from the family of violence and gangs.
"Affliction is available to people who suffer because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political perspective," Seshons said in his communication on politics on 11 June.
It has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
Successful rescue efforts by Palu, due to the number being doubled in the alive search process
The situation of survivors has become increasingly worse.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Ríza Kusuma, calming down her smoking baby at the city's evacuation center in Palu.
"In minutes the fast medical assistance service will introduce new victims.
The pure water is fictitious."
The people were seen returning home to their destroyed houses and moving away from their possessions in the water, trying to save everything that was available.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients suffering from severe earthquakes of 7.5 magnitudes were filled.
Some of the infected, including the Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had been beaten with mugurkaul and plecs, slept outside Palu military hospitals where patients were treated outside because of an unmitigated post-greed.
Her eyes were filled with tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the number of hotels in the fifth state where she and her wife were found.
"There was no time to save.
It seems I was forced into the walls," the news agency "Associated Press" said Haris, noting that his family had entered the city for the purposes of chaos.
"My heart calls my wife for help, but then the hearing began.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of attempting to contain China by advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came to the audience with four-page advertising, every day highlighting the mutual benefits of the US and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused the use of the Beijing American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donalds Tramps referred last Wednesday to the annex paid by "China Daily" in the most selling newspaper "Des Moines Register", accusing China of attempting to interfere with the US Congress's wish on 6 November, but China refuses to do so.
The defendant's complaint that Pekina was trying to interfere with the US elections marked what U.S. officials told the agency Reuters that it was a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is quite normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, as a result they apply a range of tariffs to imports of each other.
At the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in countries such as Iao, which supported the Trapa Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terís Branstads, Ambassador of the United States in China and former long-term Governor of Ioo, who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstads wrote his opinion on the Sunday edition "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this fear by putting advertising advertising on our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the tradition of freedom of speech and free press for America so importantly, by inserting a paid commercial "Des Moines Register," Branstads wrote.
"In contrast, here in the ordinary Beijing news cinema you will find a limited number of different views and you will not see such different real reflections of the fact that the people of China may be concerned about the economic traction of China, taking into account that media are here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese magazines refused to publish" his letter, but he did not mention what it was.
Analysts warn about Republicans who awaken women's candidates from midterm elections involving the Kaveno scandal
Since many leading republics support and protect the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno (Brett Kavanaugh), against which several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that the upcoming mid-term elections will have a negative response, especially from women.
The emotions involved have been extremely high, and it is evident that most Republicans have already been ready to vote.
Such cases cannot be cited as "The Hill" in the newspaper "The Sixth Day" by Professor of Science at the University of Siraqúza Maksvela University of Maxwella School of Policy, Grant Reehers.
Ríhers doubted that the recent encouragement of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) to conduct the FIB investigation would be a very great reason to discourage the spirit of the voters.
"The women will not forget what happened last night. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," she said on Friday, according to the newspaper "Washington, D.C." Karine Jean-Pierre, former councillor and national representative, said.
On Friday morning, protestors in front of the Senate demonstratively called "November" when the Republicans, who were in contact with the Committee of the Judges, chose to continue with the opening of the Caveno candidature of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already high-level, that's right.
However, it could be even higher, especially between the citizens of the country's most influential voters and the latest voters (ages 18 to 29 years old), who often do not vote even if the President does not like them."
Even before Forda's public testimony in which she had filed allegations of sexual violence by the High Court's candidate, she analysed my potential failure if the Republicans continued to issue this petition.
"This Republican party has become a sensitive chaos," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republic, at the beginning of last week's NBC News.
"This is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kaveno will be judged, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have stood against it," said the news channel, Guy Sesil (Guy Cecil), Director of the United States, who is leading this group to choose democracy.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided over those who believe in Forda and Kaveno's testimony, a little more tending to believe in the last.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents have a certain or the most difficult time to believe in Forda's testimony, while 35 percent claim that they have a certain or the most difficult time to believe in Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that Kaveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Fordu.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently conducting an investigation on the allegations made by Forda after the Fleka campaign, as well as on at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda was a witness to the Senate Justice Committee that Kaveno was a 17-year-old victim of sexual assault.
Ramirez argues that during his studies in Jill in 1980, the Supreme Court’s candidate has shown her her generality in a ballet.
Global website developer plans to start a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tims Börners-Lī (Tim Berners-Lee), the founder of the global network, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest Inrupt project of the Technology Legend is a company based on the Open Childersa-Li platform "Solid".
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Children's-Lij argued that the secret intention of Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The user uses "Solid" technology so that people can create their own "personal online data store" or PTD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available at the same time in one view.
The personal online database is unique because only the user determines what and what type of information can be accessed.
The company referred to it as "personal powers using data".
According to the company's manager, John Bruce, the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make solid available to everyone.
The company is currently working on the safety platform purchased by Börners-Lí, Brass, IBM, some foreign manufacturers agreed to work on the project and a voluntary coder community.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using Inrupt online tools.
Children's-Li said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, completely turning all their business models into one night.
"We don't ask for his permission."
In its publication "Midium" on Saturday, Children's-Lij stated that "Inrupt" "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the new integrity and quality of the network created by the solid base".
In 1994, Bérners-Lí transformed the Internet into a Global Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Children's-Lij has had an impact on their views on network neutrality.
Even after Inrupt launch, Children's-Lī will remain the Global Network Consortium, the Global Network Fund and the Founder and Director of the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new online era," said Börners-Lí.
Bernard Vens (Bernard Vann): Marking the Victoria Cross granted to the driver during World War I
For 100 years in his hometown, an event is celebrated when the only champion of the Church of England received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior.
The honourable Member Bernard Vens received this statement on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglish and Lehaukarti.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he also did not know of the British Supreme Military Appeal.
On Saturday's case in Rošden, Northamptonshire, his two little pieces of memory were revealed to him.
One of his nephews Michael Vens (Michael Vann) said that it was "very symbolic" that such a stone was discovered 100 years after his father had received a significant statement.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vens led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin "by very often the great fires of the mill and the large
Later he stepped up to the shooting line and, with the greatest certainty, led this line forward before the introduction of a large-scale zone, where he made three groups.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Vena — just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Vens (72) said that his father's action was "something I could never do and that is also very humble action".
He, along with his brother Dr. James Vann (Dr. James Vann), also died under the command of the Brittwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens claimed that his feelings were "appreciated by taking part in this debt", and noted that "the real value of the value of the money is evidenced by the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206, but instead waited for Cuzinji Pepu
Imagine that you've been sitting up all night to see "Bellator 206, but at the end you've been looking at this main event.
In Sanhos, 13 matches were included, including six main cards, which were broadcast on the radio all night in UK channel 5.
At 6 p.m. when Gegards Musasi (Gegard Mousasi) and Rory MacDonald (Rory MacDonald) were preparing to stand up against each other, visitors in the United Kingdom were reluctantly surprised by the change in the movement to Cúcinji Pepa.
Some were in real ignorance when all night until early morning they were in a state of shock waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the change of transmission to children's film as a "failurey douche".
"The government has established that the content of this type is not acceptable after 6.00 p.m., so there has been a transfer to the children's programme," Devis Švarcs (Dave Schwartz), the former vice-president on marketing and communication issues, explained.
"Dear Pepa," "Yes."
The president of the company "Bellator" Skott Kokers (Scott Cooker) said he was working on graph planning to allow further viewers in the United Kingdom to see these transfers.
"When we think about recasting the transmission, I think we can sort it out," Koker said.
"But the clock is there from six in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and tomorrow after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, after the transfer, many texts were shown, and they were not positive.
We tried to avoid it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was controlled by the government.
I can assure you that there will never be such a problem.
We're going to keep up with five wars, not six (as it has been until now), but we're trying to convince the fans, but we're going to make an effort.
It's a failed situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Toms Deilijs didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to make progress.
Twenty-four-year-old man didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he started visiting high school.
According to the first Radio 4, Desert Island Discs, led by Lorena Laverne (Lauren Laverne), he said he started talking about homosexual rights in order to give others "the truth".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has been given several months of restlessness.
Showing as a result of the first Levernes programme, Delijs said that raising awareness of "better" than others is not accepted in society as it can be enjoyed by both girls and children.
He said, "Even today I feel that I'm not as good as others or that I'm different, has been the main engine that gave me strength and endurance to achieve success."
He said you wanted to prove that there was "something" in order not to let people wish that they would finally know about his sexuality.
The second Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-level LGBT campaign leader and has used his appearance in this year's Friendship Games in Australia, calling on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that we decided to talk to society because we felt happy that they were able to live openly and without difficulties and wanted to give the truth to others.
The three-fold World Championship said that in a man of love, the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, "has become unskilled".
Délijs spoke of the 20 years old Oskar’s prize lottery last year and claimed that the age gap was never an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so many of us" (his first Olympic games were 14 years old, and his father died three years later from cancer), it's hard to find any of your age who would have experienced similar screams and screams.
He became the father's son, Robert Reys Blacks-Deilij (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Deilij claimed that his "all perspectives" had changed.
"A year ago everything that was important to me was getting gold medal," he said.
"You know what? Life is more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert is the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Delijs said that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he had to do with his father was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games he wanted to find in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him she wouldn't be there any more to find in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not incapacitable," he said.
In the following year, Deilij took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – entering houses in front of the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of music — Heather Small performed "Proud", which reasoned with him on his way to the achievements of the Olympic Games and still uplifted zoos.
The "Desert Island Discs" program is held at BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 p.m. after the British summer.
From the shape of Mikelson's reserve in the six-day game of the Raider Castle
American Phil Mikelson (Phil Mikkelson) will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47th. Raider's game games, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid an unsuccessful event.
Mikelson, who has already taken part 12 times every two years in the campaign, met Captain James Furiks (Jim Furyk) on the 6th day of the reserve for four children and two couples.
Instead of finding out at the centre of activity as often as it has been in relation to US teams, the fifth winner divided his day by working as a supporter and by participating in his game with the hope of improving what he learns.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most precise player in his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the controversial Le Golf National fight in an uneven field where he is regularly punished by the wrong side.
And, if the game itself isn't scary enough, Michaelson will fight in the ninth floor of the 9th floor with the exact British winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with young Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are left with four points, starting 12 single-game games, successfully run, Mikelson's balls could be of decisive importance.
Furiks without words expressed confidence in his teammate.
"He fully recognized his role today, invited me for a mule, applied his hand to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He's very convinced of himself.
He's a great sportsman who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've ever had a picture of her playing two games.
I drew more, but everyone threatened what they were doing, and we'll figure it out.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will record Nika Faldo (Nick Faldo) on the most played cats on Sunday at the top of the Raider Castle.
This could mark the end of the race career of the Raider Castle, which it has never really met with its individual record heights.
Mikelson has won 18 winnings, experienced 20 losses and seven undistributed games, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some of the benefits of non-materiality.
"He's fun, red and smart, he likes to get excited about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the latest players also liked to watch them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just a game."
European electoral captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that a significant turnout can soon be revealed
European electoral captain Thomas Bjorns from experience knows that in the course of a significant turnout in the fight for the Raider Cup in the last few days, it can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis argued at the 1997 game in Valderra, where the enemy team, which was the captain of the Sívs Baljesteros (Seven Ballesteros), won five points of excess over the Americans, but only now came on the final line with a very small point of excess, i.e. winning with 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You will continue to remember that we were very much in charge of Valderra; we were in charge of Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderra where we won but only with little excess," said Bjorns (in the picture), concluding the victory of the 2018 Explosive Group with 5-3 both Friday and evening, running with 10-6 golf field "Le Golf National.
So the story will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is done.
Tomorrow you'll give yourself everything.
Go to the field and show your best food!
This will not end until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to get this trophy, and we will also concentrate on it.
I've always said that I focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we'll know very well what's going on on the other hand against us -- the world's top players."
Easy on what his golfers had shown for their performance in the field, Bjorns remarked: "I've never agreed on age.
Tomorrow is waiting for new challenges.
The sun is for individual games, and it's quite another thing.
It is great if at the moment when all the rhythm is good, you are a partner with you, but in individual games your golfer skills are fully checked.
This message must be delivered to your players, i.e. to give them everything in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and you must also give him your best supply."
Unlike Bjorn's opponent team captain Jim Furiks, his players will strive to show their best performance directly in individual non-partner games. The exception is Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth) and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who obtained three points from four.
The same Furiks has won both these important last days tournaments — both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and then as a result of the European team's having a significant success, which later became known as "Miracle at Medinah".
"Atceros per written word," he said in response to the fact that Bens Krenšo (Ben Crenshaw), commander of the 1999 team, joined his players in the final day's battle.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the quick show that you lived in Brooklyn, where you lived in Medin.
When such an impulse is created in a single direction, it causes great pressure for middle-possible games.
We created our composition and compared the boys in a way that we were right. We're trying to make some noise tomorrow."
Tomasam had been commissioned to try to lead a counter-attack, and he founded Rory McIllroy for the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rame (John Rahm), Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood) and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in the first part of the list.
"I met boys in this sequence because I think it's best in the course of the tournament," Bjorns said with regard to the selected players.
Return of Germany's new caricature in operation
Germany’s latest fleet had to be deployed in 2014, thus replacing the age-old Autumn wartime flags, but it will not occur until the next year due to the wrong system and increasing costs, local media reported.
The transfer of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" of Baden-Wirtemberg's cargo class is now suspended until the first half of 2019, reported in the newspaper "Die Zeit", citing military field representatives.
The ship had to join the Car fleet in 2014, but the unfavourable supply problem had an impact on the bulk of the project.
The four Bádenes-Virtemberge ships commissioned by the Caraflot in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen class frigates.
It is expected that it will be equipped with powerful bulkheads, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipment rockets, as well as some mysterious technologies such as reducing the coverage of radio, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer periods of maintenance — it should be possible to place new frigates up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the latest technology cars, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in the overseas countries, are already ageing until the time of its entry into operation, notes "Die Zeit".
The failed frigate F125 last year was manned by all the headlines when the German Caraflot officially refused to transfer ships into operation and sent them back to the ship builder "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship's car fleet returned to its construction site.
It was little known about the reasons for such a step, but the German media mentioned several significant "programme and equipment defects" which would make the charges invalid if used in the war mission.
The lack of programming was a particularly important factor since the Baden-Virtemberg class ships were operating around 120 seafarers, which is only half of the old Bremen class's freight crew.
It was also shown that the ship has too much weight to reduce its performance and limit its ability to make improvements in the future.
It is considered that 7000 tonnes of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as severe as similar ships used by Germany during World War II.
Similarly, the costs of the entire project (including the training of staff) have also become a major problem for the wrong device.
It is said that its costs have reached EUR 3.1 billion in the original amount of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems related to new fleets become particularly important, given the recent warning that the German maritime forces are low.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Pierters Bartels (Hans-Peter Bartels), the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the caraflot really "starts to break the vessel's use".
Amateur claimed that this problem had been substantially resolved over time, since old ships were removed from operation but were not delivered in place of new ones.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Virtemberg class had joined the Caraflot.
"National Trust" listened to the life of secret sex
A new study carried out in a high-level Scotland has been aimed at discovering how syllables are used in the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help protect them in the future.
Scotia National Trust scientists in the Inverves garden will study pundurs, pygmies, as well as bronchos and water in the garden of Inverevas.
In the main areas, special registries will be set up to monitor the activities of competition throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts will analyse all entries to determine the frequency of cross-sectional connections and the types of specific operations.
A biotopic map and a report will then be drawn up to establish a detailed view of the species in which the behaviour of the monkeys is reflected.
The NTS Nature Protection Council Rob Devars (Rob Dewar) hopes that the results will be found which biotopes are the most important and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of biofuel management activities such as the establishment of rivers and the best way to preserve forests for wildlife and other related species.
During the past century, there have been considerable disturbances in the sex race in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
These lands are threatened by construction and development work that is related to the loss of safe havens and habitats.
Wind generators and lighting can also create risks, such as muscle paper and some construction materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, they're not blind.
However, because of the effects of their fatty milk, their hearing during the dry season is more useful than the eyes.
They use a complex method of determining the location of the aid to find holes and obstacles in their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is seriously concerned with the problem of cyberspace.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, audits of cyberspace secrets and sometimes even rescue works.
The organisation has even been established in Scotland for the first and only specifically reserved "Threave" in Dhamfria and Galove, where eight of the species present in Scotland are mixed.
Special Manager David Thompsons (David Thompson) claims that this territory is ideally suited for the race.
"Here's a great place for the six-year-olds," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a biotopes in general.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about homosexuals, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He points out that it is important to check that prior to carrying out property maintenance work, there are non-movable pests in the area concerned, as it may be possible that one mother’s secrets are killed by an unknown destruction of up to 400 mothers and their minors, so that it is possible to destroy all the local population.
Birds are protected and must not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed by their secretaries.
Elizabeth Ferrella (Elisabeth Ferrell) has called on the company to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about monkeys, and we just don't know how they are."
Ronaldo refuses to defend the case by ordering lawyers to appeal to the court of Germany's newspaper
Christian Ronaldo (Cristiano Ronaldo) has been condemned to avoid his targeted accusations as "bad news", claiming that people "want to focus their attention" by using his name.
Her lawyers are ordered to appeal to the court for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese origin and the youth football game in Turin are accused of being defeated by the American Cathryn Mayorga in a 2009 hotel number in Las Vegas.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to listen to this incident, she sent her "Der Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after these allegations were made, Ronalda, 33 with Instagram online video interface, approached his 142 million followers, calling this information "bad news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is false news," the five-year-old "Ballon d'Or" spoke in the room.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous for my name's account, it's part of my work.
I am a happy person, and everything is good," smiling the added player.
According to the information provided by Reuters, Ronaldu lawyers are prepared to appeal to the court of Deer Spiegel for the allegations they have cited as "unacceptable information in the field of suspects' privacy".
Lawyer Christian Scherttz said that the player will demand compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the infringement which may be one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the "Palms Hotel and Casino" class in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted by the Court of Nevadas State of Clarkes in the District of Nevada, it is reported that after meeting the night club, Ronald and Majorga returned to the player's hotel number where he was still defeated by a woman.
Majorga claims that following that incident, Ronald's criticism was on the way and said there was "99% "good boy", but he was critical of this "one percent" card.
In accordance with the information contained in the document, Ronaldu confirmed that there was sex in excess, but this occurred after mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she had been taken to the police and had been taken to the hospital by the trauma photograph, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "warning from the apartheid" and worried about "public degradation".
At 34 years of age, the woman claims that she no longer wants to accept the terms of this contract because the incident has left the trauma remaining.
At the time these claims were made, Ronaldo wanted to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this evening he passed 100 million euros to the Italian "Young".
Brexite: loss of manufacturers of the United Kingdom "over all the time regrettably"
"The United Kingdom "will regret it all the time" if after Brexita it loses its world leader position in the production of cars," said business secretary Greg Clark.
They're concerned about the fact that Toyota UK has announced "BBC" that, if Britain were to show off the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston industry in Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese exporting producer said that the delay at the border with Brexita could be placed at the workplace without agreement.
Burnaston factory, which produces "Toyota" models "Auris" and "Avenis", produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our industry will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston Marvin.
Other UK producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have decided to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, "BMW" claims that after Brexita per month will close its mini factory in Oxford.
According to the exporting producers, the main concerns are the risk chain of supply if no agreement has been reached after Brexita.
The Toyota production line shall operate in accordance with the principle of "excessive time" where cars manufactured after the order are required to be part of both the United Kingdom and the EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the EU on 29 March without agreement, there may be obstacles that could lead to some delays and failures.
After "Toyota" said by the company, it would not be possible to stop more than one day's valuable inventory in its Derbyshire industry, so it would be possible to stop production.
Mr Clarke said that the next EU relations plan (Chequers) developed by Teresa May is "expected precisely to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that would allow, as I say, not only to benefit at the present time but also to use this option," he said "BBC" in Radio 4 programme "Today".
"The proof of it is not only from Toyota, but also from other producers that we must be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
"Toyota" could not state how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term increased costs would reduce industry's competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris (Peter Tsouvallaris), who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and working as the Union's co-ordinator, said that his associates feel increasingly confused: "From experience I can say that as soon as an agent dies, it doesn't come back."
The representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The trampa meeting with Rozenstein can be resumed, reports the Baltic home
Donald Trampa's important meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rozenstein (Rod Rosenstein) can be "repatriated for another week" because the struggle with the President of the Supreme Court's Office will continue with Britta Caveno, which he reported on Sunday at the White House.
Rozensteins monitored the involvement of Special Adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who examined Russia's election, the link between the funds used by the Trapa and Russia, and the possible non-compliance with the justice of the President.
For several months, it has been debated in Washington whether Tramps will reject the deputy of the Attorney-General and will therefore threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times reported that Rosensteins has discussed entering into negotiations with Trappa and the possibility of renouncing the President by Amendment 25.
Rozensteins denied this information.
But the next morning, he went to the White House, where he was convinced that he had resigned.
It was reported on Thursday's event with Trappa, which was currently in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said that "best" did not release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended to avoid confrontation with the Senate's hearing committee, in which both Kaveno and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct were Dr. Kristine Bleijja Forda.
On Friday, Tramps asked the FIB to conduct a long week's investigation into the charges made by Caveno, continuing to delay the Senate's vote.
Trampa Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (Sarah Sanders) visited Fox News Sunday.
The news about Rozenstein in the past she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or another week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we will see it, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not released our press from the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of librarians was not linked to the dislike of the TV reporter "fare cars," although she added, "I don't believe they're famous cars."
He then proposed direct contact between Trappa as a result of increased press interest.
"The President attended more questions and answers than any president had before him," she said and, without further information, said, "We have been interested in the number."
Sandersa said that the exemptions would still take place, but if the press would be able to ask the President of the United States questions uninterruptedly, this is certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot, and you see we've done it a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to happen at the press station when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps regularly answers questions from the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences that are visited by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The President may have demonstrated his reasons this week in New York, focusing on the efforts of the reporters to address uncontrollable and short-term fears.
A letter from the Minister of Health to the EU employees of Scotland NHS on threats related to Brexite
The Minister of Health has written a list of EU staff working in the Scotland National Health Service (NHS) to express appreciation and to choose a stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the fall of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to meet the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freemena wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during the world which led to the expected decisions this morning.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom is also preparing a possible scenario if no agreement was reached.
I know this is a very unpleasant time for you.
So I would once again like to stress how much I appreciated the involvement of each employee regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from both the EU and outside provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit our care to our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want to stay here."
A surprise surgery for Christian Abercrombie is performed after a major trauma
Christian Abercrombie was performed by the Tigers State for the protection of Christian Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) after his death on the sixth day, which resulted in the arrest of Vanderbilt Commodores, reported by the "Tennessean" sports reporter Mike Organs (Mike Organ).
The chief coach of the state team in Tennessee told the reporters that the trauma had taken place shortly before the half-hour.
"He got to the side line and it's called a noise," said Ryde.
As Abercrombies were found on the side lines, trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen, he placed it on the knees and delivered it for further research.
A state official in Tennessee reported that Abercrombies had been exploited at the centre of Vanderbiltas University's medical center.
Haris adds that in the meantime "there is no information about the type of trauma/smoothity", and the state team in Tennessee is trying to understand where this trauma is at the moment.
Abercrombies, a red Creak representative, is in his first season following the replacement of Ilonius against the state team in Tennessee.
Before the start of the sixth day of the game, he had made five blockades, which were set up in this season as a total of 18
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher government tax by buying property in the United Kingdom
A higher national tax will apply to foreign buyers when purchasing property in the United Kingdom and the additional equipment obtained will be used to help the homeless in accordance with the new "Tory" plan.
This step will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national case provides that up to 120 million trucks can be collected per year to be sent to the homeless.
A higher national tax will apply to foreign buyers by buying property in the United Kingdom and by forwarding the additional aid to the homeless, it will today notify Terez Meja.
This step is considered to be an attempt to neutralise the efforts of Jeremy Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) to attract new voters with promises to ensure housing at the most cost and to discuss the most sustainable part of society.
The increased national tax will apply to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money received, to open up government efforts to address the problem of homeless people.
The contribution included in the current national tax, including the application of a higher level of fees for the purchase and purchase of another premises two years ago, could be three per cent.
The National Fund provides that such steps can be supplemented by its budget up to 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thus taking prices and making it difficult for the first purchasers to go home.
Many of the wealthy state territories, especially the capital city, have become "spok cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers, most of which spend their time abroad.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in government tax so that more new people could be allowed to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high-performance property prices on the ground, but not using them, and encouraged Ms. Maya to withdraw from the quotas for the houses accepted for price in order to address the British housing problem.
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of attractive house reform, including a reform on rental control and leaving the house for no reason.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to the construction of new houses.
Ms. Mejas said: "I have said last year that I will use my Prime Minister's office to restore the dream of Britain — that is, every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means the setting up of our embedded housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and organize their lives.
However, it is not right that houses can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, which are heavily working in Britain.
Many dream about their home has become too far away, and the problem of homeless people is still current."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run "Scotland"
"Sunderland" leader Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is to become a "Scotland" leader at some point.
Skots, 42 has taken up the challenge of renewing the North East Club, which is currently occupying third place in the first contract with three points above.
He moved to St. Mirren's Stadium after his return to Scotland last spring.
"As a player I wanted to play my country.
I got a B box, and it was all," Scotland's "BC" to the "Sportsound" broadcast said Ross.
"But I used to go with my father to watch "Scotland" games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, this opportunity would only be shown if I were successful in leading the club."
Rosa's head of the "Sunderland" club is Dick Advocate, David Moyes (David Moyes), Sam Allardis (Sam Allardice), Martin O'Neill (Martin O'Neill), Roy Küns (Roy Keane), Guss Boyets (Gus Poyet) and Paulo Di Kanio (Paul Di Canio).
The former president of "Alloa Athletic" claimed that he did not have a crush following such a large club's recognised leaders at the end of the day, before rejecting the offers made by Barnslia and Ipsviča.
"My achievements will now be assessed after whether I can return this club to premier.
This club's structure and opportunity undoubtedly makes it premier," he said.
"Turning back to the club's premier will not be an easy task, but I'll probably think I'll be here only when this task is done."
Ross is only in his third year of career, working as Deputy Director in Dumbarton for a period of 15 months in the "Hearts" trainer.
Then he helped the club "Alloa" get back from the third grade and in the same season helped St. Mirren get the title of the championship.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable now than during his career at the club "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"These are probably real cross-cells," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa".
"I really believed that leadership was my real call – much more suitable than playing.
I heard voices because I benefited from the good results I could have from living and enjoying certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I would still feel it because of the stress and pressure associated with work, but my leadership is my trust.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it. It's like I'm in the right place, I don't feel so good all my life."
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Saturday 30 September from 12 a.m. to 1 p.m. after the British summer.
The survey revealed that the most appropriate time for the enjoyment of paint is at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The summer’s heat wave has allowed Britain’s less popular neighborhoods to collapse, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data collected revealed that in July the volume of beef and veal sales increased by 2.7 per cent but decreased by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a representative of the business consultancy agency CGA, who collected data, said: "The continuous sun-time and long-term participation of the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the gain of the circle increased by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurants experienced a crisis.
Restaurants whose sales decreased by 1.8 per cent in June experienced a more severe situation in July.
The situation at the vineyards and bars was more favorable because they experienced much higher temperatures than the restaurants experienced the rain.
Also, food-based dishes are tied from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant staff have.
I thought people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The production of Croatian and baroque wines increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while the production of food decreased by 3 per cent."
The RSM analyst Paul Nyömens (Paul Newman) said: "These results continue to be observed at the end of April.
The impact of time-consuming and broad social or sport measures is the major factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although sales drop by 4.8 per cent, compared with the period in question last year, will be particularly painful for additional unsustainable costs.
With regard to food suppliers in the cold and cold weather, it was not possible to have access to it at an even more inappropriate time, and the time will show whether a more moderate temperature that we usually experience in August will provide a much needed room."
The overall increase in sales between shops and restaurants, including in new companies, was 2.7% in July reflecting a decrease in the sales volume of brands.
"Coffer Peach Tracker", which is an observer for the sale of the United Kingdom circuits, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the data of the 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion stars and has developed a sectoral criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that hides from their parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey involving 20,000 high school students revealed a false increase in Instagram.
These reports have caused concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to the parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, develops social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In the survey involving 20,000 secondary schools, it was found that Instagram’s photo collection site rapidly increased the number of fake profiles.
These reports have caused concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "clean main" account to show parents and also private accounts.
A 13 - year - old girl who stood by her secret site discovered a young woman who encouraged others to save her.
In a study conducted by the Digital Awarenes UK and the Independent School Managers Conference (HMC), 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds found that there were two profiles and only half of them recognized that they had private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan (Mike Buchanan) said: "It's scary that so many teenagers make online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilida Doila will be "floating voice" in the Scotland Veglatläticas government
At the annual meeting of the Governing Council of Elijhi Doyle, Scotland was elected as Director of the Vieglatläticas of Scotland.
Doila is the most popular space and medical facility in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those who are driving their sport to use his extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilids are given great respect throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's lighthouse community, and we are convinced that Scotland will soon gain enormously much by joining its government," Beatijs said.
Doila said: "I want to work as a "floating voice" and I hope I can really get involved and help towards this type of sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in the Atlantic is thus able to acquire four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC flag, unable to follow the past ischemic step.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day I experienced an insult a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that only time would show or how much longer I would stay.
It was a funny job, but I was completely relieved, and I was learning to walk again and I can do business training today!
Thank you for your touching words!"
A breast-fed milk pump advertising that compares mothers to cows
The raw milk starch production company has been prepared for shared views online on the advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to cowing.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "first-class breast-feeding pump" in circulation, the consumer technology company "Elvie" publishes a fine message to demonstrate the freedom that breast-feeding mothers provide with a new incentive.
Four real mother's play with a wall-filled doll in the box at a song that sounds like, "Yes, I am listening to myself, but you don't see any ass" and "If you didn't notice, they're not pregnant, they're my heart."
In the accompanying box I will continue: "Send, send, send, I'll take the little ones, send, I'll send, I'll kiss my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has given a wide range of reasoning online.
The 77,000-fold video that has been viewed and commented hundreds of times has received partial feedback from viewers, and many claim that it results in the light of milk industry 's noise'.
"It is a very wrong decision to use raw product advertising.
Just like us, they must become pregnant and breast-feeding to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after their birth," he wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk powder does not cover breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast milk for mothers who can keep their babies?"
The idea was also expressed: "The advertising producers didn't know what to do."
Others stood up for the commercial, and a woman admitted that she thought the music was "excited".
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have bought it if I were still breast-feeding.
The milk withdrawal made me look like a cow.
The advertising is a bit of a joke, but I understand its idea.
This is a great product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a bit of a commercial, thought-made mother who picks up milk (in places of work or toilets) and feels like "govis".
It is not a commercial that glorifys or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the advertising group, the women discovered that they were all playing with uncooked drums placed in their chests.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who take milk claim to feel like cattle.
But the Elvie Pump is completely deaf, there is no guide and no noise, and it is unexplained to the pregnant women in the chest, allowing them to move freely, keep small and even take part in outdoor activities.
Anna Balarin (Ana Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director commented: "Elvie Pump" is such a revolutionary product that it has benefited from a courageous and provocative marketing.
By drawing parallels between women who take off milk and milk cows, we wanted to focus on milking, while at the same time demonstrating the disturbing sense of freedom that will bring the new incentive."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has gone to the center of attention.
On the week of the London Modes, two children’s mother appeared at the girl’s eyes at Martha Jakubovskas (Marta Jakubowski) using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children were moved to a remote town near the border of Texas
The number of children detained has increased rapidly, although the border has been crossed by relatively many people as in the past, and in part has been achieved by the brutal rhetoric and policy of the Trampa administration, which has made it difficult to eradicate children from sponsors.
The majority of sponsors have also been themselves immigrants without documents, fearing that, when they are told to take the child, it will threaten their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their households would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and these data would also be transmitted to other immigration authorities.
Last week, Mattjø Albenss (Matthew Albence), the senior executive of the enforcement of immigration and customs laws, confirmed before the Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had applied for sponsors for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons were not previously convicted.
"Nearly 80 per cent of people who are either sponsors or sponsors' family members are living here illegally, and most of these people are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to walk like this," Mr. Albensa said.
According to the asylum staff, in an effort to speed up the examination of children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules which provide that some of them will have to enter court within a month of detention, not after 60 days of the previous standard.
Many will take advantage of the opportunity of a video conference called not to come in personally in order to defend their legal status before the judge.
Persons who will be considered inappropriate for the acquisition of exemption will be released soon.
The longer children are detained, the greater the chance that they will become inadmissible or weakened, which may lead to violent attacks or refugee attempts, shall be reported in accordance with the information provided by asylum-seekers and the certificates obtained from the system during the last few months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns would be strengthened in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where signs of child suffering are more often ignored because of their size.
They add that the transfer of children to a distant city without enough time for emotional preparation or for the possibility of getting rid of friends could lead to problems that many have already faced.
Syria is forced by the United States, France and Turkey's "opposite troops" to withdraw their forces immediately
When returning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids al-Moualems (Walid al-Mouelem) also invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country had already taken place for eight years.
Moulem, who also fulfilled the duties of the Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria in response to the fight against terrorism and "will be solved accordingly".
"They must depart immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moulalems claimed that in Syria, where more than 36 million people have been forced to leave their homes since the 2011 earthquake, "the war against terrorism is almost over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in the holy war until all the Syrian territories are cleared" were removed from both terrorist groups and "the military presence of any foreign country".
The United States of America has deployed around 2000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and consulting both the military forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opposition to President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualems announced that the conditions had been great for them to return, and accused "the individual Western countries" of "irradiation of irradial fear" as a result of which refugees did not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these return visits," he said.
"These people are politifying what should be only humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive State aid for recovery before the end of the war between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that recent agreements between Russia and Turkey to establish buffer zone in Idlib (Idlib) have created opportunities for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has led Russia to a wide range of Syrian-supported attacks in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "is certain times" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the guerrillas, including fighters from Al-Qaeda related group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
United Nations envoy Stefan de Mistura (Stuffan de Mistura) hopes to establish a new committee, which includes government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to develop a Syrian constitution for the post-war period and to pave the way for elections.
The Moulelems set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the group's work would be limited to "review of existing constitutional articles", and warned of interference.
Why Tramps will be selected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be elected to the 2020 elections only if, on the other hand, many liberal observers, embassies and scandals are likely to not precipitate the point to his presidency.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic final of the presidency all the time!"
Now there is no evidence of the silence of observers.
Since 2014, the most successful CNN race has been more than doubled by reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has nearly tripled by reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is looking at 2.4 million viewers in the most exciting weather compared to 1.7 million years ago, reports the company Nielsen, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichel Medova's show) is located at the highest level on cable television with 3.5 million main viewers at night.
"It's a fire that touches many people because it's something we don't understand," explained Neil Bayers (Neal Baer), based on ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama. This drama tells about the secretary of the ministry's office who becomes the president after the attack is destroyed by the Capitol.
Nellai Skowelai (Nell Scovell), comedy for the Veteran writer and "Just the Funny Party: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is its theory.
She remembers her trip with a taximeter in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that he was voting for Mr. Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he's smiling at me,' said Mrs. Skovelas.
Haos is, to a certain extent, deceptive.
Of course, unlike all the others that watch TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with Ruu's judgment against Vidu, whether immigrant families will be able to join and the global economy.
Ignorance is a speed that can only be allowed by the most popular observers.
And yet it is more than informing a citizen at six o'clock to see a group of experts discussing how Bob Vudford (Bob Woodward) has used anonymous sources of information for his book "Fear", Pola Manafort (Paul Manafort) $15,000 worth of bomber-type jackets from the rapid colors and skin ("Turkey from which the noise is overwhelming", said "Washington Post" and what will be the role of Stormy Daniels (Stormy Daniels) in the fate of Trampa, that is to say, anatomic details.
For example, I will never forget Super Mario again as before.
"Some of what he does that makes the effect of this effect is that he is every day surrounded by information," Brent Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), the Executive Director of Wellhouse Entertainment and this "Pown Stars" was explained by the writer of the Trampa's changing team and daily orientations (Chivin with N.F.L., Kima Čenuna).
You can't let your soul go into some kind of episode, because otherwise you'll stay.
When I was in the tunnel to Mr. Fleiss (Fleiss), the time of Kaua in the north coast (Cuaai) was sun 80 degrees (~27 after Celsia), but he sat in the rooms where he saw the creation of MSNBC while entering CNN.
He was unable to stand back, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and his future Supreme Court threatened to stand.
"I remember the time when we formed all these tapes and when people claimed that "It's the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleisa told me.
"I think it's not that bad, but it'll show that they were right."

Money from abroad to put in the most controversial parliamentary mid-election in the pre-election campaigns
It is no wonder that the 17th-century electoral region of the Convention is going to receive money through the reform of the Convention, which will result in two existing Members fighting one place.
This recently modified Pittsburgh nominee area is linked to the democratic representative Konor Lemb (Conor Lamb), who won his own special election last spring in another region.
Lembs will fight with another current Member, the Republican Kita Rothfus (Keth Rothfus), who is currently representing some of the 12 regions of Pennsylvania, which are largely covered by the new 17th.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were not constitutionally divided into good republics, the cards were recast.
Competition in the new 17th region has created a conflict between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won a small victory over the popular election of March in the 18th Assembly Hall of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans had been in this area for more than 10 years, and President Donald Tramps won 20 points in this area.
The policy experts provide for a small surplus for democracies.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for supporting China, but then thought
The diplomats recognize that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama (Juan Carlos Varela), and he was staying in the hotel in Panama until the partners left behind the management team of the Trampa organisation.
The Heads of State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan", the representative of the Department of State Hitare Nauerte (Hather Nauert) indicated in a notice earlier this month.
However, it was considered to apply only to Salvador, which received about 140 million large amounts from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed for reducing financial aid and limiting targeted visas would be painful for the Central American country where unemployment and unemployment have reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials left a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being and following a similar meeting last year, which recognized efforts to avoid the move of migrants to the United States.
In mid-September, the State's senior officials clearly expressed their wish that the conference should, in effect, end the sentence of El Salvador completely.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pens (Mika Pence) had now decided to participate in the planned conference in mid-October to show how serious the administration is stressing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sentences from Washington.
The White House, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide more information on the debates that three American officials described, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss in the internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
Their story was confirmed by an external analyst who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be maintained.
Study of history
The second stone garden could contain a special prosecutor's report by Robert Millera (Robert Mueller) that Mr. Trampa may have suspended justice, which has very much evidence in society.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trampa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our wishes.
If there is a second party in Congress, Trappam will be responsible for this structure and perhaps also for his colleagues' party at the time when he is already going to meet with the voters.
There is a lot of "but," and I do not claim that the trumpet is inevitable or that it will happen to its fellows in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for us all on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and these will show the length of the war.
In 1938 the German presidents were ready to take a stand against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported Chechnya in Minhe.
We will be able to avoid the age - old spirit of bloodshed.
History is moving around such turning points, and the unstoppable path of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
The Americans now have to deal with several such points of view.
What will we begin if Mr. Trampa rejects General Prosecutor Rod Rozenstein (Rod Rosenstein) — a man who controls Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has faced difficulties since it was reported that he has proposed secretly to negotiate with the President in the past year and has argued that he is not fit for the task.
Mr Rozenstein says the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How can we answer if the requested FBI investigation of Brit Caveno will not be complete or fair or even if he will be approved by the Supreme Court of Justice for his dishonest testimony and the alleged sexual assault?
And what is the most important thing is that we vote for Congress, which will be called the Trappo on responsibility, the mid-term election?
If we don't keep all these checks, democracy will be in the north.
But I believe that we will all be able to draw attention to what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was the Hebrew of Chechnya, which was sent directly to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once attacked my missionary home.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later I was sent to serve on the swastika table.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

"Rangers" star Grems Dorans (Graham Dorrans) felt optimistic about the fight against the wine "Rapid"
"Rangers" will take on its own "Rapid" wine on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after an impressive undistributed game in Spain with "Villareal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position in order to qualify from the Group of the European Union G.
The road trauma did not allow the centre's attacker Graham Doransam to resume participating in the season games until the undistributed result with 2:2 with "Villareal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a tramline to achieve more.
"We can be happy about this because Villareal is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We're going to play the game to believe that we're going to be able to make good progress, and we're getting this point.
We may have been able to reach them at the end, but in general there is a good outcome.
They may have been better in the first half, but we were in the second half and were better team.
And on the fourth day there will be another important night in Europe.
We hope to get three points, but it will not be easy because they have achieved good results in the previous game, but I am convinced that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
The past year with all my traumas and changes in the club itself has been very difficult, but now I have new news that I feel good about.
The team is great, and it's good to taste it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave the past season behind the wall and make progress."
Women cannot sleep because they are worried about their pensions
Although the interviewees knew clearly what kind of care they wanted to receive, few had discussed this with family members.
About half of the people in a national study indicated that they did not talk to a married friend about the long-term cost of care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of their family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it," reveals Holly Snaidere (Holly Snyder), Vice-President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can’t prepare your family for the need to take care of yourself if you don’t do your own will in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices may be an important factor in determining costs.
Join your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with a cash amount to meet these costs or also by using your property — mainly for your benefit.
Develop your legal documents. Avoid legal battles before they are started.
Talk to mature people about health issues so that you can be trusted by a person who will monitor your health care and ensure that professional actions are done according to your wishes, unless you are forced to express them to your own strength.
Consider also the possibility of granting financial authority.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf who will be prepared to pay your bills if you do not try to do so on your own.
And don’t forget the details in detail! Imagine that one of your parents is being taken to the hospital to get help from you.
Will you start answering questions about medicines and allergies?
Please indicate these facts in the written plan so that you do not regret this situation.
"And it's not only about finances but also about who's a doctor," said Martina.
"What are the medicines used?
What are you gonna do about the dog?
Prepare to develop such a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the city of Palu on Friday killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of victims will increase.
Because of the communications issued, the survivors were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala (Dongal) region located in the north of Palu and are nearly 7.5 magnitudes of a strong earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after natural disasters.
See the basic information about Palu and Dongalu located on the island of Slavaki:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located on the west side of the Sulawesi island. It is estimated that 379,800 people lived there in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis erupted.
Dongala is an area that extends about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Slavavi Island.
It is estimated that in 2017 there were 299,200 people living in the area of the provincial administrative region.
Fishing and landing are the economic foundation of the Central Slaves province, particularly in the region of the present Dongala.
The harvest also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali (Morowali), Slavaki on the opposite side.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several times over the past 100 years from the tsunami.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by tsunamis and hundreds of buildings were destroyed in Donegal.
Cunami also gased over the eastern part of Donegal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located seismicly active in the Pacific Ocean in the direction where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in the north of the Aceah (Aceh) province caused tsunamis which devastated 14 countries on 26 December killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean border line, of which more than half were found in Aceh.
2005: A strong series of earthquakes visited the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Seven hundred people were killed on the island of Nyas (Nia) on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitudes were strong in the earthquake caused by Java, Indonesia’s most inhabited islands in the south, resulting in the deaths of nearly 700 people in the south.
2009: 7.6 Magnitudes of strong earthquake soon emerged from the city of Padanda (Pandad) — the capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were injured.
2010: 7.5 strong quakes visited one of the islands of Mentavai (Mentawai) on the Sumatra shores, causing up to 10 metres high tsunamis, which unleashed tens of thousands and killed about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake near the ground visited the area of Piddie Jaya in Acah, creating posts and panics, as it reminded itself of the destruction that resulted from the 2004 earthquake and tsunamis.
This time, however, more than 100 people were killed in the ruining buildings.
2018: powerful earthquakes visited the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and eventually caused hundreds of tourists to return home.

Federal prosecutors want to request a rare-use death sentence for a person suspected of terrorist act in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of Saijfulllo Saifov (Sayfulllo Saipov), who is suspected of terrorist acts in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
According to the claim, 30-year-old Saipovs used Home Depot rental cars to launch an attack on the road along West Side Highway in Lejas Manhattan (Lower Manhattan), where he pointed out passengers and passengers on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 'with intent' has killed eight victims and 'with intent' has caused serious injury, as stated in the statement of intention to request the death penalty submitted to the New York District Court.
In the case of both of these charges, the death penalty may be pronounced in accordance with the documents of the court.
Within weeks of the attack, the major federal jury adopted a letter of complaint against Saipova on 22 charges, including eight charges of fraud, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a complaint against innocent and motorized vehicles.
The attack needed "a significant plan and a previous intention", the prosecutor explained, stating that the attack by Saipova was "a joke, an unkind and inhuman".
"Saifulllo Habibulajevičs Saipov (Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov) injured and injured these people's families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolass Klivs (Nicolas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Dekadta (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darens Drake (Darren Drake), Ariels Elihs (Ariel Erlij), Ernáns Feruchi (Hernan Ferruchi), Ernest Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pannocco (Alejan Damian Pagnucco)," wrote about the opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the South New York District Court have made a complaint in a case where a death sentence may be imposed.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of two drug suppliers, but finally he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in 2009.
The case was last carried out in New York’s federal case in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg (Jullius and Ethel Rosenberg), a relative who was sentenced to death following a charge of forced participation in the Council’s good war in the Union two years earlier.
The death penalty for Rozenberg was executed on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, for days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he informed the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the letter of the complaint, Saipovs told officials that he had taken the initiative to make an attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed him that he had also requested permission to put the ISIS card in his room.
He has rejected 22 charges.
David Patton (David Patton), one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he is "very uncomfortable" about the ruling.
"We believe that the intention to require the death penalty is not to accept confession of guilt in exchange for eternal imprisonment without the right to release the trauma that is occurring will only extend to all the parties involved," Patons explained.
The Saipova defence team has previously called on the prosecutors not to request the award of a death sentence.
The Conservative Member announces that the management of Brexita negotiations must be held by NAIDJEEL FAZAM
Najgel Farážs promised to "mobilize the people's army" during the Conservative Conference during the protest.
A former leader of the British Independent Party announced that politicians should shower Eurosceptic smoke when one of the Members of the Teresa May Parliament proposed that negotiations with the EU should be held with him.
The Conservative Chief of Staff, Peter Bouns (Peter Bone), announced to the March in Birmingham that Britain would already have appeared if Mr. Farráža was Minister Brexita.
However, the challenge that will have to be faced by Mrs Mejas, trying to persuade her opposition party, was demonstrated by conservatives who supported the stay of the EU and joined in a particular protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on future relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and to face attacks from those who want to leave the EU, those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The Association said that she would be committed to reaching an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and it would allow Eurosceptics and liberators to choose between her offer and "haos".
Mr. Bouna "Leave Means Leave" (expression means departure) in Solihall (Solihull) announced that he wanted to launch the May Plan at the table (to Chuck Chechers).
He suggested that Pharaoh be married and have confidence in him in his dealings with Brussels.
"If he had been to say it, we'd already been out," Bones said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough adds: "I support Brexit, but we need to launch the May Plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight to be servants!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr. Boune ignored the admission that the public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that Britain has changed its mind and wants to remain in the EU is absolutely unacceptable."
Brexita's supporter Andrea Jenkins (Andrea Jenkyns) also participated in the march and told the reporters: "I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not recommended by the public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and our supporters who are actually doing all the work and we are chosen.
Please answer from Chequers and start listening."
In the report on May, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in his place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that policymakers should feel pressure if they fail to comply with the decision adopted in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us — people — and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do it."
In his letter, he adds: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the fight against Brexit, and we will never get rid of it until we achieve that we are independent, self-governing, beautiful United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the rest of the passengers walked through Birmingham before the city center had a two - hour bridge.
Unknown activists encouraged conservatives against Brexita banners after a group meeting this weekend.
The representative of the parties of the parties, Lords Adonis, spoke in Conservatives about the security issues they had experienced at the beginning of the party's application.
"These are people who claim to be able to maintain the IT system order and all their technology for Canada and still, on an undistributed border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There are no such things as successful Brexit," he added.

Russia Grand Prix: Lüiss Hamilton comes to the World Championship title after the command allows him to defeat Sebastian Fatell
From the time Valteri Botas qualified on Saturday before Luisa Hamilton became clear that the work of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the competitions.
From the start, Botas began well and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his place on the first two trips and called on Fatell to attack his teammate.
Fatel’s first step in the fight was to leave Hamilton alone to end up with others, which was most likely decisive.
The Mercedes pilot was completed again later and returned from Fatele, but Hamilton continued to stand up to the leaders after a comparison of forces that saw Ferrari's passengers unremittingly leave free, risking to stay behind behind a double-manaver to protect the third wheel.
The Verstapens tax started from the back row and was completed at the end of the first round on its 21st birthday.
After that, he was leading a large part of the story because he focused on the shootings to quickly reach the finish line and see Kim Raikonen on the fourth floor.
Finally, he landed in the cave about 44 C.E., but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight circles because Raikon remained the fourth.
This is a hard day because Valter was doing great work all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an extremely important job to get one of two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
On Saturday, President Donalds Tramps, Senator Diana Feinstein, spoke out against his refusal to release a letter from the Christian Blaisian Ford, in which he accuses the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in the meantime in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly about Forda's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, but commented that what happened to the Senate showed that people are "bad, unbelievably and unbelievable."
"A man who can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate when there are ghosts when he sees ghosts, evils, inconsequential and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When you read press releases and published information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I won't do it."
Atceries?
Diana Feinstein, have you been misinformed?
Remember her answer to the question... or did you load the document? "Well, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I won't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it... No, we didn't do it," he added, at the senator's intone.
In July a letter was sent to Fenstein explaining what Forda was accused of, and the content of the letter was published in early September, but Fenstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Forda's charges, I "non-uppressed" her story, "Fenstein told the Commission, reports "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did the same."
But her refusal did not like the President, who commented on this situation on Saturday evening: "I would tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst part of the body language I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court of three women accused of sexual harassment, the President proposed that democracy be used for its own good.
"They are objectively excited to regain power through any means."
Do they not care what they suffer to destroy them in order to gain power and control," said the President-in-Office of the Media.

Air traffic controller dies by allowing hundreds of people in the aircraft to escape during the earthquake
One air traffic controller in Indonesia is driven by a hurricane after he sacrificed himself to get hundreds of passengers safely out of the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have lost their lives after a powerful earthquake destroyed Slavaki Island on Friday, causing tsunamis.
The territory will continue to be very well after the harvest and many are scattered in the double town of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Ganaváns Agungs refused to leave his place of work at Mutaria Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport, which was badly damaged.
He stayed in his post to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the train, would be safe in the air.
After that, he decided to leave the traffic control tower, thinking it could be destroyed.
He died in the hospital later.
The Indonesian Air Navigation Representative, Johannes Sirates, said that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC news.
We were preparing a helicopter from Balikapan, Kalimantan to deliver it to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter hit Pala.
"We're so worried to hear it," he adds.
Meanwhile, national authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach a thousand, state disaster prevention agencies claim that access to Dongalas, Sig and Butangao (Butung) is limited.
"It seems to be a beautiful increase, as many people are still under the roofs, and many are not able to access," said the agency's representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of 6 feet [6 m], set off the Pala, where this festival will be held by mass children.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and the necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old new mother, "Sky News" said: "In minutes a fast medical service introduces new victims.
Pure water is scarce.
Small shops are all over the place."
Jans Gelfands, leader of the International Sarkan Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Sarkan Cross of Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all be worse."
On Sunday, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu and said to the national military officer: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
This year Indonesia has already been devastated by earthquakes in Lombo, where more than 550 people have died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says one of the people is lost after the plane crash
The airline carried out a flight during which it landed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people was missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the hot air.
Air Niugini announced the press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — men.
The company announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find missing men.
The company did not immediately respond to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local people with ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane was hit by water by trying to stay at Chuuk Island Airport.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were hospitalized.
The civil society reported that six people remained in the hospital until the sixth day, and all of them are in a stable condition.
The reasons for the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the aircraft has been hit by a plane shortly after departure from the plane.
For some anacondas, it was thought that the plane would be reassessed.
American passenger Bill Jens said that the plane was very low.
"It was really good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the hot air by using emergency exits because the water was only in the middle.
He said that the rats were panicking and screaming, as well as that he had a slight headache.
Seafarers working near the U.S. Navy to improve the ship’s crew also helped in rescue operations by using an accessible ship to transport people to the shore before the flight of about 30 metres (100 feet) below water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the past two decades, 111 people have been living in PNG registered airlines, no one has been connected to Air Niugini.
Psychoanalysis commentator explains what happens at night when a woman was burned
On the sixth day, the complaint gave further evidence in the case under review where a man is accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's psychoanalyses commented on Paul Rovlets in several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained how he used the phone information to gather together how the new 29 - year - old Quintons Telis and 19 - year - old Jessica Chambers acted at night when she died.
Rovlets said that he received the location data from several telephones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger".
When the data showed that his phone was located at Chambers when he claimed that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police took Sanford out.
On the sixth day, Sanford’s court ruled that he was not in the city on that day.
When the defendant asked if Telis told the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford machine that night, Sanford said he "melo because my car was in Nešvil."
Another uncertainty was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after his death.
The phone records show that they know each other only for weeks.
Rovlets said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Telis deleted from Chambers the information, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Heils.
It is expected that the defence will provide its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be handed over to the jury later that same day.

Black again?!
In New York, the plant has been asked to withdraw after receiving the "rasistic" message
In New York a court case of discriminatory dismissal after she had received the wrong message from the mother who complained that the seed "is still black."
He refused to find out by comparing the court's case to "pressure".
Lindsia Plasko-Flaksman, a mother of two children, expressed her discouraging attitude by acknowledging that the new child carer, Jessel Mauris, was blackned when she started her first day at work in 2016.
"NEARLY, ATKAL MELNAIS," Plastko-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a brief note.
However, she sent news not only to her husband but also to Mauritius twice.
Reluctant to its inaction, Plasco-Flaxman's release from Mauritius, stating that his former student who was an African American had done a bad job and that she was expecting the Philippines, referring to New York Post.
Maurizio paid for her one work day and sent her home with Uber.
Maurice has now appealed to the court to ask for compensation for her resignation and wants to receive $350 a day for six months of work with the guaranteed residence for which she initially applied for, in addition to the contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't do," she said on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations that they had found out by claiming that Mauritism’s termination was a reasonable decision because they feared that after her trial they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We didn't find out, "Joel Plasko, man, said "Post."
"Bet, would you trust your children to someone against whom the ruins were held, even if it happened just because of a mistake?
Your baby?
But think about it."
The court's seats compared to "pressure", Plasko said his wife had just been born two months back and was very "in a very difficult situation".
"You're really heading towards something like this?
It is not an acceptable action," the investment banker added.
While justice is still being done, public opinion is rapidly being brought to justice through social networks, destroying them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the book Paddington were worried that readers would not be able to associate with the speaker’s laity
Karen Jennkela, a young woman from Bonda, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard to put herself "in some pockets", which read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very surprising now to know what we know about the great achievements of Paddington."
She added that her father, who worked as an operator BBC before he felt compelled to write books to children about a small rotary stick, was optimistic that his work would be rejected.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls "a very important member of the family", her father listened carefully to her potential success.
"He was deaf, deaf man and he wasn't great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if you had a child who would achieve something: you liked even if you hadn't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was her creation and her image fruit, he always gave all the benefits to Paddington himself."
I had to get off my dead girl by phone.
After her fall, her daughter was rushed to the Nicas hospital, where Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors repeatedly fought for her life.
"Neds called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she wouldn't survive," Edna-Laperúza said.
"Then I received a call from Neda saying that her death was almost two minutes away and I had to leave her.
And I did the same.
I said, "Tai, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctor gave her in order to maintain her heart rate gradually ended and left her body.
She would have died sooner and that's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't get or cry because I'll be in a situation where there's family and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to run."
Finally, after losing her daughter in a massive crash, Edna-Laperúza entered the plane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I'll put my head on the floor and the bear walked all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt deep compassion for Ned during the flight.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
A pregnant woman strengthens her wallets on her knees to prevent suicide
Two loving women who have committed suicide act to help others not to lose their lives.
Charon Devis and Kelia Hamfrey strengthens the cards at the Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Divis ’ son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed, but he committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want a parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Devis, who lives in Lithuania for 45 years, says that his son was a multiracial rival with an addiction - causing disorder.
"Each one recognized him after a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he refused to work before he died because he was "very, very dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was only 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Devis said, "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Devisi created maps, "to make it known that there are people who can turn to and talk to even if it is a friend.
You don't have to sit in the audience, you have to talk."
For years, a brother named Devis lost his wife, Mark, to the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was right or that he was depressed or anything else was right," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that her attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning when the child opened gifts he did not contact them or something like that."
Her death was a great tragedy for the children, but they must finally be told: "It affects the whole family.
That's our choice.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Breta Kaveno's future in the air of war because the FBI is starting to research
"I think if we could really get what he is asking for – in a limited amount of time and time research – we might be able to reach a little consensus," Fleix said on Saturday, adding that he is concerned that the commission "parts" between the oppressed party stocks.
Why do Kavano and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
They're just being held in silence.
Intervention is five weeks later, on November 6th — if the Republicans are expected to go bad, then their attempts will be weaker to choose a man from among them.
George V. Bush called on the senators, encouraging them to support Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Busa and thanked him for meeting his wife, Eshlie, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in Senate where 51 seats are currently owned by the Republicans but 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can receive at least 50 votes in Senate which would allow Mike Pensam, Vice-President, to vote and to be approved by his Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership 'downed' number of North Korea's asylum seekers
The number of North Korean asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong arrived seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of the Association of South Korea, said there were 1127 political asylum seekers last year, compared with 2011, when they were 2706.
The park said that stronger border control between North Korea and China and high human smuggling rates are the main factors.
Pyongyang has not given public comments.
Most political asylum seekers from the end of North Korea are offered South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go through China, which has the most border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected DMZ between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and are forced to be deported.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which continues to be a technical war, has improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries were held in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation talks.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US Presidents Donald Tramp and Kim Jongun in Singapore, when they agreed, in large trains, to cooperate to free the Korean side of nuclear weapons.
But on the sixth day, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho condemned the US sanctions since these negotiations had not made any progress.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never fight one another alone first," said Ri in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Ninsia Pelosi calls Bret Kaveno "historic" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The Court's minority leader, Ninsija Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno "historic" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court due to his temper.
Pelosi commented on the sixth day of the "Texas Tribune Festival" in Ostino, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, they would call her "historic," said Pelosi about his reaction to the witness given to the Senate court on Thursday.
Kaveno emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Bleisia Forda when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost crying and screaming, talking about his family and school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democracies in the Commission, calling against him a charge of "the destruction of agrotic and harmonised character", organised by liberals, who are excited that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that the Caveno testimony was a reason why he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a double attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he himself is disqualifying with such claims and his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when he asked whether he was trying to question Kaveno if he approved it and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say so - if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only in the Supreme Court, but also working in the current court," Pelosi said.
Kaveno is now Judge of the Washington District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democracy has decided on the possibility that Kaveno will take decisions against "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Type because he considers them a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno asked questions about whether he would reject the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not an appropriate time for a historical and double person to work in court, but we would expect us to say, "Is it not wonderful?" said Pelosi.
But women must keep their own hands.
It's a detonation, months and years, and it's all gone "a couple of miles," but she's not allowed it all out of her mind.
"We're red when we're tired," said Mrs. Steinmas to me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something you don't think you're going to find?"
She continued, "Sometimes a woman who was herself the leader of a company who said that she was also a miner when she was a ghost but created a technique — when she became a ghost and began to cry, her person I was talking to said: "You can think I'm sad because I'm red.
I'm a ghost."
And then she kept going.
And I think it's great."
Asparas as smoke discharges are recognised only partially because they are replete on their own grounds.
One of my most vivid memories is of my former work, which was of particular interest to men when I once wept because of my inexhaustible breath, when my older wife cried after me — a permanent manager (woman) who always had a little fear of me, which caused me to jump into my upper room.
"Never let them see that mine!" she said to me.
"They don't know you're over.
They think you're tired, and you're just gonna be glad that you're out of your skin.
Patrio Srédere, then US Democrats Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gerija Harttu on his presidency of the campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, who was engaged in extramarital relations, was also known as "the making of coins" and stood out of the elections, Shreeder, deeply felt angry, explaining that there was no reason why he could not apply for the presidential office.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-in decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"The wedding was already seven other candidates and the last they wanted to see one more.
It was called "Snie White and Seven Reds."
She wanted to take part in the campaign, withdrew her funds and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who had donated $1,000 to the men’s order, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get some rest?" she wondered.
When she said in her speech that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her — to the system that made it very difficult to raise money and not to talk to the voters, and she was excited about sexism — in which she was "cut off".
"You would think I had a nerve disorder," Srédere recalled how the press responded to him.
"You think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're gonna write on my cake.
"He's dead."
Why the US-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The main allegations of how the US-China trade war has begun are closed and until the war is over, differences between countries may be favourable to Beijing for a long time, experts say.
U.S. President Donalds Tramps issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most importantly, this week started with new rates affecting the unit's worth of $200 billion (150 billion metrics) immediately around half of the goods exported from the US from China.
Pekina also answers "low" every time, the latest is five to ten percent of US dollars worth of $60 billion.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to one another in the United States and there is no doubt that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be reduced.
In order to derogate from Washington, it would be necessary to agree to certain requirements, but to be publicly heard by the US would be too much for China's President Xi Sji Dji Djingpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its role correctly, the US pressure on trade can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision has been taken quickly either in Washington or in Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any country that are really more dangerous than observers have recognized before," said researcher Abigail Greisa, "New American Security" focusing on Asia.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs announced.
Syria claims that it is ready to return to the voluntary return and calls for the help of a country that has suffered more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualems said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation on earth is now much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the destroyed territories of terrorists in their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and their well-being.
The UN believes that 5.5 million Syrians have been missing since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
The mayor said that the Syrian regime would take assistance in the recovery of the country.
However, he stressed that the State would not accept aid or aid from countries that helped to sponsor non-member countries.
European golf course is a significant victory for the Raider Cup in Paris
The European golf course was won at the 2018 Raider Cup, crossing the U.S. election with a result of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe recovered the case when Mr. Thomas Bjorna, head of the board of directors, received 14.5 points that were needed to re-examine the U.S. election.
U.S. Star Phils Michaelson, who had a hard time going through all the tournament, drew his T-cocini into the water at par 3 16 feet, following the game of French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to play at all stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever had 5-0-0 results since 1979 when the tournament is played by the current format.
American Jordan Spats with 5 to 4 significantly lost European teams, after rating, at least the current player Torbjorn Olesenam from Denmark.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polteram from England, for which this was probably the last race of Raider.
The eight Raider's box veteran, Spanish Serhio Garsija, has become a tournament full-time best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not sick, but today I can't control the bears."
This was a tough year.
From my heart I am grateful to Thomas for his kind words and actions.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the bag.
This is the team's duty and I am glad that I can help," after the European election, Garcia commented emotionally.
He goes on to give his people John Rama, who won US golf legend Tager Vudsus on Sunday with 2 against 1 single game.
"The joy I feel when I win the Tager Vuds, I am eager to follow the hopes of this player," said the new 23-year-old Ramas.
Vudss lost all his four cats in France and now he has a career entry with 13-21-3 Raider.
The statistics are one of the best players in the 14th high-level golf tournaments, the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought every weekend to find its achievements, except Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. President James Furiks said after his team's inconsistencies: "I liked boys, they fought.
This was a time when we were able to create a small pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All the respect for Tomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the U.S. Raider Army Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm nice to be their captain.
You need to wear your hats.
We won."
