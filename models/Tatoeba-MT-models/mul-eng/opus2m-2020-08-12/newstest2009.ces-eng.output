The Prague Bursa fell to the end of the trade down to the minus
After an early spring fall, the Prague bourgeois had suffered losses.
Transactions with Chez shares reached almost half of the ordinary day-to-day trade.
The Prague bourgeoisie immediately pointed to the start of the morning trade on its morning break when it was almost six percent.
This time there's a crash on Wall Street.
We also have a market reaction to the results of the vote by the US Snowsman, who refused to support the plan to stabilize the dark financial sector.
Share rate in Asia
The dramatic stage in the morning was the action on the castles in Asia, even though the indexes but during the day, part of the loss finally disappeared.
In Hong Kong, Hong Kong's Hang Seng bourgeois index gave up almost four per cent during the trading period, but later lost part and decreased by 2.5 per cent.
The Hong Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, closed by 3.8 per cent in Shanghai.
The share in Sydney lost more than five per cent, but the loss finally decreased to 4.3 per cent.
The turn of the Tchaj-wana, according to the dark index, is 3.6 percent.
"The timing of rescue action in the United States is uncertain and affects the financial market all over the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, the policy of exchange is defined on its own, without any dependence on the Chinese central bank.
The annual rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, US legislators should quickly return to the meeting and propose support for the financial system to be approved.
Otherwise, they fear that other countries will be affected.
The blood vessels of American actions
The U.S. Senate rejected a plan of support for the financial system that was to be spent at least $700 billion on Monday (about 12 billion Kƒç).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
America's actions on Monday lived in the blood pool and the main stock indexes took over the largest salary for more than 20 years.
Down Jones's index was almost seven per cent and a similar increase was recorded last in 1987.
The index has already passed before the vote, but once it has been shown that the proposal has not passed in a random way, the index has been read in a free fall.
Congress arrived: The U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars into the bank
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to a broader approach to financial assistance agreements for the American financial system.
He'll be voted for at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators took half of their discussions on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system amounting to $700 billion (about $12 billion).
But it's not yet won.
Congressmen still have to complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final law and vote on it.
The support plan for the financial system will be held under the shadow of the representatives in the afternoon.
On Sunday, the Reuters Agency said it was the chairman of the Board for Banking and Financial Services of Snow Barney Frank.
According to sources in the Senate, there could be a vote on the plan at first sight in the middle.
According to the economies, it should be announced that the adoption of a rescue plan is the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, it will come to "extreme" thanks to the complexity of mechanisms which help markets to achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how to look like a package for market stabilization," said Mrs. Nancy Pelosie to the Bloomberg Democrat.
According to her, she could come to the final vote on Sunday.
Lawyers' representatives met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a final appearance to the government fund.
This should buy from financial companies non-sale mortgage assets that result in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are in favour of the definitive agreements of a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's still supposed to continue in the health plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Asian trade signal
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are soon to collapse.
According to Foreign Democratic Senator Harry Reida, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are in the first phase of the first phase, where the decision of the Congress may affect trade on Monday.
However, it is still not clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law or whether they can not meet at the latest.
Lawyers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still makes a number of changes.
The total amount assigned to the aid system shall be divided into two parts.
The original 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
The Congress can, however, block the release of the remaining shares if it has the idea that the programme does not fulfil its function, followed by another 100 billion dollars and later by the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed progress in meetings
The President of the Network may take this decision, but Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea remained of the programme which was to obtain funds for the redemption of the wrong mortgage securities, which had lost value because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've been working on everything.
The shadow representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush is also at peace with the union.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is calm with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the mutual effort to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold falls
The chairman of the banking committee, Senator Christopher Dodd, the co-rapporteur, said that the legislators agreed to take responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from loss, the closure of damages, the timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called gold tax for directors of the company's participation in the programme and set up a committee which will have oversight over the fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is also calculated with the help of house owners who have problems with payment.
The government should collect new mortgage payments with a view to reducing monthly fees for creditors and allowing them to leave their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is based on the main economy of Patria Finance David Mark with a good idea, very difficult but will be fulfilled.
"And it's because they don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will be critical of how the financial sector and the government will share the losses," said this week for the iHNed.cz Marek server.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of the next week, it is not so important according to Mark.
"It is much more important that this week's congressmen agree that they support this plan and that its mission will be soon to take place.
This psychological significance of the agreement on the arrival of approval is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Swimming on hard knife: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll figure out how to choose.
While almost every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
However, there are many reasons why a person should be organized into a single player.
The choice depends entirely on the way the future owner is used and ordered.
You'll probably find it hard at home to arrange a spicy gramophone to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products do not appear on LP tables and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you are close to your rules about art rock, jazz or blues, you probably have a minimum dream of such a gramfon.
It's the same with music on the streets, so music compressed, easy - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For someone it may be unacceptable to lose for the player eight thousand crowns, as well as for the fan Pink Floyd might be a hard-tested audience for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there's enough space for each one.
The choice is wide.
It also decides to maintain the battery
Some Spike Music Players can do much more than just play music, but most mobiles don't even know how to do it.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
According to primary functions, phone calls and performances, he is able to play music and videos, both play, he has better photos here, and he can even navigate.
And if we take the smartphones and communications, you'll have a laptop and a small computer.
It's a little surprise, because no refrigerator can dig and no TV can photograph anything.
Universality of the cell also brings an inefficiency.
The more you use your mobile functions, the more your display indicator will be sent to the tenderer.
And playing music is one of the biggest sources of energy.
A small cell phone can play music for more than ten hours, most of it is much smaller.
In this direction, musical players (especially the simplest) are much more effective.
In cheap phones, therefore, calculate that they won't play you for a few hours.
If you're still calling here and there, go to work for the security of another offer - it's also paid for the expensive equipment.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, even if the worst will last at least 9 hours of unpredictably running on one click.
Another problem arises when you're recording music into your cell.
Unfortunately only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can directly connect to computers without special software.
Of course, music can be played directly on a memory card, but only a small reader can draw a card without reducing advice with minimal memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
You do not need any special software for players to exception (iPod).
It's enough device to fill in music via USB from the computer.
Most of the mobile phones and players are already creating their own music library based on the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the user's rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of the addressees like the Wi-Fi in Windows and some are both capable (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are listening to songs, mobiles are more capable
When selecting a particular device, you are particularly interested in the maintenance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course also about the comfort of control.
If your music is first class and if you listen to it every day just a short time in the tramway, you will have enough any cell phone that plays MP3.
What's really going to happen is almost any cell phone.
You don't have to watch too much of the music formats of your cell phone or player.
MP3 will control all and simple majority of the music that will be delivered to you in this format.
It belongs to the most extensive and, besides it, most of the devices can also control music in WMA format.
Less AAC is issued (forming used by Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow for, for example, buying online music.
It‚Äôs enough to visit the operator‚Äôs (or other supplier‚Äôs) relevant websites via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a valid argument for the control of the music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is unfair and limits most of them only to speed-up radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is the future of the music industry.
Most people still have their cell phone.
Whenever you get to feel like listening to something, your cell phone gets stuck in your pocket while the MP3 player is at home.
However, it still depends on whether you're always wearing an earring or at least expensive handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every cell, but only at least MP3 players.
Probably the greatest benefit of music mobiles will be for a lot of prices.
The lowest is usually less than three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you're already running a very good fightman.
However, most of you will be limited by the absence of access to a regular audience.
The best and technically best available telephones and 3.5 mm wall for ordinary audiences are up to fifteen thousand.
The outcome of the players is beyond any other easy service.
The simplest - no matter how easy (see our choice) - player has the power to really control everyone.
The minimum function, the level of control with a previous ordinary tape recorder or the need for a gramphone is obvious.
It does not threaten the railways in the form of a broken mobile internet error and then a closed account for data transfer.
What device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) have slots on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
And with the purchase of the relevant cards, you're going to go into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Except for the most expensive advice with 8 GB memorabilities.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, please check out Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not lose more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are looking for more comfortable audiences, you will find more advice on specialized mobiles - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have a self-control button for MP3 and the service comfort is so close to the individual MP3 player.
They're still in Sony Ericsson's range, whose mobiles from a series of walkman have some familiar user interfaces as self-saled MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and maintains the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will lead to MP3 players from the above mentioned characters.
The first virtual operator comes to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech is relatively successful and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, there's something wrong with us here - a virtual operator that's going to get these classics down.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that frequent operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we've been writing on Mobile.cz many times.
Finally, he confirmed this also by the CTU, which warned us that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission on the field of regulation of roaming charges, it may be possible to come to a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will be cheaper abroad than home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and penetrations up to 100%.
Mobile operators, however, are pleased to note that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this context, they are often called upon by the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Paul Dvor√°k, who has repeatedly stated that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is true that a classic operator with its own network is no longer too likely to have too much chance (lastly, it would probably be difficult to find frequency).
But there's another possibility - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a significant reduction in prices to which classical operators have also had to respond.
In addition, just before the entry into the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile, there were similar voices like ours in Great Britain.
But it has shown that the place for such operators is and can be truly successful.
Finally, we don't have to walk too far for example.
In the course of this year, we have informed you about the start of the virtual mobileking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator was forced to receive more than 100 thousand customers and to become the largest fifth operator in the country.
In addition to Mobilking, the Penta financial group is located in the Czech Republic outside the U:found.
The outcome of virtual operators is an opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they still have a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They also bear relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In the world, such virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often measured by a higher offer of services.
So Tesco Mobile in Great Britain may offer SMS at least half cheaper than his competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good team and a flag on an unarmed target group.
This operator is also concerned specifically with men.
"Legal guys like Mobilking - an operator they like and they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, running this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like this could catch up with us in Poland.
The press spokesman Vodafon Miroslav ƒåepicky doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for segmental access, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, the services offer is relatively saturated."
In Czech without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations do not seem too promising.
More likely, Mobilking will be released in other countries of our region," said Jana Studnik, a press member of the Penta Financial Group in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
She did not directly confirm that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not strongly influenced by this opinion.
On the other hand, he's trying to do everything so that no potential competitor could arise.
The interest of the release of a virtual mobile operator has been lost for a long time by the GTS Nover group, which would therefore want to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 telephone on the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in the fact that we can offer our customers not only solid but also mobile telecom services.
And as soon as it's done, it's better.
We've been dealing with all the Czech mobile operators over and over again.
Some of them have already made progress in our meetings," says Paul Kaidl, a member of the press.
Well, maybe he's getting closer to better times.
From informal information it appears that we should wait until the end of the year for the first virtual operator.
In the past, however, his cause is an inexhaustible grace of silence.
"At this point we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of an adequate virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
In the past, no entity with a complex and serial project in this area," he said in his statement to Mobile.cz Vlastimil Srschenn from the O2 Press Committee.
Other operators are also calling for the specificity of the Czech market.
Press spokesman T-Mobil Martin Kemrov√° adds in a very rare way with the statement O2: "We have not yet noted any viable and mutually beneficial business project that could be continued."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, some virtual operator will find it difficult by the end of the year.
At this point we should already have a specific agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone is paying more attention to the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav ƒåepicky says: "We are open with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
That's exactly what we think of customers as the most prestigious.
The main Vodafon strategy in this area is to find a partner for building a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to price cuts and, therefore, a loss of profits.
So why make it easy for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to something, operators will be able to pull for one operation, witnesses and warehouses around the U:found.
Almost the largest pressure towards CTU went at the time of U:fona from T-Mobile company.
This information is publicly available on the CTU website.
But right now U:fon seems to be an argument why the virtual operator doesn't let go.
Martin Kemrov said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry into the market of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in the PRC, it is evident that the entry of another player would be high on him and, above all, on his services."
In view of this approach, however, mobile operators are directly offensive to the interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
However, it is not only the status of the CTU which has been regretted in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - that does not have the power to invest in economic competition.
These are exclusively members of the Authority for the Protection of Economic Competition (EEA).
But this guy's got his typical position on the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the acquisition of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract was ever concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not of sufficient interest to the classical operators," Kristian Chalupa of the Committee on External Relations said in answer to our question.
The representatives of operators may not be surprised by such wording.
It is more than considered by the Authority to represent the interests of consumers and, above all, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristi√°n Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually operate, we can note that their access to the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, it is clear that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decrease does not belong to the interests of the EEAS.
In fact, the whole case is that it's a great deal of experience for three mobile operators, which is a result of their reactions.
The question is, if it's just an accident, it's all about itself.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline in the canals, it is certainly only part of the deal and a strong competitive fight.
"The Authority has not looked for signs of anti-fraud treatment in this regard, and therefore has no reason to do so in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, since they do not have a corresponding higher responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be available to telecom regulators," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Understandably, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, which provides telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition in the single market.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on this market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - that the source of the virtual operator is always needed by the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has a whole logic - on his monopol network.
So in a particular segment it must be dominant.
Even if we do not give up these arguments, for the EEAS, it should be at least cautioned that three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
In addition to the difficulties of a number of stakeholders (including the mentioned GTS Novera companies), it is shown that all operators are subject to very similar obstacles when meeting.
The recognition of responsibility for CTU is then relatively common in telecommunications, which the EOHS gives away from the full scope of hand care.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent new telecoms law did not allow the extension of CTU‚Äôs power to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, as a result of which a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must be more than good for the representatives of the European Union, but they are obviously interested in others.
That's what happens when nobody sees it.
In addition, there is no mention of the functioning of any pseudo-door operators that exist in Czech mobile networks several times.
These are companies that issue their own prices of mobile telephone services, which are only partially public.
Usually it's about a company that lives on multiple-level marketing.
Your own mobile phone services such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these companies will usually be available only to the approved company.
Kouzlo starts by acting as a classic company customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, you will then receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibiting similar sales.
"If the cases you're talking about could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would have to deal with and could be released at the end of cooperation with that company," answered Martin Kemrov.
It is unlikely, however, that similar activities would not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators are immune to such a procedure.
As a result of the activities of these companies, they still have unprecedented profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåepicky warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, but the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of customers.
They must also accept that SIM cards on their phone are not addressed by their names, so they cannot be fully available as regular customers of mobile operators."
But it should be at least weird.
In addition, another issue will be raised for the EAGGF.
If mobile operators are pointing at a similar process of eyes, why are they blocking the cause of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the EAGGF has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not wish, it must not be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no such thinking and their business conditions are prohibited.
When we won't be the most precious
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decline in service prices.
In addition, virtually all countries where virtual operators have emerged have tried to prevent more or less classical operators from doing so.
The arguments used by them were practically sensitive - too small, perhaps too complicated, quality service problems, etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulatory authorities, who have never been interested in mobile operators but their customers, have been caught up in these times.
Whether formal measures or non-formal pressure have already resulted in the existence of the first virtual operator and have been charged with another one.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities overrun the whole case as a hot bear.
From our experience, we cannot help but conclude that incompetence in competences is more than appropriate in these cases.
But let's not get a fly into the jelly.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to find out, the Czech mobile market may re-exist.
If one of the operators has allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult to maintain the power of the EOHS to reject (discriminatory) other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling before the rest of Europe.
A new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Choose the best here
Listen to four new versions of Czech state hymns.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek presented the new national hymns of my home on the day of the Czech state.
Hymnu re-enacted the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Ji≈ô√≠ B√©loh≈Ç√°vk.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in the collection and instrumental changes.
The song was taken by Catherine the Queen and Adam Plachetka.
The authors are Father Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The white man views Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech vote that he had chosen to make the solo variants of songs with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular.
"From the beginning I tried both and then the congregation to make sure that they had clear dictionaries so that the text would be well understood in order to find out," he said.
The Czech State Hymna will celebrate the next year 175th anniversary.
The song Where my home was first sung in 1834 at the top of the Stavovs' theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovaƒçka Joseph Kajetan Tila added by Franti≈°ka ≈†kroupa.
She got popular and people took her spontaneously for their own.
After the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first line of song became a natural part of state hymns.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the birth of the Czech Republic itself.
How's "new" hymna?
Prague MHD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
On Wednesday 1 October 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company will be recorded as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and buses, which will take place in the pocket of the electronic coupon instead of the paper.
At this point, he can handle the noise of hundreds of thousands of people who own the Opencard chip card.
Travellers can buy 30-day and 90-day and annual coupons (which will be paid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time leave to play on their chip card in the info centres and workshops of the Transport Company in the stations Museum, Museum, Museum, N√°dra≈æ√≠ Hole≈°ovice, Angel√≠, Roztyly, Latvia, Kobyliss, Rajska garden, Kacherov and Luka.
Purchases can also be purchased from yesterday via the Internet at the Transport Company‚Äôs website www.dpp.cz.
Service in the afternoon was used by over four customers.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget about the exit window in the metro stations where they still had to stand in long fronts on paper trains.
The buyer also buys it over the Internet and plays it on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen parts of the City Library.
"In these places there is a tour with a pre-schooled service that will help stakeholders with online purchases and also replaces their purchased coupon on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opalrny.
According to the book, you will also be able to play electronic shopping on Opencard in self-service cars that are mounted in several metric meters.
How do these cars look?
They are red, they remember the landmark ride and may have seen them on the streets of Roztyly, Budƒõjovik√°, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltovsk√°.
"They are not in the city five, but by the end of the year they should be 80," added the Guardian.
The buyer controls the driver's seat automatically
The service of cars that start working tomorrow is simple.
It's enough to replace the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon is on its own.
Electronic purchases from tomorrow are paid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
So in the direct streets and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, mostly people in the Middle East.
"In railways included in the Prague integrated transport, the train drivers are equipped with read-only cards, which enable them to detect the time and sandy presence of the coupons," Philip Drapal of the Ropid organisation, who forms the railway lines of the Prague mass transport.
Home buses have read-only cards built according to the driver.
It is therefore necessary to show not only the driver's chip card but also to add Opencard to a specific place on the bottom.
The driver shall check the validity of the preserved coupons.
"If it is necessary to verify the validity of preserved coupons, there is nothing stronger than to ask drivers for such information," Drapal added.
Travelers who don't like local buses and who won't remember when they're done with the coupon can express themselves into self-service cars where the coupons are stored on the card.
Here they see information about the availability of their documents on the display of the device.
The Courts wanted to follow the US referendum
In 1945 the Germans applied for the accession of the Shumava to the United States.
It is derived from a letter that is placed in the collections of the South Pacific scientific books.
If we can't be part of Germany or Rakouska, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Germans apparently turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
It also comes out of a letter that was kept in one private archive and is now placed in the collections of the Yihoƒçe Scientific Library.
Germans from the Czech Krumlov ask in a letter to the US President not to allow the return of "shumov's shoes" - banned by Hitler on the basis of the minority agreements - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be absolutely certain that the American units are never coming to Germany as oppressors and enemies, although as freemen," says a letter signed with the words "People who lie in the court of the woods on their hearts."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is likely to give the Germans the judiciary - with the knowledge of Czech national attitudes - only hope for brutality, independence, misunderstanding,
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of the four million citizens, you would have granted this land to a foreign state that is affecting and eliminating minorities and nothing but failure to win the United Nations," writes the letter.
For reasons why authors cannot sign it, it is likely concerned about the pharmacity of "cheese enthusiasts".
If the President of the United States had any doubts about the idea of the Germans, it would be sufficient to arrange a referendum on whether its citizens want to become members of the United States or to live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's news of holiday events, some think it is appropriate to conclude that the expectations of the so - called so - called Germans are valid.
Although the Germans had to at least pretend that they would be expelled from the Republic, only a few of them had allowed themselves to do so.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to unite the Soviets with some kind of autonomy.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Russian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in the Czech Buddhists.
He was in war as a construction German bound for the Baltic Sea.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and put him in a concentration camp in Holstynsk, dozens of other Germans followed him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that when they get home, they'd be honored," said Chalupa.
None of the German employees living in pre-war Czechoslovakia, he said, did not count on the withdrawal from the Republic on the basis of the Beneese Decrees.
You don't think you're paying!
The emotional campaign affects drivers
The most dangerous action is aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history.
However, it would be possible to characterise the emotional media campaign that is leading to the fall of the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of Minister Ale≈°e R√©beƒçka promises that it will appoint a driver from the dangerous behaviour of a volunteer.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, as well as on planes.
She should drive from fast driving and alcohol to the Voltant.
And to remind them that they should be taught before they go out.
He wants to include, in particular, young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and professional drivers in the latter order.
And what's going on?
Mainly human stories that affect emotions.
And that's what the "blood" version of the whole campaign says:
You don't think you're paying!
The word "unthinkable" is written by great letters on the spy.
And in the case of blood, it's the word "you pay."
It's supposed to mean that a person can pay for his own life in a moment of indifference.
The monsters will "fear" until 2010.
The ministry has been able to inspire similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the tragic victims of accidents can often be seen.
It promises that this will reduce the accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
Spots prepared the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and beet on the driver
"The driver pays for the sugar system and the beer.
The sugar for them is that when they go to the red, for example, they save time.
It's a threat to feelings or accidents.
Directors must be at risk," says transport psychologist at Homelce Martin Kor√°n.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and mostly negative ads, psychologists.
They are already less effective according to it tables that warn drivers of danger.
"If a static safety-belt is installed, it is likely soon to sink with the environment and drivers won't be able to hit it," K√∂r√°n warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories by exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government Ehud Olmert spoke for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Mountains, exchanged for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that he published the day after the day after the day.
"We have to go back to the Palestinian agreement, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (recovered) lands, if not all," said Olmert daily.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these lands, but we will have to deal with the Palestinians with a similar percentage (the territory of Israel), because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He allowed the necessary restoration to Jerusalem as well.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem, and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his feet, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to surrender to the part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an assault on two Russian attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites", which is within the Old City.
"Those who want to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed further.
Departure from Golan's heights
Olmert also spoke for Israel's departure from the Golan peaks, which he considers to be an unintended condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also require certain efforts from Damascus.
"I do not intend to close the peace of Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians are well aware of what they will have to give up in order to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (Shitish conquest) Hizballah; they will have to give permanent support to terrorism (Shijish conquest) Hamas, (Terrorist network) Al-Kaydy and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," explained the Prime Minister.
Disadvantaged Questions: Are Stewards illegal in the bus?
The law is unknown, walking in a distant bus cannot
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus by the Student Agency near the Italian Paddy, a question arose as to whether drivers and passengers can travel by bus.
"If we want to adhere strictly and formally to the law, the activity of the stevarda is contrary to the road traffic law," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanselka.
The accident during which a 20-year-old driver died last week caused the bus to cross the road.
At this point, the girl's accident sat next to the driver, at least in a safe place in the car, although she has another two more places.
However, the bus can be dangerous or early to freeze, even when the storm scatters coffee or news.
The role played is whether the bus is equipped with a state-of-the-art position according to the technical test.
If not approved in the bus, the passenger must sit.
Dalka buses Student Agencys do not have parking spaces; what is now confirmed by Radim Jancura's manager.
"We resolved this with the ministry and did not allow the first movement of passengers.
Then we called it off and we got to see that passengers can walk for a ride to the toilet if they have their seating room," he shared his opinion.
The law of the country does not know
"There is no significant legal explanation of the role of stevard - no legal provisions do.
However, no legal provision does or prohibit transporters from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the terms of the vehicle driver; its rights and obligations are not defined," provides less than one-time spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the road transport committee of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the problem of the law is sufficient.
"It depends on whether the bus has a place to stay in approval.
That's the end of it," she says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where there are parking spaces and limited maximum speeds, inter-space parking spaces with higher speed and distance-free parking with maximum speed and seating safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert on transport safety Jaroslav Hor√≠n in the movement of drivers on the bus deck does not see a major problem.
"When driving is very dangerous, the situation can be compared to service in aircraft.
It's not even safe here when turbulence comes and the plane can fit into the head."
"But if he'd get a bus early, of course he'd pay for physical laws.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of drivers must be resolved by internal regulations," he says, "and also minimizes that the problem is not solved by the law.
Jancura is willing to give up services
The Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus carrier.
He's working on them two hundred.
The manager does not consider their call to be a risk even after the accident.
"But as soon as I realize it's a risk call, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and the newspapers can get on the way.
It would save costs," she says.
As an interest in security caused the absence of drivers in their cars, Asian Director Alexei Litvin, who runs a broken line compared to SA.
"We don't have a scarf, we've been standing here since the beginning.
sooner or later it will end with a death sentence," he said a few years ago for Tyden.cz.
It's been a terrible tragedy.
In the accident of a link to Naples, a young man from Plyze≈Ñska who had worked for the company for two years died.
The Slovenian truck probably broke off without using the instructions from the remote bridge and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a foolish manoeuvre, but he took the right front.
In order to produce two places awarded for the rest of the stavards, Jancura refuses.
"This place is not possible to be booked in remote connections, it's blocked."
The company's about to complain about the truck driver.
A girl's family is not going to wait for a court hearing, but the financial reward is expected by the prosecutor.
- Law-making?
Invisible
The clarification of the movement of drivers to the bus deck could bring about a revision of the law on which the thirty-third expert group of the Ministry of Transport is working over the year.
"No specific conclusion has come at all.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the distance and use of the mobile when running," says expert Hor√≠n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of drivers to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes speaker Hanselka with the fact that road safety control is in the hands of police and labour safety authorities.
Hope D√ºsseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the WestLB's letter to the employees of this bank.
The merger of this D√ºsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will result in "the central institution of the financial group dedicated to the sale of capital markets," we read in a letter received on Monday.
WestLB shall, in accordance with the letter to this transaction, introduce "compatibility garden" providing long-term benefits.
And at the same time, such a connection can be an incentive for further association in the banking sector.
Such texts are produced if the presentation is to demonstrate the ability to act within a critical period.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Joint Financial Supervision Office, whose country government's communication in North East and Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still pure.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers are familiar with for its investment funds, and WestLB, however, is still speaking for a longer time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The Head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting half-year economic results at the end of August, has heard that there is no sense in the event of his bank house from Mainzer Landstra√üe with some of the national banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka-Bank Governing Council, which consists of one-half of the Land Bank and one-third of its relations, entrusted the WestLB with the presentation of talks on joint business activities.
It could be about trade on the capital market or their share.
However, the discussions were just beginning, and the financial sector was under way.
Deka-Bank, whose 3000 employees are the most important employees on the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak first in terms of consolidation in the business sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it would be possible to join the Deka-Bank with Landesbank Reheinland-Pfalz and Helaba bank.
There was no end to this triangularity.
Shortly after the plans were made to the public, the Hessen Land Government spoke against the participation of Helaba Bank.
Even the rest of the bank houses didn't agree.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz won Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite repeated speculations about the Deka-Bank connection with the country banks.
Recently, however, G√ºnther Merl, the president of the bank of Helaba, expressed negative concern at the speculation about the connection of his financial home with others.
However, it appears that regardless of this, it is believed that the approach of the various banking houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country's cinema in Bavaria, BayernLB could start to cut ties with Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg.
That's not exactly good news for Helab.
If he should increase pressure on another group, he will gradually come up with potential partners for such a connection.
In the south, only second houses would play, although the financial crisis is far better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The proposal with WestLB again in the beginning of the year prohibited Svaz's Hessen-Th√ºringen bank, which has a 50-percent share in Helab√§.
In view of this, it would look like the least North LB.
This type of geostrategic approach is but one foreign problem.
On the other hand, it is about how much trade models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl announced that the question of what commercial model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, the German Federation has not yet responded to the question.
It could also end with the WestLB distribution, which no one in this institution would of course mind.
It is therefore also mentioned in the letter of the delegation that it is working on "complex solution" for the entire bank house.
Whether or not it will be possible to connect to a combination of individual items with Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "Wend with Italy"
For Ellen it's first, for Luke fourth or fourth.
But this time Elena will be his friend, and then everything will be different, she says.
After them, in the five-literal court of Kaiser's mark, the stronger voyeur stands and two hundred tourists on Octoberfest demonstrate how deep tons can release his throat.
Elena Luc will dance first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bolona.
From here, from the bus park near the port of Nuova this evening, four buses with the name "Destinion Monaco, festa della Birra", scheduled for arrival at 6.30.
Three buses include, in particular, Italy, and in one bus only Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot these Jiho Americans are already singing their flag, they're already celebrating the night.
And so on, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Marks, who has a long cabin with an underpants of the like skin and glow with wide-fibre clothes, belong to the three buses.
For five years he's been driving with them on Octoberfest, only three trips this year.
On the night there, during the day between the stops with beer, at 22.30 a.m., go back.
Nightingday would only mean the remaining costs, says Marco.
The road is 75 euros, including the welcome offer of the Kaiser beer, which has been blocked in accordance with the Bavors' clean beer law, health insurance and German language interpreter - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
The buses go into the night, after the road towards Brennero.
The beer doesn't show up, but it's not yet.
The bus is fast dark, traveling to bed.
They're doing good. They'll still need their strength.
It takes place in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where the number 8 points ahead of Munich makes another stop and a lot of other buses with an Italian identification mark.
When Mark‚Äôs group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwise, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are meeting together, Marco's last show, explains the attack plan.
First: Install a yellow pen.
On it is written "Octoberfest" on the left side of the page by Marco's travel office: "conoscersivijaggingando.it".
The others said, "When they open the door to the drinking-place, run away!" Marco calls in the early air.
"Run!" run and have seats in the back of the apartment.
"Don't go ahead and don't put all the yellow chips on the same lavender, put yourself in the space!"
It's 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget what happened.
"Show your secretaries we're doing the right thing.
When you leave your homes, they are gone."
The third one says, "You'll be back here in half of the 11ths tonight," do you understand?
And up there on Wiesn, a room with beer states.
On the way, one member of the group increases yellow spots as signs of trees, cedules and even on volleyballs one large side of the country.
We need to get ready for the entrance.
As a "Weekday with Italy" I know the second weekend of October.
Detailed information about the number of visitors is not available; it is about 50 thousand people who are on their way through the Alps and enter the blue states, ten percent of all visitors this week came from Italy.
The Minchov police are sending seven police officers from south Tyrol, the Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics, in which Italy before Britain (c. 60 principles) and Rakushana (c. 80), with about 200 medical cures, are the first.
Especially the favorite is Hofbr√ºck's apartment in Italy.
Free Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Last week, the Finance Minister Peer Steinbr√ºck stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy used the word "relatively" and also implied in its statement that the German banking sector would not be spared from crisis development.
'Cause it happened about the weekend.
Indexam Dax followed by a financial house specializing in the financing of the real estate of Hypo Estate (HRE) will be obtained from the German bank‚Äôs consolidated credit pool of several billion on protection against turbulence on markets.
The person concerned told the Reuters agency that the said credit aid would amount to over EUR 35 billion.
The gifts will only have to be paid from real-equipped shares.
The money is derived from private and public banks.
In the back there are the losses of Depfa's daughters.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects on which he had borrowed money, this national financier has been very short-termly refinanced, which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve decreased by 95 % to 2.37 million euros and decreased by 1.6 to 1.45 %.
The normal and net profit from the financial sales of last year‚Äôs turnover was zero, the profit from the increased value of the claim and from certain securities and the cancellation of the reserves for credit trading amounted to more than 70 per cent of the EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher costs for the subsequent recosting costs of the former Depfa group and for the reimbursement of interest under the tax regime and for the mediation of trade for the group companies, the interest rate on the side of the proceeds was still moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financer burned down on mortgages for residents who were then removed from the services portfolio and then led by the Aerial Bank.
Since the classical state funding was too small, Depfa engaged more heavily in infrastructure projects and in the financing of private investors and state joint projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally divested.
From the value of their daughter company, Hypo Real Estate must now have something to write and these letters will have "a major weight effect" on the calculation of profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been left undisputed.
The fact is, the dividend won't be.
It has already been reduced by two thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important financial partner for state and infrastructure projects since taking Depfa.
More than any other institution depends on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, it was practical to raise the threshold of interbank loans because banks are paying liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding funds for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the financial needs of this group are covered by this credit at the time of its adoption and the company is protected "from the impact of international monetary markets at present on significant levels of non-functional functions".
Other sources have been allowed to hear that these funds have been refinancing by the end of 2009.
The President of the HRE Georg Funke, however, announced that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use money markets at that time.
The Bank and the Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now ensured.
That's what the shareholders and bankers hope for.
But in view of the dynamics and inevitability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even excluded that the faith should not be completely destroyed.
However, it cannot be excluded or excluded.
After the bank's late Monday afternoon according to all conditions before the settlement, it can't be predictable, saved to calm you down.
The share rate dropped by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bonds were kept in good condition.
While the priority debt has not been practically eliminated, it has lost the branches of other bonds more prominently.
This relates in particular to the bond between the former W√ºrttemberg Hypo and the logical bond with the period of application after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally appeared to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculants, but their stability is needed after a significant increase in the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which introduced it into the company through the Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less achieved trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the cost of securities in their payment period.
But it can also come to what no one is currently expecting - a financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are currently coming with this partial commitment, there is only a legitimate hope from the likelihood of limiting the certainty.
This is especially likely to prepare a number of long-term believers at night when they decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may at least make use of the threshold to create a transfer of losses from the previous accounting periods to the interest rates of years later for the purpose of future tax on capital gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the crabe bento
When six-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop's first day at high school in Tacibana, girls begin to smile: this German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from Mangan. On her new blog about the exchange of accommodation she tells about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I should've been out of my way to school.
I live in the country of Tokyo on Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the middle of Tacibana.
I had to find my own way. I didn't lose my fortune.
It seems that the start of the study on Taciban isn't as exact as our home in Lower Saxony.
The students begin meeting after eight hours and twenty minutes before the ninth short meeting with the teacher, called 'home room'.
But before I started studying, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, because I'm 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I picked up my old guest mom's dress, to this blouse, blue undercoats and black skin boots.
So I put myself in front of the win and tried to say everything right: 'Saj√≥nar Wo still Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I'm from Germany, and I'm born in a week.
At the time, I was very glad that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 Holes in the class jumped, jumped and had, and I've always heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my gang.
It belongs to the basic Japanese girl's vocabulary needed for survival and means 'stolen, sweet'.
Then I'm going to jump into my place.
The girl laughed quite wide at me, considering it a privilege to sit next to her as a foreign student.
The rest of the hour was relatively calm, but when he called me a gong, I was taken to bed.
They talked one over the other and they asked me about possible and impossible -- and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then they all threw their belts on the stoppers.
My host mother also made me such a cake for dinner - and that's something else than a nuisance German wedding.
I had rice with bees, small beans, salad from corn and rice, fruit and some fish in a pot.
Most of them don't know exactly what I'm doing here in Japan.
These things look special and taste quite new.
It's sure everything's really good.
Well, it's up to the oiled candles, no!
Benta at Japanese schools are not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives the boy a hand-made bet, which in this case is especially artificially adjusted, and hopes that the boy knows each time he stops.
That's what I read in my comic books.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
'Why exactly Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I haven't been able to read manga for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I began to learn Japanese once more.
So I was pretty sure I'd have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
And the cross has feelings.
When a cross or a wedding runs out of danger, does that mean they're afraid too?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how can they make sure they feel the same when they act like us?
The online magazine "Edge" has published the contributions of known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the chosen answer to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other attitudes of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it if we can't even prove that knowledge has other people.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, when we start to hire another type and open matters of opinion or general knowledge, we enter an inappropriate area because the hardware does not agree.
When the cross gets into danger, it'll do what many other animals do: it'll pretend it's dead, deaf or pregnant.
People act the same way some scientists use for comparable subjective survival.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of brain structures facilitate the transfer of our subjective survival to animal survival.
However, this is because guides connected with human consciousness are almost always included in the front front front cortex (because of its short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is much more developed in human beings than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are completely lacking.
At least in these aspects of our knowledge, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature could hide a person‚Äôs language identity: because it is so much his attention is connected with language, it is often said that knowledge depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if knowledge does not depend on language, the language would surely influence it, so that animal knowledge, whatever it is already designed, is likely to differ from most of our knowledge.
So it's hard to find out how it seems to be aware of other animals.
When, like something inside and subjective, it can't even measure, because of a particular hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, it's going to put us in a lot of trouble.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of scientific experience, but there is yet another aspect of knowledge that should be easily accessible.
It would be possible to test animals without regard to their contents in mind, and that is exactly what happens in short-term studies in primary studies, in particular on visualisation.
But this approach called Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses more on the neuronal corlates of knowledge than the causal mechanisms: they may be identical, but they may not be.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of the non-frontal cortex for visualisation.
What's going on?
I export them because the emotional system, like the fear system, is activated in the brain by its own scientific activities.
What we mark as "tresh", then is the mental attitude in which we find ourselves when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its effects as a physical reaction) uses the operational memory.
As seen from this role, feelings of loneliness are carried out with those areas of cortex that are designated to be accepted, especially by people.
In combination with the language nature, there is a pleasant reflection of attention, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize attitudes so that we can join each other.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain stems of committed physical senses, such as Jaak Panxeep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could be able to share in the emotions of many species.
Of course, I can't answer it theoretically, but I think it's inconsistency.
Panxeep argues that what we do in cross and people feel like fear is probably the same: But how can it be verified, says Pankseep, do crosswords and people feel the same when they do the same?
A wedding before danger - does he feel afraid?
From my point of view, it is not just a pattern of behavior that proves the consistency of survival.
It is true that neurological comparison continues to affect us: the cross and people have similar brains, against which there is no brain.
But is the brain's responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to the human being, how would we want to prove it to the cross?
I think the cross and other sharks, maybe even the swab (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to be quite different from those of us (because human knowledge is based on special instruction and language), I prefer emotional behavior rather than mental perception.
In any case, we can wait for progress at the neurological level if we are to measure the gap and the people.
Like I don't look at language and knowledge, I don't look at feelings, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to put this on for a short while, but I'd rather act before I'm back on the wall again.
I'm a real emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: The term of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations will soon direct the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to arrange ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It's not amnesty for our country.
Work has just started and there is much more to do in both countries."
In the timely completion of the time plan, the buildings or buildings of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports are praying.
It's even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is down from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as soon as possible," said the Ukrainian vice president Grigory Surkis.
"The EAFRD will continue to follow us."
Even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
Following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee, the Polish PZPN was called and replaced by independent manager Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister for Sport Miros≈Çaw Drzewick.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," said the Polish Press Agency of PAP.
"The President of UEFA Michel Platiny, we have written to make sure that this step will not put up with the preparation in May 2012. "
A number of teams from the first league were only in the last season due to manipulating due to the forced stage, and eventually it had to be even rapidly moved to the beginning of the league.
Stirred Dennis Quaid back pain
She wanted to make a new movie, talk about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorcer.
That's what he's gonna do. He's gonna get it back.
The slow war is taking place in the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaida: seven years after the divorce of these two Hollywood heroes, they have a bad argument - before the public air.
Meg Ryan first said in his interview for the American magazine InStyle last week: "I've been unfaithful for a long time today, and that was very painful."
She learned about the scope of the subsector until after divorce.
The subject of this mental strip was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a divorced marriage.
Dennis Quaida's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was remarkable: "It's crazy," said a forty-five-year-old herec on New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly overexamines the history of our relationship and manages it."
It's also "political" that Jack's six-year-old son "publicly remembers the pain and radical changes that are for every child's divorce."
While Ryan from divorce is living alone, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father of two.
"My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Cheap flight prices and hotel deals
In the first half of 2008, years and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than I did last year.
In Germany, years were even lower than 50 per cent, according to one recent study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have been re-evaluated - this is the result of the study of the American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and, after the price rise in the first quarter, found their sharp decline in the second quarter.
After several years of price growth in the hotel market, housing in many places has already declined.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of 48 European cities followed by the average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From June to June, however, prices were 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most striking trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than last year.
As a result of this trend, the American Express considers the low rate of dollar that has caused "the fading taste of American tourists to travel".
The price of hotels has also been higher than the industrial centre, such as Hanover, Col√≠n over Rhine or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 per cent by the age of 26.3 per cent even replaced the European record.
In the first quarter, the prices of the flight also showed a still upward trend:
As a result of the erosion of kerosene, passengers in the Economie class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, even 29.2 per cent for long-term long-term flights.
From June to June, the prices of the plane in the Economie class dropped by 12.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, however, in the Business and First-Class classes there were less significant changes in recognition.
In Germany prices have dropped even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, it grew by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter it was 23.6 per cent.
In German national summers, prices even dropped by half, according to a quoted study.
One of the reasons for this price gap is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure on the part of the Open Skies agreement which liberalised the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A significant increase in the number of air carriers, as well as a high number of air carriers, which announced competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 air companies in Europe.
HSV port Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luhukakaka is still unable to establish a functioning unit.
Kristoffer Klein wrote - to increase the uninterrupted accession for the representative of Marco Marina.
This player from Gladbach got involved in the game until later and failed with an explosive balloon.
His message was accurately formulated and cleared out of his mouth convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second hole," said Hermann Rieger on his way to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much done in catacombs, the gap between the ages ended, and most people were sitting in their places again.
Rieger has been HSV physiotherapy for nearly three decades and uses more respect than many temporary actors.
And that's how his request was heard in the place responsible.
Coach Colonel Cornelius Jol touched and pulled his finger on the marks of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of the Chief Coach of Hamburg, Martin Jola.
His order must have sounded the same way: here with the second wave!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look here today at all nice," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
And Bastian Reinhardt would be "be more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgese thank-you-headed Mladen Petrice (11) and the circumstances that very weak Gladbasan couldn't hurt the weak Hamburgans.
"It was a spinal victory," whispered Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV this afternoon celebrates 121 years of its existence.
So on Saturday afternoon the fans celebrated themselves, blue skies over the arena and live an updated table on the video station, where their team was mentioned as a prize.
They'll be born without a regular party.
"We know how to make it right," said Marcell Jansen.
It suggests that the current table result represents more incalculability than its HSV dominants.
With the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silvy, the baker Petrice and the FC Bayern won Jansen - it's just a little late, but it's still not possible to get closer.
"We need more citadel and more tribing," said Jol.
After the vote
There's a lot of fear on Wall Street.
The first report on the drop of the saved package resulted in a drop down of the Down Jones index to 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something else.
About 20.30 showed this world's world's most important bourgeois barometer five percent decline to 10,579 units.
Nasdaq's technology base was more than seven per cent at a minimum of 1548 points.
Most importantly, it was in Dou at this time that the American Express lost about 14 per cent and the Bank of America lost about 12 per cent.
None of the titles could have been strengthened.
Bank shares Goldman Sachs lost almost 10%.
A few days ago he had a major investor Warren Buffett in this company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, funds should be made available for purchases of so-called mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid back in advance, but in a few steps.
Payments should be made to the general public of the financial companies which could be paid in the course of the grant course and which would reduce the burden on the State budget.
Stock exchanges in Europe are falling steadily
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US investors are no doubt free of doubt.
The course of action of the great German banks Hypo Real Estate is very compact and stands with its index Dax.
The U.S. Down Jones index is also lost through the planned financial market.
Spectacular price losses Hypo Real Estate and Commercial Bank dropped the index of German shares (Dax) deeply into the minority.
The share of the aforementioned minority financier of real estate has also been lost by the government and private banks through its savings operations up to three quarters of its value, the Commercial Bank has reached more than 20 per cent.
Dax clearly concluded under the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and with a minimum of 3.7 per cent recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets went down.
In New York he started a business day at Wall Street with great losses.
Investors are afraid that a saved US government package worth $700 billion would not be sufficient for recovery on financial markets.
During the first hour of trade he lost 334 points or 3.3 per cent, which is at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. Snow House has to vote on a rescue plan, the Senate could vote on 1 October.
The other European exchanges were selected by one direction: in London the FTSE index was first reduced by 3.2 per cent, CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, Japan's leading index of Nikkei was closed by 1.26 per cent to 11,743,61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong index of Hang-Seng is 2.1 per cent at 18 286,90 points.
In India, the index of Sensex 506,43 was lost by 3.9 per cent and trade ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAX they lost after notification of an increase in the main name of Arcandor's action.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim recorded 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist company also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook did not sell.
Dark weight affects the years of space probes
For years scientists have not been aware of advice with one striking phenomenon: dark weight affects the speed of space probes during called manoeuvre swing-by (gravitational practice).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity would not be entirely correct.
Nearly 18 years of space probe "Ulysses" flew into the universe.
With the wine of hot water, which will soon freeze, she is now threatened by winter death.
Among scientists for years there is one fascinating phenomenon that causes confusion - anomalies of gravitational work.
Gravitational practice is an aerial manoeuvre of space probes, where they receive additional flexibility in the gravity field of some space body, for example Earth.
That's why the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick just like the solar probe Ulysses.
What scientists have noted for years in this case is amazing: flying bodies are not treated as percent as a person would expect under the old law of gravity.
On the other hand, it comes to irregularities quickly.
Sondy's unexpectedly speeding up or slowing down.
In fact, physics has not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by anomalies of gravity work.
Some experts fear that almost all the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the gravity of the mass of the bleeding space, should not be entirely correct.
American physics Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein did not fail, and is trying to explain the anomaly of gravity work by means of so-called dark masses whose presence in the universe has revealed astronomers.
"The answer to this anomaly could be a dark cloud which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark weights is known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is evidently derived from gravitational force, whose effect on the next universe can be observed.
Rather, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
According to scientists, from this dark mass is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their refugees, it is reported by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs in Egypt that the tourist reenters freedom.
The contributions from the Sudan required a number of millions of euros to be ransomed.
Six hostages were killed when the shooter was fired.
Five Germans were invaded south of Egypt.
The deal on the ransom is already running.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of foreigners.
WELT ONLINE will give you the most important cases.
European tourist attractions on Sahara are all free.
They reported on this in agreement with Egyptian state television, Arab television station Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to a report from the Italian television station Sky TG 24 release, confirmed: "Our public and other hands were released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and eight Egyptian leaders are all right and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already on their way to K√°hir.
The apparent remains behind the shells before the release of the hands: according to the Egyptian security officer, the hostages were prepared to finish the invasion even before the Sudanese army miraculously killed six hostages.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the quoted worker.
It's like "it's just about to take over," when "this surprise" came suddenly.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six hostages and two of them.
The loans were made in Germany for a total of EUR 6 million; the money was to be handed over to a German wife of one of the hands.
The "El Masri El Jom" daily, referring to one of the German mediators, pointed out that the release of arms is coming because foreigners are afraid of their security.
According to this report, the nuns wanted to release the woman‚Äôs hand after paying the ransom.
Men should be kept until the aliens have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to express its report.
The abuse of my father led to suicide.
Several abuses by my father led to the murder of a woman in court.
After he admitted to eight cases of sexual harassment, seventeen-year-old Michael Treris from Stithianus in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The court in Truro heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randlee, had been in regular contact when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a statement.
It was also said that Ms. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was living in Coventry as a child, Trerise would hug her and kiss her eyes and then abuse her sexually, while her mother worked at home.
Trerise divorced his wife in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was announced before the court that Ms. Randle, who had been an essential part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was following a pattern of abuse that was twice a week.
The complainant Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006 friends of Ms. Randle, who had also been deeply involved in surfing and cycling, said that she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She seems to have been married to an Igalitian cat.
Randle stood face to face in the face of his own father, who wrote his daughter's confession, which ended with the words: "I took her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said to him: "You are an extremely strange fetist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim's life.
Even more dangerous is the fact that if she didn't do this, she wouldn't have gotten anything to the court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences of your crime on their daughter in those years," said Stephanie's parents.
"It would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be accused
The BBC was informed that the government official who left the precise secret documents in the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two very secret documents in the train at Waterloo when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were delivered to BBC before the police were handed over.
This is at least a serious violation of that law and does not mean a criminal purpose.
The BBC writer Frank Gardner said this will be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was resolved internally between the ministry and the government authority," he said.
An employee who shall not be appointed shall be charged under section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is a clause for the protection of information.
The prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitical Police officer complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot included the confidential analysis of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision in the morning and was moved from his home to an unknown place.
B&B type-exchangeable face-to-face
The British social base may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after saving Bradford & Bingley's bank.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers in Bradford & Bingley with 14 billion pounds.
These loans will be paid to all companies carrying customer deposits, including 59 companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Societies based (BSA) Adrian Coles said he is "reverent", that he and their members must pay.
The fourteen billion debt will finally be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest rate between them will pay every year all 700 financial companies carrying customer deposits.
The CBC Compensation Plan confirmed that all 59 companies are based on this figure.
It's disturbing that those institutions that were acting as they were... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that were not so serious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay a proportion to the deposits it held and that it had to pay about 18 % of the prices.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the growth rate in 2009 is 450 million pounds.
This means that the basics will have to find 81 million pounds to pay for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of Society-based Business Association, told BBC that he is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is a shame that the institutions that were acting in a significant way during the opening-up of the housing market now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions which were not so significant."
According to BSA, no reliable since 1945, when it appeared, it didn't fall.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what opportunities are available to protect the social base and its members from an account that could be essential," Cole added.
The year 2009 shall cover seven months from the end of the annual meeting to the end of March.
In 2010 the rate will be paid for the entire year and this could be almost twice as much.
In view of the fact that the social base is a shareholding organisation without shareholders, this account will eventually pay its members over higher fees or lower rates on their accounts.
Milk reflects five pounds per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The milkman Jersey announced that from Monday, he would increase the wholesale price of his milk by five cents per litre.
This year, it is the second increase in prices, after double-blind exposure, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect performance at customer prices.
The price of milk from Jersey finally changed in 2002.
Absence for Bangladeshi Expresser
The Bangladeshi court rejected the application of former Prime Minister Shaikh Hasin Vazid's application for the release of the cane, which means that if they return to power, they can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her in connection with the charge that she had received over $50 million (729,700) from a certain firm when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption that have been brought against it.
Chalida Zij√°, a long-standing political rival Shich Hasiny, was released this month on bail.
Shaikh Hasin is going back to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but her side, the League of People (Awami League), has asked her to be first given full freedom by the local army.
Writers say that while she has been released in a fair way so as to be able to take a foreign medical step, it is not clear whether she will stay free until she comes back to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the Supreme Court's regulations now refer to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request by Shajch Hasiny for bail with the fact that he does not need a bail when he is already conducting an investigation released on a fair declaration," her prosecutor Rafique-ul Huk said.
"We appeal against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers said she needed a bath so she could return to the country from abroad because of preparations for the Sunday elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said Shaikh Hasin will be home on 17 October.
It was held last year after the army held by the interim government took too much, but it was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for a medical checkout.
Shaikh Hasina and Chaalida Zijaa both refuse all charges against each other.
Fear of waiting against the back in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in a recent flat-rate look against the backdrop of the Taliban-related violence.
The UN has been expecting in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for safety reasons she could not have access to children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spoke that this happened despite the Taliban's promise that it will not attack or protect thousands of expectant workers.
BSKYB has lost court debate on ITV
BSKYB has been the subject of a court dispute concerning the review of the Commission‚Äôs decision on competition, which the company ordered to reduce its share in the ITV‚Äôs competitive transmission.
BSkyB has shown that its share in ITV is 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission previously announced that part of BSkyB had fought a competitive battle and had a negative impact on ITV.
BSKYB bought part in 2006 in a trade that was therefore prohibited by the NTL company, now referred to as Virgin Media, ITV.
In April 2007, the BSkyB received a share in ITV and called on the Commission for an economic competition to initiate an investigation.
The chief of the Virginia Consortium, Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisations and director Ofcom were all against the purchases.
BSKYB argued that the proposed reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportionate solution - in particular because BSKYB previously said it was willing to issue its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of American lawyers
The US High Representative appointed a special applicant to investigate the release of nine US lawyers in 2006.
This was the case when the report on the case prepared by the High Inspector of Justice of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised the White House officials, the legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was carried out with concern that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The special complainant Nora Dannehy will now examine whether the officials of the hearings during the investigation with a view to measuring justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The important statement, including potential criminal proceedings, was not fully examined or explained."
The appointment of a special complainant with the right to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Ministry of Justice released nine American lawyers in December 2006.
The Ministry then stated that lawyers were released because of poor performance.
However, it was later shown that the release of lawyers was not considered to be higher than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in contacting highly established republican parliamentarians and senators, others refused to investigate complaints of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers investigate and file complaints in court cases under the government.
They may be abandoned at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The toughest head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under the deck and finally gave up.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also declined.
The General Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzalez's role in the case, saying that he did not have "the main responsibility" for failing to "abdicate" from his leadership position and in the act "he did not commit himself very well".
Other officials, including former High Council of Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf will be evaluated
The rock star Meat Loaf will get one of the price Q Awards for its epic Hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
A song that comes at a ceremony next week in London for its special gold price said he was "spoked" with recognition.
The composer, who takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was titled Meat Loof's lead album from 1977.
The nomination for this year is led by the Coldplay group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand on such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The writer, by Jim Steinman, needed a big phone call from Meat Loaf.
She started an instrument part that lasted about two minutes.
The letter was published in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the top of the 15th place.
But Meat Loaff's album Bat Out Of Hell was held in Greek for about nine years and sold it around the world for more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, was also treated for irregular heart rhythms after which he suffered on the floor.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concert.
Later it turned out he had a voicemail.
Scattered streets, often forgotten and possible soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, distances and other earth communications, some famous, other just useful.
But even many taxi drivers and long-term locals have problems when they have to find Extra Place, most of them because they never heard of him.
This small street is in the fourth East Village and leads north from First Street - without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At the width of about ten and a half feet [40 m], he remembers the narrow passage more than the transport bridge.
There are no signs of street names there.
It's practically invisible in the ordinary course.
However, he has a street enthusiast.
For example, Avalon Bay, the developer recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants to redesign Extra Place and create a clean transition to shops and shops that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other surprises are the long-term neighbors who say that they were hit by the street simply because it was one of the last remnants since the block was blocked.
However, the City Agency for the Protection and Development of the Enterprises, which has the streets in its power, has no least interest in it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the general community, the representatives of the city office and the Avalon Bay companies planned to buy a street developer.
However, according to Susan Stetzer, Executive Directors of the General Community 3, the Committee prioritises the option when the streets remain in the hands of the city and requested a new plan which should be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only a very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for correction and management, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to reemerge a small street and set up places to sit, some of which she would use a coffee shop, whose interest in finding a place for the developer is expected.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets was first published at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, speaker of Avalon Bay, said that even if a company wants to use the streets, she doesn't want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to make this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed a city.
Seth Donlin, speaking to the Continuation Authority, said that the city wanted to sell the streets in return, and stressed that his office's task is to develop property better than repair.
Compared with its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left in the history of a soft step.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm named Philip Minthorna was separated from several of his children and on that narrow hill country no one made any money.
To Extra Place, the back door of the CBGB, a Punchrocket monument that was closed in 2006, and the street is probably the most famous photo on the side of the Ramones Alba group "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"There were lots of wastes, scattered clothes and tastes of bars, posters, letters and exercises."
Some local bloggers, including bloggers, who write about facilitating the fourth East Village, object to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that they are buying public property to be hidden so he should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rare - almost unchanged castle of the city which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah√°s of New York's cross-section (with the title "The Book of Nursing: Hot Nostalgic View of the City in the process of measurement"), added part of the story about Extra Place from the section of The City, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dark street, dark even in the day and restricted by the narrow iron doors of the warehouses and closed windows, where the old newspapers spend the week in the streets."
Until a few exceptions seemed like the street of one recent evening completely the same.
Krysa walked through the dark end of the street near the door that led her to the CBGB, where today's trade with expensive clothes stands.
There were graffiti on the roof and there was an empty glass of beer next to the pure doses of sealed newspapers.
Several comets said that the Extra Place meant little, but it suggested that he could get something up there.
On the contrary, Fields said they think that some people appreciate street activity in her current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, wet and hostile places."
Bilinguality debate: English taxation
In this issue, focusing on education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the existence of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a californic academic worker and director of the training team at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "More than you think: why does the middle class need to choose schools".
The effective use of Spanish voters is a complex matter.
The educational agenda of Baracka Obama is just proving it.
The Obama campaign suggests that "Afro-American and Spanish students have a much lower probability that they are studying better than white rats," which is true.
In order to combat such in-depth differences, Obama's educational agenda is particularly "previous bilingual education" for those who learn English first.
The question at Baracka Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on using languages other than English in class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take the example of Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the Los Angeles East.
The tears of this school are in most cases Hispanic cases of low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English first.
However, in state math tests in 2008, the highest level of untrustworthy percentage of fourth-class claims was reached.
Nearly 19 percent of the fourth grade's demands were achieved at the highest level in the national tests in English and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a method other than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street highlights control and training, continuous capacity assessment and free access.
Next, and Obama should be aware of this, according to Lindy Mikkels, director Sixth Street, a pedagogical approach to school for those who are first taught English, "full torment".
The use of English in education is almost emphasised by the use of English in English.
Ms. Michaels, who is against bilingual education, said to me: "We had great success with a completely new jacket from Mexico - after twelve months you'd come into class and don't know what it is."
"It works," she declared, "it works for us."
He would take Obama's school as Sixth Street Prep for a model, how should other schools look with large parts of Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education undermines Obama's commitment to the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently criminalized the matter when he declared that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really prefers to reduce the performance differences, he should think more about the educational models that work more carefully than he does and criminalize them.
Roof of spring due to renewed economic anxiety
On Monday's Monday's prices ended because I fear that neither an American financial market saving plan would be able to revive the economy.
The prices of the termised trades with slavery fell in early trade on New York‚Äôs comedian stock exchanges up to 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday's price was more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, markets with comets have been torn apart by financial disturbances on Wall Street and also by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, the price fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, leading to a massive financial market uncertainty.
The increase rescinded investors on Monday, even after the Congress presidency announced that the agreement on the weekend was reached with regard to the largest saved plan in history.
This report was based on purely concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the most recent phase of the settlement, the government announced that the Citigroup was buying the Banking Division of the Wachavia Corporation.
During the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg government partly succeeded the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts of the Barclays Capital said that the successful weekend conversation that led to the economic recovery plan "has proved to be impossible to revive the market trend".
As the economic situation gets worse, it is expected that the demand for comedites, including roaches, will decline.
"The market prospects for global shares, rates and exchange rates have been very low," researchers from Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that comedites will not be able to avoid orders.
From a comedy perspective, our greatest concern is to what extent an American virus spreads around the world and in particular to China."
Analysts of these banks have lost their expectations for the next year, as the consumption of oil has decreased due to the lower economic growth and reduced their forecast prices of petrol by about 20% for 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter won the team record.
After he spent his last eight season in the Jets drawing more than anyone else, defense player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter where Jets changed the safe game in Spanish driving.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and the arisonists of Cardinals were able to make their dirty game up to the nightmares over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Fabre sent Laveranue Colese to a 12-year-old touchdown sprint, which perfectly changed the afternoon in which their progressive development cooperation moved forward a thousand years ago.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter behind the other two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell back and another 10 seconds before half-life.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Fabre about all his Coles' toys.
"It's a fucking good player.
It has been very good to communicate with us, so that people can think of anything."
While Favre and Cole were housed, the defense broke into Cardinals Kurta Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the wrong walk and brought it back 32 yards on touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith type another match and catch it.
Linebacker David Bowens Donutil Warnera k fumblu.
The last loss of the sword, the fumble that Bowens used, may have been the best.
The Cardinals got to the game 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, the Jay Feely dug a 20-year-old hole from the field where he got the lead 34-0.
It's the best thing that Jets got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe this madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets were allowed on the third quarter of 21 points without answering - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than this third.
A lot of points have fallen in a short time."
The Original Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselasie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him to be the best long runner even when on Sunday in Berlin maraton he won his own world record and became the first person to run 26.2 miles a long race under two hours and four minutes.
Winning a pleasant flat track in time 2:03:59 translated in 27 seconds its previous time 2:04:26, which escaped last year in Berlin.
Gibraltar, which is 35, has created the 26th world record of its career, which is really incredibly wide - convinces the world record or is at least the world's master at all distance from metric mile after maraton.
Last month, Gebreselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because fear - from a retrospective look may be too frightening - that the polluted air will expose its problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees in the target - he won Sunday in Gibraltar with a bright average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What happened to runners like Gebreselasse and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a further route, closed the marathon record in the last decade of more than two minutes, since the time Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After a week of winning, Gebreselasie told the journalists that he had two weeks ago screamed in the air and left the train for a week.
The stop apparently woke him up more than she kept.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselasie to the reporters.
"It was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little suspicious today, but it was all right."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the East African Rival of Ethiopia - because he planned his careers in advance, generally fled from the world marathons, relied on the guide as if it were a race on the road, and set up world records on the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can be difficult to reduce the size of Gibraltar's run-off quality.
Keeped in time four Kenya reached the half-life of Gibraltar at 1:02:04.
After the leaders disappeared, two elite Kenyans, James Kambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to chase the Gebreselassian.
About something before three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie finally took and fled to Kambai, who then fled to the second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum in about five minutes.
Kamathi ended the third time at 2:07:48.
In the race, the woman finished the seventh most recent year of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit√°nkov√°, a parent from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Sixteen-year-old Mikit√°nk's surprise won a race in London marathon at 2:24:14.
Peking games stopped because of something that was described as an injury behind, but she smoked and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ran to improve her personal maximum in about five minutes.
She ran a race of wisdom and thought: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run into a large race and then she reached about 18 1‚ÅÑ2 miles [2 1‚ÅÑ2 km].
Ashkele Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ran the second at 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya ended the third time at 2:25:01.
Hungry and blockage of the lives of the blacks in a separate city
Hidden between the various entertainment parks of the larger Orlando, several miles from all the beautiful, luxurious and decorated, lies a quiet city in which the pride and order of the African American life live.
Eatonville, the first complete black city to be included in the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent his childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three crochet playgrounds, three hundred snowflakes, three hundred good blues, supply of quays, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a quiet place.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to make a gift from Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains on the side, although it has made a stop for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It's still as independent, competent and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that outside blacks in Florida often disappeared and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows us so little or no about what is coming."
Even today, in the year when the Montenegrin Presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of races, many more experienced citizens remain cautious about foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story is being told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the city's oldest charity.
"It must be right."
Eatonville was long characterised as a triumphal paradox.
It's like a historical model of black rise, so the community is almost 2400 people, where poverty is twice the size of the global average.
It is a medium-sized literature, but also deep-rooted by the example of South American foreign black culture - sometimes rejected, sometimes praised - which came from American childhood.
It's not too surprising that the older citizens are both proud, so protective.
And the concerns about Eatonville's performance really started to get to Zoro, which is the only way that Horston's name is here.
She presented her home to the world through her heartless books full of words such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide have changed the city of Kousek to road No. 17, which leads through the often-limited center of Florida, in the course of black history and human drama.
With the outbreak of a big bubn in life and literature, Hurston‚Äôs reader led into the trade of the first Eatonville old Joe Clark and then back to his personal places.
"On the left by the road," she wrote, "it's a very beautiful, modern national school with well maintained courts and games that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write too much."
She also mentioned the new widow of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "proselytizes all kinds of drinks and even anything that belongs to an hour hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville declared himself self-restraint, but also with apathy, rediscovering of drawings and sex.
This was obviously not the typical control of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it as it was," says Nineteen-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortals by citing men who sang simple songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Horston is still remembered here as a Cypriot center, which often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventeen - year - old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of her arrival in the city came without notice in the vast Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is even worse for adequate clothing.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were worried.
"People like to see Zoru all the time," said Franklin.
But, he added, he jumped on his seat on the back terrace looking at Sabelia Island, where Hurston's greatest probability of being baptized, "it's never been too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were printed.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten her together with the rest of the world.
Although it was once a literary star, the contemporary Langstone Hughes and the only black one at the Barnard College in the twentieth century, it was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florida Fort Pierce, where she had lived before.
In Eatonville there were no larger mourning devices or large public readings.
"I think they didn't even understand its meaning for the world or its reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s in the 20th century.
Representatives of the Orange County period wanted to take over the city five-way distance instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
The Orland explosion has already crossed the national border No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting from a complex historical period.
The forced integration, together with other things, ended relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 20th century, the fight against racial discrimination has brought hatred to the Community‚Äôs attention.
"At that time, a party of white boys, they came and ate the dying and stuff on people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a woman who killed it.
They walked out of the car melon."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston's request to the Supreme Court for forced integration and his decision in Brown's case against the education room announced that "for my race it is more offensive than for me to celebrate."
The population now claims that the disaggregation of the school, although in some areas it was positive, has reduced the sustainability of Eatonville and undermining the youth‚Äôs fears.
"The Black Children were used to vows - I remember that - you two your teacher in the morning, you two your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathario, daughter Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Zachranjte Eatonville Community).
It lasted until the teachers and the nuns left the same place.
"You don't care about your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, civil law has helped to create a space for many more Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, priests and artists who as she was raised above the prejudices with ease of mind and quotes as an example "How can someone overcome the love of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975 she took Alice Walker to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began fighting to revive her story.
Five years later, he came to the police in bookshops, a well-known biography by Robert E. Hemenwaye, who reorganized it into the American canon.
The project with the distance reached just when the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the light of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now viewed her as a savior.
To show what can happen to its distant destruction, the community began planning the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural action two years later, and each winter many return to the festival.
The state came up after a couple of years from a remote proposal.
"These five rivers have emerged from the distance, you would say that they have fired directly, a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd's just said, "The star saved Eatonville."
The victory over the remote project helped change the city's image.
In addition to such places as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to go to the church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and citizens began to reexamine the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical record in 1998.
The new single-pattern book (of course after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the once-populated and enriched Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a florid anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a western street in the rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today is 90% black.)
Foreigners who come looking for the story and the significance of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
The permission for most of the talks is necessary to have ahead and certain things - such as walled paintings in the oldest Eatonville church that have painted whites and depicting blacks in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as Hurston's festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Horston saw his entire race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, employed, traveling and diverse as other American races and ethnic groups.
From the voice of Franklin's son, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, she expresses sincere love for the village when she plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police who says she would enjoy some help.
And even younger ones, such as a eleven-year-old couple from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonov, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just eat here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at the moment in history, it's a very nice place."
Here in New York, we're all talking in cash.
Nothing's changed in the first place.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the news stations and TV shows on Times Square, they would not know they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that, in an unprecedented role played by the offices over their heads, they have every day bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Followers keep counting truck trucks along the way and transport muffin packs to breakfast meeting.
The Spaniards continue to cross between the bears and wear, like human mules, down to the tens of scattered goats hanging from their backs.
The office crossings are still waiting in front of their early baggage in street dining rooms, and it is still not possible to arrive on every day of the yellow taxi between Thursday and Saturday.
It didn't seem like a crisis, until I decided to base myself on the fourth half of the matching account with all the things about pessimism.
Although I took this task to cover up with my late afternoon system on my local JP Morgan Chase, there were about twenty people waiting at the front.
Not before the warehouse windows to find out or put out the equipment, but before the crossing where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask themselves about the trade with Macy's mixed goods and new customers book accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Star, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
However, they have already chosen me from smaller banks in places where they came from, for example, New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called trophys (a little like construction contractors), money companies and those types that operate only in one state, who claim to care for their customers as family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have broken down.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went to competition, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets of $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The staff of the offices and shops who stood before me and were afraid of another coup moved their readiness to the bank, which is considered a safe haven and which makes most of the storage on Wall Street.
In the last week, ordinary New Yorkers learned to be fluently financial.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that corrupt bank, and to her lost senior executive officer Dick Fuld with family ties, such as if she was arguing about her colleague's line.
And Lynn, a uniformed half-year-old junkie at my cousin's home, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food records.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the funds of the money market.
I moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Muslims' graves are destroyed after the cancer of the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Democratic People's Republic of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian Legal Party Vlaams Belang, was present in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "City Against Islam".
They are not the same as the transport marks that reflect the mixes of cross-brown red.
The police charge legal extremism from the overcrowding of the Muslim massacre in Rakouska on the same weekend where extreme legal parties have achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 graveyards on the ground in Traun near Linze were once between the Friday evening and this morning the police were severely destroyed and the police were convinced that it was an organized action.
The culprits supported some of the Jewish symbols, such as David‚Äôs star, but detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident was ever brought about by the elections.
Talkers from the Muslim communities said that they are "deeply shocked" by reports of overcrowding that are coming at the time when they are approaching the end of the Muslim post-Muslim month of Ramadan.
At the same time, Rakousko enters the car to look for his own soul after the transport has been completed in the previous parliamentary elections.
Both national legal parties, which have received more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Free and Soviet parties for the future of Rakouska, have carried out a campaign against immigration and some of their elements have been considered critical as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the President of the Free Party, who received more than 18 per cent of the votes, protested against rats and pigs in the campaign and even expressed his support for food in which Islam was closely linked.
At his last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke about "European fraternity", which should prevent access to Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of museums and mines and argue that these are political symbols of Islam in Rakouska and Europe.
Studies and analyses carried out immediately after elections which have placed extreme rights to the most powerful political blockage in the country indicate that this change has been caused by, in particular, young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter can't travel beyond the border
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was judged to be sexually abused children, forbade the court to travel to France and Spain.
The authorities imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that it is planning to travel across France to Spain.
This travel ban was approved by the Kent Police last Thursday after it was submitted to officials evidence of Glitter's previous sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, his own name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing of Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but he was represented by lawmakers from Corker Binning.
The Court of Justice said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kenyan police requested a regulation which would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not participate personally."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he had first gone to a foreign country, how he would have a record of sexual assaults.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week before.
If the obligation to inform the authorities has been mentioned, he may be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police announced that it would not be able to conduct individual cases of possible Glitter journeys over the period.
"The Kent Police will do everything they need to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who will stay in Britain because we have extensive systems that control potential risks more effectively.
Protecting Kent's citizens is the highest priority for the Kenyan police and we work hard to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual attackers, thus reducing any risk to the public at least."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for using two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to travel to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials were on his way back to Britain.
On 22 August he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in western London and, at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was once imprisoned in the United Kingdom for the possession of child pornography for four months.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and glad that Glitter was banned on his journey to France and Spain.
"To get a real character, by photo of the mystery outside the scene." G√ºnther Bauer - photographer
No flooring, no bells or costumes.
Only the essence of the great professors of flamenca, who responded from the point of view of interpretation - only with the aim of a free expression for men or women.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, man.
Undecided, if we mention privately, at those moments away from the public - then you can see a reliable gesture, a deep summer of captured vision or your hand gesture with your hands which are not old because they are unable to appear on the scene.
German G√ºnther Bauer is playing in the "Flamenco-people" theatre with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less-known face of masters.
To this end, the photographer consists of the unique iconography of the flamenca from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the month of the photograph of flamenca (Mes de la Fotograf√≠a Flamenca), "represents the growing international significance of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people's portraits "on the street" are artists capable of passing on the scene with excitement, sadness, joy... and totally glamouring.
There is no need to take photos of these artists.
She wears her personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of the flamingos.
At the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer started a long career in the portrait of flamen singers, guitarists and dancers on the disco camera in 1997.
These are portraits that remind you of the classic photograph by means of the choice of camera and material.
The use of different stylistic means is in conflict with the classic basis of the picture and gives it a contemporary spirit, which, according to Bauer himself, is the idea of a flamenco: "Hungry with very traditional roots, which but does not cease to surprise and develop."
What's going on is not the effect of the dance itself, the song or the game, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most honorable one, with the spirit that appears in the way of attention, stay and experience, was and is the constant work presented during these days in the El Photomat gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists creates famous flamenca posts, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosov√°, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like flamenca‚Äôs anthology and soon came to the book release, which will contain exhibition portraits.
The training for portraits led Bauer to the idea of returning to the "Sportreichs of SportARTProject" two years ago.
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, photographers assume that "photostos people, to know them and have the opportunity to get into their lives at once, whether longer or only short, it's my pleasure.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in the picture.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities who never know, or give him a few minutes to focus.
Despite similar circumstances, I always try to realize my ideas as a photographer."
A collection of portraits of the modern flamenca called "Flamenco-people" is presented in El Photomata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, similar to Alamedo de Hercules, and it is possible to visit it until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he wrote was "trophylaxis"
He plays in an environment that he doesn't know yet, and reports about events for unknowns, although Mario Vargas Llosa is able to successfully implement his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casamant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for 20 years and traveled to the Amazon.
A great favorite Nobel's literary prices yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival acknowledged that the project he is working on is "trophy" and that "all testifies that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had any reason, I wouldn't have done it, but I do it and I believe I'll finish it once," he concluded his contribution to the event of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he spent in the city of waterwater around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main features of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award for Hay Festival for the most popular writer - the old Dickens edition "Our mutual friend" - filled the theatre with Juan Bravo to the last place.
With F√©lix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a vengeful audience whose hour ran like water - a Peruvian with great precision and a necessary dose of humour, recalled how he was reminded of the original "unbelievable welfare" from "satisfying his readers" and from "the power to live more than I have ever lived"; how he adds "not enough inspiration" by writing "discriminately", clearly quoting text, correcting and rewriting; or how his writings Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas were affected by "the joy of his readers" and what "rememory images" were his nuance.
The Spanish novelist admitted that "there is no way," how to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, boring experience" - Vargas Llos stressed that "to people it is a way" and "to try to get out of line," and called the writers "not to worry about" and "to take responsibility" for their mission.
Due to climateology losing popularity in Pozoblanca - missing copies
The meeting with copies that closed the celebration in Pozoblanca was canceled yesterday morning after the announcement of the effects that the surface of the site is not in good condition.
That is why the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonard Hern√°ndez, decided to cancel the arrangements.
Unreliable weather conditions of this festival are long behind which two out of three celebrations have been unable to be realized.
On Saturday, he couldn't get the rain of other planned wild game.
During their formation, Jos√© Luis Moreno, Curro D√≠az and Juan Bautista were to be placed in an arena on Castilblanca.
That's how it was, but it was only Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who set up three ears and rewarded for dynamic and aesthetic quality performance on the shoulder.
On the same day on the other day, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two copies for health and one ear that even brought him an uncovered seat in the arena than Toreador art.
Even worse, El Juli, who had gone through the arena of Los Llanos, was unsanctified.
In the second round without one breath, he served a strict criticism from most of his contemporaries.
Controls were taken in √Ålva in the supplier with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes. Five minutes.
Ertzaintza railway control in the city of Armin√ºn√≥n (√Ölava).
The consignee shall stop two persons coming into the supplier and they shall eat them.
By the way, more than two tons of hashish is not to stop.
According to a report from the Committee of the Interior of the Basque Government, the officials pursued and maintained one of the suppliers, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
He was charged with drug trafficking and the falsification of State documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit conducted road control at N-1 in places where the borders of the city of Arminj√≥n are crossed.
They wanted to stop the supply for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, rushed forward and caught.
The passengers began to arrive right away when the vehicle stopped at the edge of a few miles away, at this time the two passengers jumped up and ran into the forest.
At the end of one of them, the Ertzaintzy staff finally agreed and enjoyed 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects carried as they walked away during the inspection of the delivery of Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was packed with hashish packages which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug assessment.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark was "damaged" and did not agree with the information contained in the supply documents, which was therefore also accused of falsifying State documents.
Ertzaintza continues his search for a second suspect, which, as already mentioned, has been able to recover so that it can finally determine the origin of drugs.
A. A. J., 28 years old, has been transferred to the police department to establish appropriate formalities before further examination is made.
Hereshka Heather Lockler is held for driving under the influence of medications
Here Heather Lockler, a beloved Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was held this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform extraordinary manoeuvres when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, he sent people‚Äôs magazine to speak California - speaking drivers.
She explained that about 16.30 o'clock. Lockleair's "sudden went to the floor, walked forward and back through the mud and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times she passed the sunglasses when she hit him."
A witness who didn't know the heretic according to the first thing, saw Locklear's moment after he stopped on the other side of the road and left the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "she had fear of Lockler's life".
When the police officer arrived at the scene, she found a heretic inside the vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"It looked disoriented," and therefore its staff took it to a specialized drug and alcohol centre to give a detailed test.
According to the police speaker, he worked together and too much alcohol was withdrawn, although "we think Lockler was under the influence of some medicines that were for the guards at first sight".
Lockler was detained for suspected adverse effects of treatment near the specified substance and approximately 19 o‚Äôclock was taken into custody even though it had been released several hours later.
Two months ago Lockler returned from the treatment clinic, where he recovered from depressive conditions and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian IU to exercise its powers in the case of Silva
The Head of the IU and the Ambassador for the United Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sport Committee in Seville Francisco Manuela Silvy, who left the office last week after being accused of meeting in the interests of his family, will depend on the national association of the party.
"I am a very federalist, I am on an Andalusian organisation to exercise my power," Llamazares said in his agreement to which the party will have to go in relation to the former member of the City Council.
However, the chief of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation of illegal behaviour that Silva had allowed himself to do, it is absolutely necessary "transparentity": "IU has always struggled to make such matters more transparent."
Similarly, he stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Blood blood" ('Sangre de Mayo'), the epicalcium Garci
Jos√© Luis Garci, who was inspired by the episodes of the national past of Benita P√©rez Gald√≥s, reminiscent of the Spanish revolt against the French - is one of the most unambiguous film in his film with about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "increase the clarity of the position and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paul Echevarr√≠a during the presentation of the film before a large group of performers.
The flower blood with metrics over two and a half hours will be introduced into the kine this Friday and in the future it will reach more than four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of Gald√≥s Jos√© Luis Garci's literary works, he said that by making this film "a child's dream", which Esperanza Aguirrre, who believed him three years ago for the autonomous province of Madrid, believed that the photo was directed to the second anniversary of Madrid on May 2nd, he accepted the offer that the event will come out of the episode of the national past.
The figure of 15 million, which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means for Garci's "one chance" to create an environment with bullets and costumes corresponding to the image of "a third Spanish who has been forced to fight for whom - the fight for independence led the government of Ferdinand VII to fall and the rest of the country," he said.
The director, however, regrets that he could not count on the financial support that he received from films The sad wing (Ala sade) or Goy's visions - almost a dozen flowers' blood - could not find any scenes from the scene signed by Horacio Valc√°rcel, with which he works almost throughout his film drive.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as usual - on a stage with the hero who usually does not choose castinje before the attack, because it belongs to "lower" and is also thought to "participate the director's call is to go to the theater and kin and find out what's going on in the order that's going on".
Many priests who have chosen for the blood of the Flower are already appearing before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rell√°n, Carlos Larra√±aga or Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations on Oscar, one of which was obtained, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the single Flower Blood, the Seven Tables of the French Billion and the last selected blind Sunday, do not represent a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "this is just happening".
There's no evaluation expected for this film, Garci.
"At first you think you're working for what's going to happen, but then you realize you're only working for training, and then you're gonna be allowed to do one more movie," explains Garcia with more than 30 years' career.
Isabel Bayon's spiritual relationship with the city dancer Tortoly Valencian
Sevilll dancer Flamenca makes a hold of other Sville dancers.
Carmen Tortola Valencian, father of Catal√°nce (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and mother Andalusanky (Georgia Valencia Valencianzuela), was born in the fourth Triana, and when she was three years old, she moved with her family to London.
The modern dance dance and focused on the Oriental dance.
She lived a full life, she was a promiscuous female emancipation such as Isodora Duncan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for breaking up a corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman was influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of medieval Europe by Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this position -- it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "he's not about justifying his life, but about saving the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenca rhythms.
So "the dance of molluscs" called me Guajir or "the dance of hada" some tang.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic is also the answer," she says.
The presentation is composed of two outstanding characters: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel in one performance as in "Open Doors" (La porta abierta), and the teacher of the dance Matilda Coralov, who made an exception and joined her former jacket.
"Matilde represents the older Tortoul, a mature position.
I'm glad she accepted an offer to share in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The presentation also includes music and guitars by Jesue Torrese and Paca Ariagy, by Miguel Ortegy, El Pulgy and Moi de Mor√≥n; by bubny El P√°jara, by Rafa El Violy and by the cooperation of Herpe Juanfry Ju√°rez, "who has the role of the eternal director of this kind of art, who are primadonists with everyone and who are always in love with them".
It also takes into account the life of this woman who played in her time at such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and throughout Europe because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she was one of the women who have had a major influence at some point, but today no one knows her and still less appreciates her creation," says Bayon.
The show starts today at 20.30 in the Lope de Vegy theatre.
The book "The Women's Day" closes and triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Virgin of Women" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez closed the manuscript with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme of the coordinated cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government at the celebration of "Tren√°le Zenobie and Juana Ram√≥n" (2006-2008), which aims to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the year of their death.
The "Tren√°nale Zenobie and Juana Ramona" will end up with the new publication of this work, the international convention to be held in New York, the construction of the Nobel Museum and the tour exhibition "Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez: Onen Paprusk sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after enjoying various Andalusian provinces, it should be moved to New York in accordance with the plans at the time of the holding of the convention.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also ordered eight copies of the "Pedrem Tabernacle of Women" edited by Pedrem Tabererem and illustrated by Jacob P√©rez-Encis to continue to spread knowledge of the identity and part of one of the world's largest Andalusian poets.
America doesn't like Paul Newman so much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the heretic Sally Field who worked with him on "No evil idea" and under the silent knowledge that Newman left, he rejects his unhappy vision of abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look at how it took them before Oscar got it.
And he's been in debt since 2007.
And that he knew he was seriously ill.
And yet he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a man feels can't express in any way, and now I've lost a big friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid he'd be funny or upset.
The father of the film and the authorities died in particular a dark period of fear from terrorists and financial markets, when the American consciousness is on the day when hope is looking for reasons for pride.
When the time is harsh and people are rude and only those who stand up for your admiration - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official envoy of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and rescued cases, from the charge of drug addiction based on the honour of the first-born son who died of overdose until after his home food and biofood.
A full fund for a country that has continued to work hard to break free from a self-sustaining fear - inspiring culture.
The bourgeois wool wonder of Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that one man didn't die, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, who held Oscar for the Sam Mendes regime, said that working with Newman was without any supervision at the top of his career.
The evil hero from Australia, Russell Crowe, was able to mark Newman for his greatest source of inspiration.
"This slipper has given all of us a beautiful high spot," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the little ones who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman - is based on motivation and leads a serious private life away from the camera.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luck is such people and Paul Newman is their model.
He got divorced once, and since then he's been married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunity to be.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I have a home file?" I like to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven that on earth he rules between his daughters and admirers - it's not too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he has performed, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a victim of the Philanthropist."
Unfavourable Olympic Games in Madrid
Yes, many of us are worried that the Olympics will take place in Madrid, and after the year 2012 it may be 2016.
But I'm wondering, are we ready?
If we run a race yesterday, I say no!
It talked about him as a perfect race, and my court said he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a lack of sense that if it came to the evaluation and I were trying, it would be clear that it would not be enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty each other.
Disagreements begin with the issue of a racing number for which a person has to express himself in advance.
I don't think that's bad, but when a man goes there, he gets everything (including a guy who's got to go over the road).
But no.
Here man had to pick up the number first (first meaning, go there only because of it) and (after the proper front) - what a surprise! - they only had a trick of size S (second meaning because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy just a little trick because it's less stuff and they're cheaper?
All right, these are small compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the front on it lasted more than 15 minutes, he had to get his boots back there.
Over 35 minutes was waiting, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected to have something inconceivable.
So, as it was expected, the race started and we didn't even put up a fight, and when it happened, it was much worse.
In addition, the waiting lasted for 40 minutes, leading to the general construction and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have to take a shower tomorrow and someone like me doesn't seem to have the right time to evaluate the results for the guy who gave me and who, as I suppose, didn't tell me the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, this wouldn't have hit me.
And so I think we're gonna have to let ourselves look like a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft searches for reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented another development in the new system of recognition of image and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent but capable of carrying out basic actions such as calling for taxis (or in the case of Microsoft, a sequence that would move around the whole area of society) and taking into account what they hear in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and system that recognises the shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they have on themselves - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It is also able to divide the present according to the conversion groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist notes third parties and understands that they are not part of the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going after someone and she tells her she'll be hired in a minute.
That's all without a blue screen of death.
That's great.
But of course it's a future song.
Now the company has more important things to do, for example a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week there was a lot of talk about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and they won't have so many connected programs.
Steve Ballmer came to the point that if computers had only the most necessary, without competition for commercial interests, they would be five times more efficient - human, Steve, they would certainly be cheaper.
Discover as a game when we consider that Microsoft version of the version adds new features to Windows and another extra.
A change of direction would be a good thing.
Microsoft has the truth, the operating system is a little lossy and it's similar to that software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the site, I became one of those who insist on the theory that it was the first step in Googlu's competition with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because this is the kind of understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the Chinese.
That's the truth.
It never disappears, but it's necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not like absolute truth, but relative truth.
What he said this week, Ballmer, confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and to more web browsers.
The computer stops to let Firefox or Explorer down - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around the window.
What are half of the applications running the system?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less complicated, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Googlu.
Trust me, they need it, and I have a little example here.
I did this photo in one restroom for Microsoft's staff in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinking machine was a poster that is requested to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees were used for Google‚Äôs online search.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It's not going to start in 2009, but at the end, we'd rather count by 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is getting as far as the computer goes.
Because Android and iPhone are already on the market, they're gonna have to pay for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore him on the Azoro coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the "Blood Diamond" in Edward Zwicka, like Al Pacino in "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniforms of the gay community.
And if we want to go to the count of his life roles, we can boast up to the image of a typical celebrity with a handsome priest who stirs up the action in the chariot circle.
In essence, it's nothing more than a typical pang-shaped, touch-free and hand-free underpants.
English-speaking people call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels results over all the others.
For the first time for his bloody name - even when people call him 'Marcel' - which is related to sport because, as legend says, was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lovers of the song editor Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' is the result of other quality cotton, unisex fabric, a distinctive label and (almost unknown) Belgian haircut, which have models of non-emblemmaticating tissues as detail in the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize only on tank tops.
It also manufactures makeup colleges, retro boxers, cassette lights, steaming calhodes, sea tripods, clothes for children, mini shorts...
Built-in cuts for comfortable underwear.
Even though it's a shame that they're just undercover.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
The romantic interest shown by her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, even though she's a little girl, is a woman full of life.
The sisters of Cruz are taking their new turn in fashion now very seriously.
For M√≥nica it means much more than that some pretty, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, a promotional action was organized by Mango in its new seat, including a statement of the most significant modal prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
He's heartless and unmovable, and he's near to get you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I wanted to introduce a new collection that we had with Sister Penelope for Mango at the year-long South-South season, and at the same time I participated in the second anniversary of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in the Opera for Valentine.
So it was exciting, but at the same time, it was a day of resurrection.
What's your new collection for Mango company that you're already working for in the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the '50s and '60s, and we've got a lot of business.
I'm also very happy with tortoise around the city and watching women walk dressed, how they combine and sort their clothes, I do very often.
You're a dancer, you're a hero, you're a poet, so you're a very strange woman, aren't you?
I think it's true, but the end of it all is interconnected and has a lot of connection.
I must have liked my clothes right away, I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house, sit in my aunt's closet and watch her dress.
It was a sense, almost better than going to a holiday.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to care about how I was dressed.
However, you know that we dancers rely on how we manage to make ourselves feel good in our own hours and trials of looking at the mirror.
And like a heretic, when they give you your costume, then you really break into the building.
So it's all connected, but with great respect for designers and professionals.
You've recently had 30. You've had a crisis?
Where are you going?
I'm feeling better than ever before. I'm having a triad of fun.
I find that a woman is ready, has experience, and lives are going through less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I just do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body needs it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to lose it.
If it's about my father, I don't care about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I'll give my child a feeling of happiness and I'll treat him with great love.
If it's about the movie, you're gonna be waiting for a couple of film princes you've got on the line.
That's right, and I'm glad they're coming to China.
I'm coming from a wonderful world, so I'm very impatient and calm, and I want everything right now and I don't think it's going to happen.
I like the prime minister "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the tomb of Christ".
I'm glad you're gonna like...
A few days ago, you had your prime minister on the scene next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step on my foot like a model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in the beneficial views for her organization "Women for Better Life", and the clothes we have provided - I have also chosen two models from our collection for Mango - and the competition has been presented to Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
It's a lot of things about her and I, since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm going to keep up with what's going on.
She asked me to introduce myself for charity purposes, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
I'll do what the women of the third world need.
Repeated access to alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires the driver to install in his car a system that prevents him from driving in a service or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has become known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project which takes one year.
Its purpose is to return drivers as volunteers, so drivers will also have to complete the course of transportation.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, this experience will be shared by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Technology System for Vehicle Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of the car drivers charged more than once for the operation in the airport are again in this condition as a volunteer.
Alcolock should avoid this because it is a system connected to a vehicle which measures the coldness of alcohol in the air and prevents the start of a car if the driver is not breathing before or if it is marked higher than the permitted alcohol concentration.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and he would have to pay for it himself.
A study carried out in this sense in the United States in 2007 showed that 65 % of the traffic in vehicles equipped with this equipment decreased during the first year since its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that each year 115 people could be saved.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it is brought to justice.
In order to assist in its implementation, since legal correction can be carried out in an ordinary way, the necessary correction of criminal provisions is required, however, to amend the law.
The facility is still not available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though it has already been tested in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
The Congress of Members will be voting on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as still in the program, Benita Ju√°rez Airport, Mexico D. F., landed at the presidential hangar at the Spanish Air Force Airport, where a prince and princess from Asturias arrived.
The sun just fell, however, his paper was still forced to close his eyes so that he could see the next couple coming out of the plane.
Under the roof was a Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver if he knew that a Spanish prince with the princess was coming to the state visit.
- Yeah, so it's great, it won't get to the airport to pick up people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's a Spanish, but she's been here for a few years.
- Yeah, so it's...
The Mexican press, however, well knows who are Prince and Princess of Asturia and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red deck and the military cordon, which makes 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot a fair saloon.
The prince appears with smiles on his cheeks in dark blue and princessy, very middle dressed and with loose hair, has no ordinary "peeptoes", apparently told her that in D. F. the storm is dangerous.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they laugh at the photographs and don't bother them.
At the hotel's doors, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Best added fashion price
It is probably not the most suitable place in the world to express the fashion price than Paris and is probably not the most famous design and awarded to Valentino.
The company Mango just announced the second anniversary of El Bot√≥n-Mango Fashion Awards in order to enable the international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price is paid by EUR 300 000.
Belgium's Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first anniversary, looked at her proposals in Manga exhibition at the Parish Boulevard Housesmann number 54 and almost cried for help yesterday.
Of course, this is the second largest business of this company in Europe and it was just opened on a square foot [1,335 m].
The biggest one is in London.
Many events together, thanks to Valentino's proposals for taking the lead in the Competition Council, led us to finally overincreasing in the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's well-famous presidential table seemed even more amazing in front of the most famous Chagallov works.
The one who was heartbroken by the recent death of his brother had nothing to complain about, dressed in the clothes of this sign and the scars of the ELAH, over which he was silent, and bound to his son Luise - almost two-foot elegance - provided Valentine's table before his dinner for his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango's company, took a greeting and as the real gentleman stayed with Baroque Rothschild without a sac, because they both offered it to two ladies.
Monique Cruz, who came to the store in - hand-made - shirts and shirts, and at dinner she moved into long black hats, went through the night after the Goyi Toled's opera, showed us a room for ballet tests, and at other times she caught one of her shirts and marked "great swimming".
In√©s Sastreo didn't keep up on his visit to the next building, but he showed us pictures of his son on the mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to love the presence of Olivier Mart√≠nez - another young man who rides on the bike - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own drawings and gloves and firstly asked that no bells be used in his rooms.
The stars under the star of Paris.
Oh, it's life.
1001 - anti-pressure number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about a Chaotic and boring daily life.
And so it's not very small, they're all wrapped up in one book that comes to the bookstore on September 30th.
The building sounds every morning at 7:00 a.m. as punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself trapped in a successful rhythm that brings a modern life.
The office is called stress and computer pain behind.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there are neither one nor two methods of combating day - to - day abuse and the problems of turning away from the world of work.
No, it's not about anything bigger or less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott‚Äôs non-joggin position, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her books gathered all the "menu" options managed by the experience and the time options of each individual.
The anti-pressure book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and the possession of Pearson Alhambra and DK brings ease to the library.
If someone has the idea that it is impossible to find comfort in areas such as work or personal relationships, "handling" will support this view.
It also offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you already have an adrenaline in your veins, which causes balance in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on your throat, turn off and focus on reading.
Speaking in Spanish
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and tell us something that happened the other day, but the kids who're talking are sleeping.
When this happens first, it may heal you, but it's actually meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somnoloxicam.
It's quite common, especially for children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you has been told he was talking out of bed at night.
This fever can be very traumatic (e.g. once for life in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once for a week, once for a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There's only one reason why she's going to explain it.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night sweats, night sweats (night assistance) or nightmares, but it must not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can sometimes produce very high fevers, stressful or frustrated situations.
In any case, it's just a little bit of a test drive.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say a single word, a joke, or just the opposite (voice, cry, long words...).
In cases where a child is very strong, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with an expert to find out if there is no problem that causes him great embarrassment and this way.
We said it's a harmless disorder, so it's not treated unless it's added to another disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it's related to apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by recalling several very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So try to find quiet games and avoid either scary or some violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who can relax their work, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them find some inner rest.
It's a child's best sleep.
If so, try to stay calm.
Remember that it's harmless for a child and that the next day he won't remember anything.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
Don't be him.
It's too important because he's not in the knowledge and you're gonna break his sleep.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping, and then he's resting.
Remember, if you feel that you are suffering too much on several occasions, it would be appropriate to talk about advice or to find out what causes such irritation in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid trying to listen to him and ask him for information.
It won't work, because when she's asleep, she's not aware she can sort things out.
In addition, you listen to what he says, but you don't know what he thinks about, and so why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come up with.
Never tell your child you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even from toys.
That's what makes a lot of fun.
Don't worry about it. It's nothing wrong. It's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeussern...
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long lost period.
Before they could play a particularly large game, they created more chances and were able to make one of them win.
The game wasn't going to be during this attack, where the attackers were just trying to get through too fast.
After the first attempt by Captain Kauffmannna, who only shot from a distance about the train past the connection, Illhaeusern began to have ease of proposal and first of all Funderflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to pursue the defence of Dannemarie.
On the contrary, the opponent set up half a defense tower and left only an agile Rihai on the battlefield.
The beginning of the second half appeared as decisive, first thanks to the two Dannemarie chances named Rihai and Temporale, then after opening the course for Illhaeusern, which took care of Marais, well placed for the treatment of the sword reflected after the previous trial of Dibold (53').
However, the joy of G√∂lman Illhauser was not long gone, about 12 minutes later he was forced to return to the store and thus leave his fellow players to weaken.
However, Dannemarie was unable to pull out and eleven of Illhaeussern, who just happened to "invasion" the defense, no longer caused any greater difficulties, with the exception of the last seconds of the game, when the game flew very close to autumn.
Sarkozy's going to hit the abandoned fishermen.
Before leaving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is making a trip across Britain.
In order to address the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who strongly violated the availability of several British and Nordic ports on Monday, the French President decided to go out to Guilvinec in Finist√®re on Monday to meet their representatives.
The last appointed ones promised that they would accept "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "it will come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as a wave gathering of "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen with a view to achieving measures against the rapid increase in oil prices which have reached a peak of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the Elysian Palace of David Martina, the president "will be talking about solutions that can be presented in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure conditions of employment and pay for seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be a fisherman with disabilities.
In the morning, they carried out the "home" operation (a small operation of driving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in a 10 km cut.
The resort in Quiberon was also blocked, but it was not interrupted in the direction of Belle-√éle.
A filter room was provided on the Quebec Peninsula.
The seamen had already demonstrated their resolve on Monday when, right before the foundation of the monasteries in Brest and Lorento, they burned pneumatics and pallets while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc conducted demonstrations.
It was spread to other ports along the Atlantic and the Manche Canal, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vend√©e, where there were no trailers left in the port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the block during the evenings of the important total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait before they could decide on their own to attend a midterm meeting in the ministry.
In Guilvinec, however, the "crisis committee" has to decide on how to continue on the road ahead and on its participation in the preparatory meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the Heads of State Fisheries Committee representatives who did not support their pursuit.
"The move will continue" because "fishers from nothing" and "they don't want to get to Paris," reported Liliane Cariou, president of the board of fisheries in Lorento.
Fishermen who do not pay oil tax are currently about 50 cents per litre, however, it is considered that the cost of efficiency of the ship is achieved only if oil is below EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman grandpa
An unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or also Sam Mendes gave a lecture to the politically engaged priest Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its forecasts supply for 2008
Brazil's aircraft manufacturer depends on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, through the threat of recession that is on the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its forecasts of supply for 2008 with 215 additional equipment, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer is very promising from the Chinese market, especially on the scale of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To this day Embraer has added 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
The AIG considers that 15 % of its assets are taken into account
The American International Group, which the American money institutions have received over water, considers that more than 15% of their assets would be paid for $85 billion, which was given as a basis, writes a non-performing Financial Times issue.
The AIG is prepared to test the sale of most of its activities outside the international field of life insurance and pension activities in the United States, specifying the day that mentions the resources of the close-to-back operation.
According to FT, the AIG Governing Council met on Sunday during the evening to examine any action.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory declaration from the AIG.
The assets that AIG is willing to release include its Airless Leasing International Financial Corp., its 59% share in Transatlantic Holdings insurance policy as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, provide FT.
No final decision on these proceedings has yet been taken, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain ready to pay the loan of 85 billion which was granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk that the US authorities would have 80 % of its capital, which would at the same time be offset by the current shareholders' own shareholding.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the Snemovan representatives rejected Paulson's rescue plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an invisible loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Down Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was published on 777.68 points on 10, 365.45 points.
The largest peak in its history (about 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq Index with a transferable technology component was lost, according to the final data after the end of the trade, 199.61 points and was set at 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) at 1 106.55 points.
Since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has suddenly lost its seat after the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the Sneak Bank's representatives, a plan that should have made it possible to re-establish some stability in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 against the representatives refused to provide the secret state depositary with Henry Paulson's means he requested.
Two Republicans from three refused his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market that the Congress is unable to accept a certain plan," Lindsey Piegza from the FTN Financial is thought to be.
"It shows how much the market has relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days did not come "too late".
"If this project is really suited to the loan (...), the staff will be promptly transferred to Fedu (American Central Bank, par. rev.) and to other central banks in order to signal the crisis, which would further confirm the terms of the credit," warned Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight.
And based on the urgency of the Piegza situation, in the United States, "every new day brings the burden of one financial institution".
After the fifth quarter of Washington Mutual, the banks of the Bank of Wachov were organised by its Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has now taken on its way back and has demanded immediate intervention in the Bank's benefits in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, in Iceland and in Germany, which means that markets do not go "only with the US crisis, despite the world's crisis", added analytic from the FTN Financial.
The market with the bonds has gone strong.
The result of the 10-year index was 3,632 % of 3,827 % of turnover on Friday evening, 30 % of 4,161 % of turnover 4,357 % of last day.
Both won on points in the first TV double
After the first five-day debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, with the task of finding out who of both John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The majority states of the campaign of Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a television duele followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCaina's performance, whatever he was hearing, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before presidential elections, a fall in research.
The Gallup Constitution, which a public opinion study published on Saturday adds to Obama's five-year-old shock (49% against 44% for McCaina), argues that democracy is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters directly concerned is Obama‚Äôs 39% winner, while according to the CBS study, 25% join McCain‚Äôs victory.
Both should have the opportunity to confirm their conduct in the fourth quarter with the proposed good performance of their colleague Joseph Biden, during the first and most recent public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It's a gift," he warned, however, about the weekend Bill Clinton.
Seventeen McCain has consistently raised his unwarranted experience in the field of foreign policy, at the same time stressing his opponent's "navit" in matters that created the core of the first survey.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." said the repeated charges.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such an aggressive spirit, the Republican TV shows were not available since yesterday.
In contrast, both stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and showed up as an expert and precise.
He has given up his ability to make the right decision and to renew the good news of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," replied about the week's democratic debate, which the Republicans read that it does not take enough to bring about the impact of the crisis on "normal American".
"During the nine-minute debate John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama announced yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at a pre-conceived competition in North Carolina for the spring rain.
He did not even say the words "meaning class" or "working", but the financial balance makes Obama feel more capable of saving the economy at the end of the disaster.
"The next week you could come up with a decisive return," said powerful democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, likened Obama to "economic prosperity" to what Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For democratic candidates, it is a contemporary summit "the final currency of an eight-year-old bad economic policy, how George Bush conducted it and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce the tax by 95% of Americans, and also warned that the country's possible energy independence through the transfer of renewable energy sources is his priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build the park again with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided issues related to the financial assistance plan of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) which were adopted last night by Congress and which is very popular.
"What did you guys notice that some of the elections took place in Minsk?"
Young people and the rest of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the capital city of Belarus to reject the results of parliamentary elections.
Several hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after closing the voting facilities at the main hall in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of the vote in Parliament.
Although no results have yet been reported, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukaschenka's regime: "dictator, demos".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections, "What would it be when they do what they want with my voice," says one youth.
He does not believe that this regime which has been reserved to foreign observers with a view to renewing the European Union's agreement would be prepared to carry out the process of democracy.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 White Capsules and the freezing of certain assets, may be cancelled if the choices are considered clean.
It wasn't like that, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in counting the votes," said Juri Pot√©mkin, a spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, from the various groups of 12 sides.
"It's about cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievic, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leads the person of the pro-European movement, "because it's important who takes the vote, and we have the power to do so.
If any opposition Members get to Parliament, they will be appointed and will never be elected.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean space on television, meeting in regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore feel compelled to participate in political functioning because dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
It's all about our economy, our deep debt in Russia, the coming crisis, and we're not reforming, it's threatening us to become Russia's protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not declare the elections to be valid.
It highlights that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of a preliminary vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the way for all possible manipulation.
"What have you noticed that some elections have taken place?" is social-democratic leader Alexander Kosulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"In volunteer places there was no foot.
And there will be at least five opposition Members in Parliament, those who are the most outlawed of the regime."
The night's quiet has been back in the spring.
On television, President Luka≈°enko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome success.
Talk - Blood that's safe again
Hema-Qu√©bec celebrated the 10th anniversary of the establishment yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine D√©cary, was rightly pleased because Hema-Qu√©bec became one of the most reliable and most effective blood donors in the world.
In particular, he regained public confidence, which was severely damaged after scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the national blood reserve prepared by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee has been contaminated by the virus of immune deficiency (HIV) and type C hepatitis during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and with the will of the public, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation in February 1994, to which Judge Horace Krever, who was to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to formulate a recommendation that such a meeting be no longer repeated.
While Judge Krever continued with the rejection of the report, some provinces led to a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Qu√©bec, the G√©linea Committee took up this role.
After G√©lineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Qu√©bec, who was to manage Qu√©bec and the Canadian Blood Society for the administration of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Qu√©bec started his activities in 1998, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Decary says.
"The situation was shocking.
In a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area during the coming years, we have gained confidence in the public," Hema-Qu√©bek says and adds that by the beginning of 2008, there were already fewer than 94% of the Quebec population.
Dr. D√©cary's still missing from the audience that "trust is a very sinful thing."
Hema-Qu√©bec has already applied the principle of transparency since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
"In Europe we were witnesses to the outbreak of many cases of human abuse of crazy goods, new variants of what is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," reports a woman who has been led by the company since its establishment in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
We therefore objected to one of the basic recommendations of Kreverov and G√©lineau's report, in which case we do not know this and where there is a serious danger in spreading serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disability, which is marked by degenerational brains which are inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take an exceptional measure.
In June 1999, therefore, we refused blood from people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safe to believe that this disease was transfusing.
So this episode has shown us that keeping the principle of transparency meant something."
In 1999 a much more precise technique for detecting HIV was found on the market: tests using nucleoic acid (NAT), which allow for the direct presence of the virus itself, and never the presence of antibodies on which tests were previously used.
The NAT tests have been able to cut short periods that occur between the patient's prompting and the moment when our techniques may be in the blood of the first virus detected, explains the specialist.
We've been able to cut this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some gifts could be ordered without knowing and without being able to come to it.
This improvement has significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting HIV-contained blood is now exposed to one of the 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone is infected.
In view of this, Hema-Qu√©bec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product.
I have the impression that today we can simply get or prescribe blood transfusions as necessary for healing," says Head of Management Hema-Qu√©bek.
"The next decade's challenge is to maintain the safety of our products.
We don't know what kind of pathogen can be found in the system.
Just last year on the island of R√©union discovered a chikungunya virus that similar to the West Nile virus was transferred to the blood by boiling in the urine.
Hema-Qu√©bec has to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. D√©caryy and points out that in addition to safe practice, hema-Qu√©bec must also be counted with sufficient equipment.
"The needs are growing because the population is old.
As a result of increased aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which is averaged only 3% of Quebecans eligible for donations."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the criteria for admission, but can only donate blood once in 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of the people offering blood are not accepted in the average because they have been carrying AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where there are plenty of swine fever, they are excluded for a year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a situation that is consistent with the needs of the patient.
The shortcomings are very rare.
However, members of the donor network should be informed of how old and unable to donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially then to hold on and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unsatisfied today that we will only find an hour so we can donate blood," says Francine D√©cary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Qu√©bec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues such as bone transplants, heart disease, eye ulcers and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Qu√©bek, which also arranges one public blood bank from the pumping pipes in Quebec.
Peaches, previously considered as biomedicine waste, spills the blood of rich people on tribal cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated our thousands of blood samples from poplars into the bank and we assume we'll pick them up over a thousand years ago.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering transplantation," explains Dr. D√©cary, whose blood collection program describes as very popular.
"Some mothers are forced to have no access to it," because Hema-Qu√©bec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all patients in Quebec.
Fotbal - Impact on semi-finals
Yesterday, the impact Montr√©al was at the Saputo stadium during the second and equally decisive fourth-final game of food at the total number of defenses qualified to a semi-final car series of first division of the USL, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the total balance of both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Lieutenant Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive round in the 90th minute of the game.
After both the first half of the arm's length were visited by Founder David Testo and Rocco Plantentino, the remaining two tops of the visual formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could consult Matt Jordan in the interests of Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of the two fourths finals, the impact on the Starfire Complex in Tukwale on the site of Seattle defeat 2:1.
The impact will be measured in semi-finals with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder was equal to the domestic game of deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went to the semifinal car with the total number of defenses 5:4.
The impact should be seen with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however, details on the series of stocks will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev‚Äôs winning goal
The first three Canadian attacks are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tom√°≈°e Plekance and Andreje Kosticin last night in Central Bell launched an attack on the victory of Canada 3:2 on its own.
Kosticin, the largest star of lightning, shot his head, Plekanec gathered two assistments and Kovalev closed one game in this fourth win of six ready-to-be-funded game.
Kovalev won the victory by giving himself a single hole during his own voyages.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Rus.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third he tried to control it too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he evaluated the end of the game.
He had a nice pocket."
Charest points north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year.
At the end of the Liberal Party's session (the Liberal Party) Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where today's additional elections are the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Remove from our last large northern border" is such a long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented in a visual manner yesterday at the conclusion of the session of the Liberal Party of Qu√©bek in L√©vis, but did not provide details.
During his speech, behind him were the images mentioned in any painting.
On three large plates, the shirt ran with beautiful pictures of hydroelectric fences, down, Qu√©bek from the "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources, like in the pre-cold period.
At the recent press conference, the Prime Minister refused to state that he would call for a preliminary vote on the floor, even though he warned that he had a very busy programme.
The "Sever Plan" creates a fourth dimension of "visi", which the Prime Minister thinks of for Qu√©bec, a "new economic space" vision, which includes an agreement with France on labour force, a contract between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory at 49th level - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, there has never been a subject of presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North represents a "surface with huge potential", however, did not introduce terms, higher investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
The above mentioned several approaches to areas that could be further worked out: in particular water electricity, wood, in particular the low sector, driven by rapid growth in developing countries and public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's account, contains "nil, zinc, honey, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land will take twice as much as France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as he wanted to show that he's allowed a certain national depository.
Qu√©bec was built to a great extent in relation to the North, he won the prime minister: gold medal in Abitib, Quebec engineering, James's castle.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he literally disappeared to look at the vast map behind his back.
North, 70% of Quebec's territory, including the portion of Labrador, which Qu√©bec has always requested, has outlined the prime minister during the press conference.
"It's a traditional position which repeated all the customs authorities.
There is a border mark which is no longer the contract for a long time and if an appropriate opportunity arises, on behalf of the government, it will be re-encouraged," he said.
On the other hand, "it is also necessary to rethink our view of the North," he said when he spoke about the transition to the North-West, which, as a result of the silence of the icebreakers, opens up completely.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister is of the opinion that it is a duty to take up the territory.
And what of the inhabitants of the land, the peoples and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful and that the project would be successful, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourneau (the former Pequistic Ambassador from Hungary), who have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Beno√Æt Pelletier, has an important position by Julie Boulett (Development and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "no need to summit", but the moment when "a joint vision will be taken out".
North development should last in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Sever plan will be "commonly designed, structured and dedicated to the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visi" as a swimming pool on the scene of liberal primers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who have gone before us, we have changed our minds to change challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
The latter was one of the still controversial topics of the weekend which was launched on Friday by a great cocktail of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's move to the top of the page.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to turn Beauharno's centre into Ad√©lard-Godbott's castle.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Qu√©bec, through Lesage, who carried out the Cold Revolution and the birth of water power, until after Bourassus, who created James's arrest, our party was able to create the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he called on another authority, this time conservative, and he called on the "Roads to the North" program, John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a series of Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectrics came up, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I'm going to be there," he believed on the basis of what he called a major strike.
The same prime minister who said in depth that in 2008 there would be no elections, and no doubt even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of voting under this year's law.
However, he stressed that his programme is underway, particularly the mission of the Federal Councils in China and the Qu√©bec-New York summit.
The Weekend session provided the leaders of the Liberals platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "can change the constitution", which have been very cold: PLQ (Liberal Side Qu√©bek) requires in particular the recognition of "Qu√©beku specificities" in the Constitution.
Qu√©bec is also intended to appoint a member of the Canadian Council for Voice and Television which would have the right to vote in the event of a decision taken in Quebec.
By the opposition, the Sever Plan was adopted by skeptics in its main features.
The Head of PQ (Parti Qu√©becois) Pauline Marois again highlighted North Qu√©bek Development Policy, which was launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to it, when the Liberal Government came into force in 2003, the completion of this policy was delayed.
If she'd stick with her, "we'd be going on today," Marois would have known her candidates for Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) by Fran√ßoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But let's accept that this is not just a theatre," explained S√©bastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letters - Destroyed country
It was Vic Toews, Minister of Justice (on irony) at Harper's office, who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last year that he represented Canada as "hanbu".
That's how to bury a woman who has led an inexhaustible fight for justice and who deserves all our vengeance, it tells many about the prime minister's environment and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government which as the only one of all the Western countries involved has not returned to the power of its State official closed in the Guant√°namo concentration camp.
The government that doesn't even know that at the time they were supposed to play the acts that were taken away from him, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, although having signed a Women's Convention, Canada signs its word and lets it go under the Dutch conditions of the child soldier.
The only one who depends on the family of justice to judge the guilty one's fault.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and in particular the Canadian Law Associations are rejecting Omar Khadra's repatriation so that he can wait for a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes before suffering: it little depends on the fact that this young man has been mentally destroyed, and it has undoubtedly continued after so many years of persecution.
We don't know that, but we're just witnesses of the imminent erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democratic" words that Harper's so angry with and from his mouth seems so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to arrest him according to the wish of the chief of minority governments (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that announces the dignity, law and order: they do not see that this government has achieved what has created our country's reputation and importance.
Hanba is, Mr. Toews, in this case, and not elsewhere.
Nazary - Orwelovsk√Ω discourses company Barrick Gold
In its 17th September issue, Le Debor published Patrick J. Garvera, executive vice president of the Canadian subsidiary Barrick Gold.
With Orwelovic logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun to bring together three authors and a poor little burden on respect for dignity with a view to calling for a "transparent public debate" and requiring six million of them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, there is no justice, especially in the case of a violation of respect, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver's fundamental solution is completely out of line.
Or is it perhaps for Barrick Gold the best way to bring public debate to the level of anyone who would dare to take the wrong position?
Regardless of the process, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend their valuables to be prepared to fight and fight in a very uneven fight against the army of lawyers supported by almost innocent prisoners of low-ranking society.
The tactics in these uneven wars are often started in the destruction of those who have been sued for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful procedure that will shut the door against the enemy and will also scare anyone who would dare to commit this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had her views on the whole thing to present a public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold is used, Canada is beginning to debate normal circumstances in exchange for ideas, and never in early autumn.
It is therefore not enough to open up their books, documentation and hold a genuine debate through news, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the whole matter.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and has rejected petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he could require "public debate", and at the same time reject public views?
It seems that this word in the Vice-Presidential World is merely a topically popular lawyer, not all Canadians; it is quite enamored of the idea.
In democracy they have the right to speak and actigate.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or he doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so in particular because it refuses the brutal ways of the lower society.
The public is ready to listen and agree, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, there is no way in which many feel that they are to be heard by the appellant's mouth (in its "public debate" company, Barrick immediately called on the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
If we remember the surreal Garver's demonstration, reaching started by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of worship and the pursuit of truth that are fundamental to every democratic society.
It fully supports the right to quote reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the basis for intellectual activity itself.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without showing up to repeated encounters, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was guided by the scientific standards used by the author of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has been able to conduct debates and disputes and resolve conflicts a long time ago.
The above-mentioned application by Barrick Gold clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
For the university world it is loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such an unfair approach.
Wall Street rescue operations - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administrative and translation of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saved economic plan since the great crisis in the third year.
A new version of the plan, such as by helping 700 billion dollars to bridge the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it proposes: better control of the selected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure payment of public funds, new measures to capture the amount of households for non-payment and also the right to monitor the increase in the number of employees paid by the company.
The US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, the shadow representative of Nancy Pelos√≠ and the representative of the Republicans at the board of directors, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-way negotiations.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said Bush's representative, Henry Paulson.
"It was all done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans would be safe from the crisis just running on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is an essential point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and the daily lives of Americans will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the past few hours, the merger has turned to maximum returns from fear of effect which would have to be further reduced to the availability of investors.
The time limit set was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates at the US President were invited to join later, and they expressed themselves further to the agreement, but they mentioned their concern that they had to avoid such a national solution.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on some measures, in particular those aimed at enabling residents to stay in their homes and the measures taken by the leading companies.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to be grateful for.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough lines I've read show that it's something we're all going to have to spend and it's going to be possible to move on.
Allowing inaction is shortly unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion plan is to buy for the money of taxpayers suspicious searches and risk and non-sale assets of US financial institutions.
The plan comes after the 14-month crisis, which was triggered by the booming bubbles on the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes), then moved to another broader forms of credit (PCAA) and released in the freezing of cash and bank and financial institutions.
The first proposal for an agreement from last week shall be communicated by the Republican Ambassador.
Since the time the Democrats have come to the conclusion that for some "toxic" assets of companies with problems, the government will just hand them over, but it will not buy them, it is convinced that the situation in the east is blessed.
In an attempt to draw closer to the negative views of the Congress, measures designed to allow the government to impose new payments that would help it to regain its balance would have to be reimbursed for five years.
The new plan shall be calculated by the initial amount of 250 billion which will be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
Another 350 billion dollars should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help Washington will receive shares in the saved companies that will pay dividends in the event of profit and who will be able to sell again when it is after all.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the procedure for the entertainment of property related to loans, as well as to set limits for the higher assessment and the damage paid to the company's lead workers.
The experts of the plan would like to make a vote in the Senate representatives today and in the middle of the Senate.
Despite all the efforts, it is still uncertain whether their plan will have green.
Yesterday, however, votes against this project were raised in both the Republican and the Democratic Party.
"It is quite obvious that Washington doesn't listen to you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of Snow.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there's a solution.
But it's not the solution to make payments."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, director of a group of congressmen who is surprised by the "sceptic selection", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four considered economic teachers, including three Nobel Prize holders, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was again confirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting three Benelux countries announced the partial birth of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitors, which has been on the ground since it lost 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) due to the crisis of the risk credit for the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies.
"We won't come here about this money," said the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"On payment we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And it's just the hunters and households that can't assess today's time."
On the other hand, the La Manche canal already seems to have begun the British government‚Äôs birth of another bank in the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to transfer all existing loans to Bradford and Bringley bank, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) were created for the purchase of property.
According to its previous notice, she buys out the shares and accounts of the customers of the British Bank of Spain Bank of Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to generate from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with the blue eyes long represented his turf, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American heretic come out with a funny smile about Narcissism?
Yes and no.
Mildness, compassion, and unselfish talent, which were his own, also drew him out of a violent category that produces real stars.
But what a long time it was to run!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 years of age on his morning at Connecticut because of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of American filming years.
Less than Brando, who was like and for a long time was his rival on film pay, Newman was a more careful hero, certainly a Greek, but also an apostle of freedom and the collapse of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the famous forms of American dream was born.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Because in it all this country was in love with itself made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in the battle that started in the early 50s of Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theatre, in television and in movies.
The same man who fought for civil law was also a car driver who took place as the second for the 24-hour Le Mans in 1979 and also a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he has created a model couple with Herpe Joanne Woodward.
It also removes the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to their own show-business, which will always remain to a certain extent.
An obedient man, in the highest sense of speech.
From Paul Newman's departure this week, she made it possible for lovers to return to the film, while his great role together is opposed to the black memorial.
After him, more than half a century has gone by the changing American seventh art.
In memory, they are re-encouraged by the Charming Covet from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Coƒçce on a burned roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From less than a century ago (1990), we are benefiting from his compassionate Mr. Bridge, who has been surrounded by a marriage that has failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans got into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a hardened, violent, unforgettable delegate from Someone Up There Likes Me (In the sense of hate) Robert Wise, a role assigned to James Deana, taken after his death, which Newman introduced in 1956.
Sympathetic Gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The Hustler Robert Rossena (1961) is an exciting and exciting Christmas player, and I will also be the creator of The Color of Money Martin Scoresey, which will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This guy's been traveling years, it was him.
And he's back.
In his professional path, he's faced with different kinds of times.
Young people are especially familiar with the cultural Slap Shot George Roy Hilla (1977) from Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey trainer.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of Coenov's brothers.
He then closed his career in the role of an Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sama Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends that were relatively soon abandoned, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, perhaps dissociating Hollywood from his payouts, performances and performances.
French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, never considered her "to be a living challenge of under-playing", considers that in her performances he had too much pressure on the pill.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose role as a high priest, the profession was not always so gentle.
The first lovers, however, played less frequently than outdoors: neurotics, alcohols, lungs and zophalices, their fall and excitement reflected in his perfect features.
As director Newman removed a few well-known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played its main role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, who lost because of his transmission, was filming Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of study and grief.
In a song that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former counterpart Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and at Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) warmly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Greatness, love for life, these are the main properties of the dead witch.
If we remember his legendary career, there's also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, the defeat of Hollywood.
We used to see his likeness on the bottles of wine octopus, cucumbers, soybeans and other foods, which might seem quite non-sustainable to us, although initially it was about gay.
However, the profits from the sale went to his childhood tax account.
Newman's been doing so, more than he's allowed to become famous. He's been working in the company for the last time.
He left a letter containing these verses to his five daughters: "Always and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I felt like I could've been here."
And for us, it was a privilege to follow the life course of such a clear and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the world, the model town.
What was produced in the factory on the factors Zuschlag & sex.?
Suddenly, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against J√°nos Zuschlag and his associates began.
Policy and its partners are in addition to other criminal acts, including the distribution of letters, accused of substantiated long-term and systematic criminal organisations, resulting in extremely significant damages.
According to the prosecutors, the money received in public competitions for their own purposes and the performance of their tasks has often been demonstrated by positive factors.
Money from the state and self-government - about 65 million forints - traveled to Fiatal Balldal's warehouse, part to the individual's captain.
The manner in which the investigating authority also informed him was based on the fact that the money received in public competition was chosen on the basis of an invoice for which there was no real advantage and that the obligations accepted by the company were never met.
According to the complaint, a large part of the invoice was false.
Prints of these invoices came from the J√≥zsefvarsk market, which was made in Kiskunhalasi.
On the name of the company to which the production of the invoice is to be carried out, it was decided, inter alia, on a circular road along the northern coast of Balaton, on which Istv√°n Lados J√°nos Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he had a first-named look at pensions and restaurants.
He asked for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices were then produced under public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, of the capital city.
The facts were presented by most of Istv√°n Lados with his partner Andras √ìrim, who, according to our information, wrote the most frequently reports needed to obtain the grant.
On his "Study Road" Lados looked at one of the poets.
According to two factors published by the Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, this hospitality facility was provided for the nine-year group from Biztos Pont.
So many people would not have come to this facility at once, according to the company‚Äôs claim.
Similarly, it was mistaken for the formal and content errors of the invoice presented in 2002 by the name of Jobb J√∂≈ër, later Egypt and the Harmadik √Åv√©red.
In Badacsonytotoja, the pension had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, although the invoices included one hundred thirty guests.
Full-time printers with a rich fantasy have also been able to overcome this when they brought to the evidence of the company‚Äôs so-called hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., whose account according to the information provided to the state representative of documents changing the name of Jobb J√∂√∂≈ëret and Hoppa did not represent.
The management of G√ºh≈ë Farkas for vvg.hu indicated that when they called him to the prosecution and showed him invoices, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formality, he did not even agree that according to the fact that hundreds of people lived there, there are only a dozen rooms that do not have such a great capacity.
In addition, there was also a fear of the fact that their restaurants are no longer functioning for a long time.
The proud invoice producers did not even believe that the well-known Budapest Travel Office only organises foreign routes and, on the basis of the fact that it was not in line with the invoice practice of the companies, they were introduced as a travel service through Hungary.
In addition to the fact that DPH was also included in the document during the investigation, it is necessary that the organisation of the journey to the country outside the European Union was exempted from DPH.
In the four documents presented by Jobb J√∂≈ëret, the company Hotel R√©vf√ºll√∂p s. r. o. did not agree with any other DPH. However, the company did not apply the mentioned 25%, although about 15% of DPH, except for the hotel staff showed only the printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the fact that the "suppliers" had been affected by the fact that one company had been informed of the fact that the investigation of State representation had led to a public transport activity which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on investment advice.
The fact that the invoices are issued by Egypt and the Harmadic √Åvezred√©rt and by the XXI. In addition to the fact that cultural union and Bistos Pont are false, they have also failed because of the formal differences - the inappropriate format of the invoice and the incorrect analysis.
As in the case of Ravenna K. S. or the Sports Camp in Kunfeh√©rt√≥, whose representatives claimed that they would issue invoices.
For example, the shareholders did not even notice that HIB S. v. of Nyirreghihazy was at the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal V√°rosert, in liquidation, claimed that the company's liquidity commission also issued paper.
Facts were presented with scientific knowledge
The other group of factoring people who knew they were supposed to show a positive factor.
Nadace Es√©ly Budapest has issued accounts for a total of four million Forints for the Armadik √âvezred√©rt at the request of the Fiatal Ballodal - Ifj√º Socialistak.
Collab S. r. o. received a complaint from one of the accused Ludovic Gy√∂rfi's chief account.
Zuschlagem and its partners also collaborated with Biogate S. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 carried out Jobb J√∂√∂≈ëret and Atlasz and V√∂r√∂sfenyhe invoices in the value of five million forts for which there was no actual economic activity.
Don't move the money because the invoices created were stolen later, which the organizations have forgotten to include in their documents.
The other group of invoice companies are those who were linked to the complainants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was a trusted representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Tri√≥ s.r.o., which lives in the trade with fine motor vehicles and motor vehicles, located in Budapest, where the company is not available.
In October, November and December 2005, the company presented a number of invoices for the sale of the means of calculating the value of approximately 18 million dollars.
According to the investigation, the company Cash Investment purchased these invoices from 14 September 2005 in liquidation.
The manager of the company was a man from Romania who had to submit letters to the company in 2002-2005 as well as to Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the companies Atlas, Hoppa and the tasks of Egypt and Harmadik √âvezredert and himself accepted them.
In response to Ivan Kubatov's request, the Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
Actually, none of the company worked, according to the complainant, because they didn't have a job.
However, he was successful because, at the request of the Associated Lawyer, Zsolta Sainte, who also prepared their depositary letters, he presented a company of invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generacy related to Zuschlag.
In the name of the company Investment, Delta Tri√≥, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million dollars.
State representation has shown that Kubatov has come to 10 per cent of the figures and DPH.
In order to demonstrate the strength of the invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the company Bistos Pont, the husband also used Szi-Beri, etc.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and Association and Modern Hungary submitted proposals for Nadace Mihalye T√°ncsicse (TMA), a public welfare organisation of the socialist party.
It was obtained by 500 thousand forintets, but the amounts were not invested for the purpose set out in the tenders.
To prevent this from happening again, TMA submitted five positive factors from the Workings Team s. r. o.
These invoices were recently found during a domestic visit to the office of √Årp√°d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the complainants will probably describe the process of producing the invoice as she has already done for the prosecutor.
It can be interesting if you decide to find out all the main complainant, J√°nos Zuschlag.
His summary statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will do it in general, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - instead of paying a large amount of damage, 50 million forints, perhaps socialists have concluded an agreement with him and Zusi will take it on himself.
Finally, he could have expressed himself because his request for reconciliation of the conditions of his detention, although he was put in prison, remained unheard of.
While the security forces of economic criminal acts that have caused much more damage that have not yet been compensated, they can freely pass or at least wait for the end of their proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of drumming: Why do we spend more money?
The customers are willing to spend more money on the prizes, value the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and apparently irrational - behavior enabled researchers from the neurology and the New York University economy to discover.
According to their studies published in Science magazine, people do not want to stay in competition with eBay auction type, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research has tried to map this "game" scheme into the nervous system.
One group of volunteers, the other group participated in food auctions, using the methods of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) tested the active areas of the brain of test subjects.
In both games, participants were able to win money, especially at the auction game, whose important element is to cross over the other side, he began to operate intensively when he lost his mind under a brain tumor called the strike.
This brain area plays an additional role in the "self-modifying" mechanism of the nervous system.
It is therefore possible for researchers to explain their efforts to avoid sudden street reactions.
To support their theory, members of the research team conducted a number of financial cross-checks.
Three groups were against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply notified which is the actual value of the product concerned and they made checks.
Other groups were also promised that if they won the game, they would receive another $15.
On the other hand, the third group received $15 in advance of the prize, and in the event of losses its members also received the money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups began all over the fact that one was focused on winning and the other.
The members of the "opposite" group were still willing to go higher than was in the control and "win" group, which confirms neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
Those who have so far explained the ills observed at the auctions of victory and risk avoidance.
When neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the differences between these two theories so that we have now reached a third explanation," noted Andrew Schotter, professor of economic colleges of New York University.
Hepatitis: When to look for a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer chronic hepatitis B or C infection, then in Hungary, this chronic liver disease has been reported among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name hepatitis is a combination of the name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, marked by liver and liver problems, all the causes of fatigue and the disease caused by them differs from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread by two main methods: hepatitis A and E trajectory (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluids (sem, secretion, urine).
Travellers should be protected by anti-virus A and B, which does not exist against type C virus.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after the administration of infected food, usually with nausea, nausea, chest problems, vomiting.
Then the skin and eye whites are created by a yellowish, bright chair and dry power. The treatment can last for two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people worldwide die of the most serious type of disease, liver cancer and liver surgery caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only every 10 prescribed medication is administered.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver surgery or liver cancer.
Most of those charged with their disability are not aware of it, the source of none of the liver cells is sickly, and the first signs will be delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important for temporary prevention, regular depravity.
In three groups this disease is much more common than in the average: between people who had blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
At the present time, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease can show a routine laboratory examination already, a person should contact his or her practical doctor if any of the causes of unknown causes are noted.
At the time of detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing the need and preventing cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized by the World Health Organization in 2004.
His aim is to warn of chronic liver failure caused by these viruses, due to its origin and the importance of temporary detection of disability.
Who believes in God, does that hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesics that could facilitate the death of already Catholic torturers.
Scientists from Oxford University have performed an interesting experiment, researching how belief in God affects one‚Äôs view of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
Within the framework of a fairly extraordinary study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electrical shocks, while all were observing the painting that depicts Mrs. Marie.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large portion of the pain.
The techniques of human brain testing have also shown that Catholics have been able to activate this part of their brain, which is responsible for disease control.
Research is the first of a series of research that is based on academia involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely so that the right hand of the test entity was fitted with an electric shock trigger.
The researchers asked the participants to make an effort to observe at least two paintings: the Sassoferat of Ms. Marii from the 17th century and the Queen of Leonard da Vinci, who was born in the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the view of Mrs. Marie would lead to a certain state of affairs for believers, while the image of Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the first, and it acted according to their comforting opinion.
Experimental entities spent half an hour in MRI scanners and during this period they received in the following four parts of 20 electroshocks, while separately monitoring the image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics reported that when they looked at Mrs. Marie, they felt "safe" as if they were "old" and "caught up, filled with peace."
As they looked at the picture with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than they had seen Leonard's work before.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, is believed to have the same effect that can be achieved with any powerful image and with atheists, only the right photograph should be found.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of the mother or father," said psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a matter of what effect it would have on the control of the pain of believers if they had shown them some madonada from Leonard or similar caliber.
Would it mean looking at Mrs. Marie's quality to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
Google can declare his ten birthdays that people can find him in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their head; he knows where they were allowed to go, what professional research is going on and what is interesting.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, it's still not enough.
With regard to skeptics, the facts of the parallel with the Orwell's dark vision, it is not quite clear the very foundation of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated for the Financial Times that the main goal of Googlu is to gather more personal data for users, which is necessary to enable Googlu developers to keep their original purpose, which he said: "Let's arrange all information in the world!"
According to the said representative of Googlu, the company has been working worldwide for ten years just in order to be able to work with all the information.
On a question that will be five years ago, Schmidt replied that if Google could answer questions like "what I have to do tomorrow?" or "what job would it really work for me?" - such simple questions are likely to not be able to answer any questions until they know about users enough information.
Not all Internet users know well that during the Internet search, exact words are quoted and what IP addresses have been searched and which pages have been moved by the interested parties after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service started two years ago, users can save their surfing history, for example, see what they were looking for and what clicks on, which then generates adapted products in a long-term perspective more directly to them - in the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, which will provide us with a system based on the above-mentioned and preserved preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone sees what I'm doing? - the users who have a look at the data monopoly Googlu fear.
In most cases, there is a threat of increasing the potential power represented by the company, the anti-reaction does not raise awareness among Internet users of guilt, fear of harassment, anxiety for freedom or even opposition to power.
However, it is confirmed that not only are all the expressions sought are caught, but in the case of justified cases, third parties may also be issued, in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
The most recent example was the coordination of actions against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Community pages of Orkut decided by its means.
Internet users who are afraid of personal rights, however, were still able to breathe in May when the EFF arm company successfully proved its truth in dispute with the FBI: Google must not be in any future article forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully eliminated almost fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which have received a call for enforcement prior to the year of the adoption of the Children's Protection Act, although it has not been able to obtain a list of individual users' search posts, the full list of websites and keywords for a period of two months.)
Google's view is so controversial: it's obsessed with those who fear to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be their starting to use Googlu services, exposed to interest, and exposed to it with a revolution that belongs to an international company with conservative images.
And while the American geek of culture and its strange attitude, which consists around itself of supercomputed computer fans, activists and users, which appear in many countries, it sees a new generation of vetofire, "corporations that are now frescoes", in contrast to its Microsoft River, considered by Windows as the recipient of the world, whatever they fight for the same purpose.
This may be caused by Google does not require from its users an identification code and does not want money for its application; open, free and continuous clean source of information and software packages are much more available, younger, "coolier" than is the practice of official software.
However, this can also be caused by the fact that geeks understand very clearly the very problem relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought them to just one of the most isolated key words in recent years: web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is not about anything but cooperation, that we leave ourselves mentally behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their scope is in each other, the foundation remains the same: we show.
An average young person can immediately upload a profile on several community sites from Facebook via Xangu, which can be easily shared with other services such as Twitter or last.fm applications that record his listening music, then all of which can be connected to navigation systems such as FriendsFed or Blip.fm, except for blogs where they will automatically display his latest photo gallery, which is on Flickr or Picase.
We can also learn about a lot of examples of these: a friend in the morning when looking at pictures of fellow friends it's easy to see what her bad friend was doing tonight, or a company can just throw out its employee because on its blog he is raising his honest opinion about top leadership: one is sure, the concept of private life has been completely overestimated today.
One who lives online lives depends on what he shows himself, so we can define the basics of this hideous behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to shut up or at least avoid the Googlos monopolies has the option (the Scrooglem, which uses Googlu's search system, does not seriously leave any steps).
A small number of people, for example, are not registered voluntarily on community sites so they can not be found. Googlu's online application from the text editor by photo editor and reporting portal is possible to exchange for an alternative version that is not connected to both server parks and which does not set up the best possible profile for us.
The public opinion is not too secret to be expected when Google shows a smile.
The subnet has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense entertainment sites are threatening the investment of advertising agencies and services carried out at an ever-fast pace are seriously disturbing not only Microsoft but also a number of other software designers.
However, critical observers also find contradictions that lead to misleading conclusions: for example, higher management rejected employees' protests after a double school fee, voluntaryly frequent day-care of employees was too costly according to the company's management, all of which is loss due to the fact that Google was still away from the Chinese government in 2006 and in the light of their agreements, it filters out every finding that results in a good experience, in line with the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company‚Äôs internal rules says that it never presupposes new services, even when it can already be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be tackled by the world in new places: while some believe that the Googlu project focuses on scanning and archiving books and magazines such as that the company will soon have something to do with the U.S. Supreme Court, another fears of its health system, and we can therefore set up a complete own health profile with previous issues, medical problems.
The fact that Google is a genetic database, then it can serve as a good source of material and for the next generation of ski-fi writers, the famous news of Cory Doctor "Scroogled" describes the future of the Orwelov reminiscentness in which it can be very close to man only with Googlu's data.
Two young people helped a double killer from Ozdu
Two young people were heard by the police in the case of a double murder in Ozda, which, according to a reasonable suspicion, helped to eliminate the crime, said in the speech of the Supreme Police Directorate of the Borsod.
Persons who have been suspected of being involved have found out and are currently accused of assisting in criminal proceedings.
Both young people, according to information from two MTI girls, have been set free.
Aid to criminal proceedings shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
The suspect of a double murder in Ozdu, a 23-year-old man, was taken to a temporary relationship on Sunday.
It is suspected of a criminal act planned for several counts of murder for serious reasons.
During the investigation, it was discovered that a 23 - year - old man had been responsible for a 53 - year - old man‚Äôs debt.
The suspect did not want to pay for his debt, so he drove his fellow believer through the middle of a single drive in Ozda, where he first killed his brother and then his nine - year - old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, a young man was preparing to commit a crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he was shooting a weapon hidden in the scene of a crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are the involvement of police experts.
The Warsaw Bursa made an offer to buy a Prague Burs
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered Warsaw stock exchanges for the purchase of a percentage package for the share of Prague stock exchanges.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, although the Czech Warsaw Exchange from the area of potential new owners of the Prague Exchange has already been excluded.
The reason is the fact that the Warsaw borough owns the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which sells more than 60 per cent of the securities in several months.
As the Czech economic day E15 says, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that was already offered by interested parties in the Prague stock market.
According to Czech lists, there were still offers of visual exchanges of valuable papers, transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London exchange and Deutsche B√∂rse.
The Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, Peter Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the newest new owner of all stakeholders and did not surprise that this could lead to the loss of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of Prague securities exchanges is estimated by experts on the stock market at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 per cent of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with around 25%, followed by the Czech comparator with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. i.e. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European Charters
In its comments on the day-to-day devoted to deepening the international financial crisis, the previous European lists remind us of "second 11 September".
We can thank the President of the United States for the global financial disaster, the Roman Republic. The President was not even able to reach his own side in support of the urgent proposal of the law, which aims to set this reliable situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk later about September 11th.
Also, part of the Madrid press is seen by the prosecutor in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, the world economy has contributed to the deterioration of the political leadership.
The risk of breaking up the U.S. financial system continues to grow, and eventually it will pay the whole world.
Bush's network plan was not perfect, but after the Congress's vote, it is dangerous that Washington does not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy depends on the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can't be forgotten anymore, the female daily Tages-Anzeiger shows.
Single States can still purchase saved bread from money institutions and taxpayers can save it from crack.
If it becomes like the bones of the domain, other banks will no longer have enough money or other improvisation.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union need to transfer their national egoism and combine control over the detailed financial markets.
Only on Monday did the existing monetary institutions get more than 100 billion euros, recalls the visional Der Standard, according to which they are concerned that, like the Americans, they will have to get deeper into their pockets and European taxpayers, more and more real.
The European Union is faced with a crisis which, as a result, falls on the old continent until it is still seriously absent.
"Savers" should not immediately have the stamps of the euro, but it would be good if they were to make sure that it is reasonable to think of taxpayers' money in order to make it even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates snowflake
What would be the best way to develop the technology of capable fighters if the imitation of detectors were not the obstacle posed in the world of nature?
For example, at school.
The emerging strategic idea of the surprising project presented at the Japanese CEATEC factory has been involving engineers from Nissan Chamber of Commerce. It has been about how to set up a new generation of anti-fraud systems.
In cooperation with such a university, Nissan built a biomimetic robotic system of type BR23C, a robotized mini-automatic, which has been developed by its properties, with the ultimate objective of helping to create a system that can eliminate all injuries.
"During the course of the year, each train will create its own personal space of an oval form, which is actually very similar to our safety coast," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology and Research and Development.
Important roles are played by complex eyes, including allowing them to see into all directions in a serious role of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers were able to copy the laser beam.
This shall identify obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C at 180 degrees in the solid field and shall calculate their distance and send a popup micro-processor signal which shall immediately change into an operation aimed at preventing the attack.
The stop is caught during the second break, then the robotised car begins to model the movement of the wheels and the circle as far as possible necessary to prevent the enemy immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this escape manoeuvre is simply carried out in an instinctive way.
"If it hadn't been so, a robotic car would not have been able to react too quickly to prevent it," explains Toshijuki Ando, the leading mobility laboratory and the project of a robotic car.
It must respond in an intensive and immediate manner, as this technology reflects the most vulnerable and most internal type of safety protection zone within which the dispute is currently considered as inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what she has learned to avoid another involvement.
This process must not take longer than the eye is dark.
In any case, this movement cannot be directed up, down or down, only by two-dimensional direction and only in a direction which can be circled around.
Instead of the endless opportunities offered, including in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of return movement, acceleration and slowdown was used.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are light and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-iont variants.
According to Andoa, there is an important incentive, intelligent response, no ability to process, thus less data storage.
This mechanism must only work and respond to a few incoming signals after the second.
It is not necessary to store and react to them using intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so it is still only used to remember the size of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need to remember the giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate escape which, according to Nissan's estimate, could be achieved in serious vehicles over a period of 10 years.
Another possibility of application may be to connect the unit to a satellite GPS navigation system that would lead the engine to the intended end-point.
Damn dear child has a name.
The Law on the Packaging for Saving the Economy at $700 billion, which is to be divided into several payments and whose purpose is to buy out quality bank loans, already has a written look.
In the first round half of the amount will be used.
After further meetings, which ended until Saturday after the half-day of the American East Time, representatives of Congress reached an agreement within a few days of the ongoing debate on a savings package in the total amount of $700 billion, the Reuters agency sent.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelos√≠, democratic president of the shadow representatives, according to which only the signing of the agreement is already in progress.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson announced the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 a.m. of Washington time (then on Monday at 2 a.m. of Central European time), although no special access was made to the burs.
On the proposal for a legislative norm on behalf of the Law on Economic Stabilisation for 2008 to be set up the programme will be voted on Monday, first by the Representatives of the Treaty and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosie on Saturday evening, after which reports of the agreement were also sent to the White House.
"With the progress made at night, we are calm and very grateful for the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said the speaker of the White House, Tony Fratto.
Finally, the programme is different from the Bush administration's original proposal, which should cover the purchase of non-quality securities secured by mortgages totalling $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose at least half the amount of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after what is expected in the morning of the Congress decision, and the finance ministry will buy them valuable securities secured by mortgages valued as quality, the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special assembly, which will also be chaired by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic in the meaning of the law: it can at the same time buy out non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "reciprocal" loans.
The redemption can take place within the auction and directly, by the competent representatives of the ministry.
The rule of law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance provides them with a guarantee of means of concern, which will then pay the company the price corresponding to the expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system to be spent at up to $700 billion, whether it is already about the large purchase of funds, their insurance or the prevention of the systemic risk associated with some of the major money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to adopt the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The chief banks that have come into trouble and are waiting for State aid, however, can be calculated by lowering the government‚Äôs discount - which is simply called a "goldfall".
To limit their payments only in certain cases, this restriction will also depend on the way the ministry is provided.
The restriction in principle means that if the ministry is to buy in the auction, there will be a tax deficit on gold fallings if the bank‚Äôs directors will not be sent to pay the same amount.
In the case of direct repurchase of non-quality loans, the government aggressively seeks to ensure that the management money is not transferred.
It is necessary to add that the existing gold-fall contracts are no longer amended, that only new contracts are concerned, which should be further encouraged to participate in the programme.
"It is the first case in American history when there is a legal restriction on the remuneration of general directors," said the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the Snowy Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the participating banks shall have the right to receive a share that reduces the risk of taxpayers, because when the economy and the savings bank stand on their feet, they can also do so.
The draft plan includes that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress for the next five years to recover the expected losses from the financial sector to the taxpayers.
On both sides, of course, there were also voices expressing in connection with the dispute plan.
"This is what American citizens have not asked us to do, this is all the dollars of tax taxpayers to avoid," a Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa said.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Captur's court, found that those who were responsible for breaking up Wall Street were called upon to take action.
Industrial prices continue to grow
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in July 2008 compared to August 2007 by 12.9 per cent by the Central Statistical Office.
Export sales prices in the industry were higher than 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent annually.
Production prices in the industry were as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to last month‚Äôs above 0.7 per cent, at an average rate of 3.2 per cent.

The domestic sales prices in the processing industry also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared with the July.
The largest price increase took place in July 2008 in the leather and clothing industry sector (2.8 per cent), in particular due to the monthly increase in prices in the beef and veal products industry by 4.6 per cent, respectively by 2.5 per cent.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the production sector of chemical materials and products (1.6 per cent).
Price reductions were achieved in the mining sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the timber sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices for paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, we planned to increase prices by 0.2 to 0.9 per cent.
In the production and development sector of electricity, gas and water, which has a high weight in the mining industry, increased by 0.3 per cent in August, particularly with the continued impact of the officially determined increase in the price of electricity from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic waste in individual processing industries, prices increased mainly in the professional processing sector (32.4 per cent).
In the beef and veal sector, it was possible to observe 13,2 %, in the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco products which have a decisive weight and then an 11 % increase in prices.

From the point of view of the division by weight of the division, the highest monthly increase in prices (0.7 per cent) in the remaining sectors of the production of weighted assets was demonstrated in July in the domestic sales.
Prices rose by 0.3 per cent in the manufacturing sectors, in the energy of the processing and further processing sectors, due to the previous month's prices remained unchanged.
The largest increase in prices due to the same month last year was possible in July 2008 in the energy of the processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we planned to increase prices by 6.8 per cent, in weighted assets by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in the past month increased by 1.1 per cent in July compared with the previous month, by 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic payment for one month has decreased by 1.7 per cent in the euro, then by 7.1 per cent in the dollar, compared with July 2007, it has increased by 7.5 per cent in the euro and by 15.9 per cent in the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to King G√ºntz, it is a great hope that the U.S.-Major Agreement on visa-free status will enter into force on 12 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has spoken on this subject in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her view, "it is now almost all about whether an electronic road permit system is being built in the sea at the time, and the respective controls".
She also warned that the part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, while tourists would have to be allowed to register before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomat from today is continuing in meetings in Washington.
He meets with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Condoleezzo Rice, who gives the Central Cross to the Governing Body for hearings about the Republic of Hungary and gives talks to the Foreign Policy Adviser of the Democratic Party of Baracka Obamy and Republican John McCainaina.
Barack Obama and McCain are for package on saved bank
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates from both large American parties, agreed on Sunday's support for the government package at $700 billion saved by the bank, and there are also policies that require the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few days of meeting with Congress and the representatives of the administration, it was announced on Sunday early: the basic package agreement on the bank‚Äôs savings agreement was concluded.
A financial package aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is accordingly designated as the most suitable candidate of both candidates who would emerge from the economic crisis.
According to the most recent studies, at the same time as they got to the front of the economic issue, Obama gained a certain benefit again, and McCain's stroke, which he had secured after the Republican Convention, appointed Sarah Palin to post vice-president.
Both expressed their hope on Sunday at the pre-election meeting in Detroit that the package law would be 700 billion quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passports relating to consumer protection, which also supported it.
"We must act now, responsible for your places, for example, for the entire industrial sector, for the stability of the entire economy is at risk," said the 35th tax.
He didn't take the opportunity to call McCaino's economic ideas old-fashioned.
McCain, in his interview with the ABC TV station, said: "It's going to be a bit of a reason... but no Sunday is just a way."
As indicated by the Republican Senator, the proposal includes the Commission's organisation of the Minister for Finance and the restriction on the position of the High Representative.
Both CBS stations announced that McCain did not play a more important role in meetings, but he himself was in touch with the minister.
The shadow president Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the shadow representatives would vote on the proposal of law almost Monday.
Print overview of the German language area
The legal camp is uninterrupted, only its volunteers have become more aware of it - so analyzes the poor result of CSU in Bavorsk Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Rakouska to prevent red-black coalitions.
Mirror (spigel.de)
In the online release of the left German news store, Franz Walter writes in his article entitled "Bavorska revolution burns his father" because of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known politician, CSU virus began long before its authority took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
Throughout the decade, Christians have been restoring Bavaria - and now they are rejecting these very modern citizens.
Centralization of the period is the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and so is Angely Merkel.
Debakl was not completely surprising for CSU, but ended on Saturday a process that could have been predicted for almost ten years: an ongoing hegemony of one state party ended.
Over the past ten years, in 1998, the CSU has grown to 47.7 per cent, first from the 50th year below the 50% limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to Bundestag in 2005, which is still so often mentioned in Stoiber's period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that burns its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but in time they have been very mistaken. Securitisation, educational results, the dispersion of the Germans from the east and the north of the developing regions of the Bavarian regions have still not been able to be without the consequences of the faithfulness of the CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to increasing opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The legal camp is uninterrupted, only its voters have become more conscious, more critical, more self-evident.
It is also evident that in recent weeks CSU has been the most advanced by just a classic civil society; people in freedom of choice, bioequivalents, adults and high school education.
The CSU has already been supported by less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who, with whom? The President's parties are in the issue of the coalition of sustainability" the Conservative Day calls for a confusing internal political situation caused by the radical elections.
You need to talk to the OVP first.
The OVP shall order the involvement of SPAs in its internal affairs.
BZ√ú is as open to all meetings, greens still don't want to belong to the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public law television, the President's party has left much to be seen in their cards.
President Werner Faymann confirmed that he had previously spoken with the OVP.
And the SSP wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some partner countries and in social partnership.
The question of whether it is possible to introduce coalition with Wilhelm Moreter, the current president of the √ñVP as vice- chancellor, left Faymann open.
As it turned out, Sch√ºssel-Molterer's course was voted on every floor.
This Directive is not to be taken into account.
Multer responded to the rough offers carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition, he is still quite open on the side, these issues must be addressed in a decisive manner within the CFSP.
The President of BZ√ñ J√∂rg Haider has once again been open to all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalitions, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Jaroqu√≠: There is a need to break the preserved bread of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which is hosted by France this year, has begun the current Presidency of the European Union.
Livia J√°≈ô√≥k, a delegation of the European People's Party for the arrest of Fidesz, as one of the main speakers of the professional years in her mission, drew attention to the segregation in school, as this is one of the most serious injustices facing Roma children, as well as the most serious obstacle to their use.
The summit began on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir ≈†pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The annual meeting took place between the invited governments, European social partners, the most prominent European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of European MPs, Fidesz J√°r√≥kov√° warned that, despite the discrimination experienced at the gathering of labour forces, Roma are expelled from the European labour market, particularly from their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of basic education, can only achieve higher levels of education that are inadequate."
Jarok further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the delegation, it is necessary to establish the knowledge of these relations in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
As soon as this Roma student starts school, there will be a greater chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by means of income tax and consumer tax, they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their lack of quality and separate education by their citizens of the European Union," Livia J√°r√≥kov said.
According to the delegation, there is a need for the European Union's consistency with a focus on achieving an immediate acceleration of school de-organisation processes, and for this to be a priority, it is essential to maintain the correctness of existing anti-discrimination regulations.
"There is a need to break the hidden scourge of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to give Roma children the opportunity given by the democratic space so that they can share as a full-time citizen in the future of Europe," J√°r√≥k asked.
Each of the "European Year of Equal Opportunity" aims at ensuring a single forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination at the level of Europe as well as of individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary charity
On the judgment of the du du du Du Du Du Du Duo Huber-Beckstein to be decided at the end of October
Despite the rest of the electoral debate, the debate on personal issues had already been rejected by the Bavarian CSU.
The president of Erwin Huber and the country Prime Minister G√ºnther Beckstein can still stay in their places, the question is, until this mercy is established.
On the judgment of the Tandem who suffered the disastrous 17% loss of votes, the last October weekend was a special convention of the parties.
In any case, members of a highly criticised spirit have been allowed to hear that they will not fall from all their ranks.
They tried to calm down the divided members of the group and the fundamentals that, because of the loss of the absolute majority, required the day after the "bavorous cuenas" export of personal effects.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of the career - she gained 60.7% of the Christian-Social Union, now, year after year against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her strength was enough.
CSU has been producing 18 per cent of Germany's "self-government" in Bavaria for 46 years.
Conservatives in the Southern Community continue to play a key role for the Hungarian economy, high positions, but will be forced into the coalition in the future at any time.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of the team of experts which are conducting a polling meeting on the case-by-case coalition of the minority government with the liberal FDP, with the right-oriented collection of the Free Volunteers, will also be the Vice-President and the Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the possible Huber's representative.
It is ironic that, at the invitation of the Free Volunteers, Gabriel Paul arrived in the dream, whose appearance against Stoiber was used by Duo Huber-Beckstein to conduct the race, but then by ambitious municipal policy they did an inhumane short process.
The lead representative of the CSU is now focusing all its energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the past period, Stoiber also had an active role to play, which has so far been directed by the former prime minister of the country and has been called by the President of the CSU on 28 September on the most patient day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber drew a number of favorable notes to the CDU address, which he said would be much more supportive of the sister side.
Other CSU policies interpreted the defeat as a warning also for the CDU and Angel Merkel.
Following elections to the Bundestag, which took place in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a Chancellor if CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, does not have a role to play in the common forces.
According to Merkel, who has been unable to hide his corruption because of the failure, he will not have lost CSU's negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
What is of course relative: to cure the injured CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democracies will continue.
SPD reached Bavaria with 18.6 per cent of the worst result since 1946.
Luka≈°enko:oposce - 110:0
On Sundays, there was no opposition messenger in the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by the Russian observers for prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexandre Luka≈°enken, and by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) which has come to account for the votes.
The Committee, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the vote.
Although the 110 member-member legislative body of 10 million countries has been dealing with opposition for well ten years, the opposition brought together by the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections was seriously hoping that Luka≈°enko, who had left behind on the basis of changes to the constitutions in the elections with a debateable period in 2006, and the fourth to renew its presidential mandate, this time "allowed" to appear in Parliament several opposition parliamentarians.
The ODS has left this way since the previously considered battle.
In the wake of the opposition, it was expected that Russia's economy would continue to be more and more dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the devastating Russian imports of Earth's gas, had gained confidence and also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the country's own pipelines, was getting into Russian hands - to improve relations with the European Union, where because of the Belarusian political arrangement assessed as an anti-democratic Luka≈°enko and other high political positions did not get access.
It was previously shown that when assessing the preliminary campaign, the OSCE was focusing on positive positions and no lack of, for example, on a ban on candidates for third-party candidates.
The EESC's report on Monday had already benefited from the campaign, while opposition candidates could not in fact appear in the press, in particular that opposition could not be able to count votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released for freedom, and Minsk is willing to travel with Moscow and to less confrontation if it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia's withdrawal from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, perhaps Russia, with which Belarus is forming a federal state paper, these two countries are considered independent for months.
"We have taken two steps forward and one way back, but most importantly, he has started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our list, Alexandr Milinkevic.
According to the opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is urgent that this remain, even though "too much is willing to be admitted to a single opposition member's single parliament".
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest action, but rather strives to provide voters with his report on the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition lists in Russia, distribution of the blockades of the local authorities, but I see that the change continues to support as many people as possible, including the older ones," Milinkevic said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security, does not necessarily or officially support the type of taxpayers.
"Because of the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security 'increasing silence' is breaking," Milinkevic says.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers of elections have been assessed as democratic.
The Community-led mission of the independent states of Sergei Lebedev, the Russian news agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe in words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the growth of white voters.
Brunetta: "From this morning before work"
It's the first in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was built on the back door at the arrival and departure of employees.
From now on, however, this new measure will begin to work against anointed ones, against what they are doing and then go to coffee at work.
News against Lennox was introduced today by Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunett, and Secretary-General of Presidential Council Maurem Massi.
"The back door - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presentations and more services," said the Minister.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency shall not be opened.
It's about reformism," continues Brunetta.
At the Chigi Palace, we will complete the entire Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of the Father's doors is also important from a symbolic perspective".
There were no intentions by employees, the Secretary-General said: "There was a common procedure with all workers and cooperation".
In short, no breakfast at work; no coffee and no croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a good cappuccino in seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Professional Schools for Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister finally announces that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has reduced by 50%, which means that there are 60 000 people more than one year's work".
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective.
"its cost dynamic ‚Äì explained by the Minister ‚Äì has doubled over the past 8-10 years due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have met to reject the standards of Brunett's decree in accordance with the request of Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures relating to lower unemployment due to disability ‚Äì written by the Consumer Protection Association ‚Äì the 'full Lennox' nation continues to grow.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to report the war against illegal standards contained in the decree."
In particular, Taru will be protested against the exclusion of disability due to activities; the extension of the period during which disease control is possible, the duration of the control visits will be carried out and other rules included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour Force, Napolitano: "Desolute Prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 jobs, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain disabled.
The Inail values confirm that by 2007 we have a total of 1,200 deaths due to the labour force.
These values bear witness to the importance of an event that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double death compared to killings.
In order to regain the attention of the institutions, social and information media regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil is now celebrating in all 58 Italian regions on the second Sunday of October of the National Day of the Victims of Labour Offices.
"The disturbing data spread by Anmil and the tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of safety of work is," President of the Republic of Georgia Napolitano confirms in a report sent by the President of Anmil, the National Association for Cold and Disabled Persons for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State shall express its strong view of the continued joint effort on safety at work, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of families of victims and the participation of public opinion."
"Naturally there has been an 'applicable' raised, which is truly shared in the face of a tragedy that causes media and public opinion disturbances, but every day the reality offers us again dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in education and information.
In particular, there are numerous initiatives in the field of education to help young people to gain a clearer understanding of the world‚Äôs work.
It is necessary to warn of this danger, not to give up because of its disturbing social burden, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed by his side that "how even death results from the labour force creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and encourages all institutions to a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state."
"As regards the data of labour agencies, it appears that they show a certain positive business, but this does not indicate that the number of deaths due to labour costs is as alarming as such," recalled President Anmilu Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this "reduction force" to take a little less attention, because right now, when it comes to attention, the tragedy will come out.
"We believe that it is generally too much to stop the problem of infections and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - to highlight Mercandelli ‚Äì to increase control and inspection, but also to focus more heavily on the training of workers, and this right away from school age."
"There is still another need for effort - he added - concerning communication and participation in public opinion.
But it is mainly necessary to have a greater sense of responsibility for employees in relation to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social advantage."
Mercandelli finally announced that the progressive degeneration of the level of rights to vulnerable victims of labour and the "rejecting of support care" to which the system is being provided in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the employee's insurance guarantee ‚Äì he added ‚Äì because the fate of those who suffer must not depend on spontaneousity or time-consuming as a lawyer."
Mp3 Player accused, exposed to risk
Listening to music over a long period of time and using portable music devices as a Mp3 player can cause permanent damage to the ear.
According to a European Commission notice published today, which is published in one official report in Brussels, citing the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks that have recently emerged and have been identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view ‚Äì we read in the notes ‚Äì it is clear that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years through portable music devices, week after week more than one hour a day and hold the device at high volume, risk permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"It worries me that so many young people who use frequent portable music devices and mobile phones on high-level acoustics can unwittingly harm their ear in an uncorrectable way," admits Megena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings ‚Äì continues to lead ‚Äì there is a clear risk and there is a need to respond quickly.
Most importantly, we have to raise consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-check existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they can become fully effective and take steps with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable music equipment and the growing number of young people exposed to this source.
"Scientists ‚Äì closed by Executive Officer Eu ‚Äì confirm that it is necessary to take care and now the European Commission will check together with other members and parties who have faced the problem which measures could possibly be taken and thus better protected children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable music devices and similar devices."
At present there is a European safety standard which limits the level of volume of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concerns about damage to hearings which can be caused by excessive exposure to similar sound formats are growing.
It is very possible to limit these damages by seeking solutions such as lowering levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the Eu indicates that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) within a period of only five hours a week, shall now exceed the applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions over a long period of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be calculated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free process for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have a sum in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli workers "Commission for the Future of Rome's capital", which took place this morning at its new headquarters in the Caracall Valley.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission shall make their letters to Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will assess the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with a "official survey" of Campidoglia and his former Gianni German.
"The Commission is completely independent and contains all political, social and cultural ideas ‚Äì to highlight Germany ‚Äì will have to ensure the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political decision-makers remaining in Gionta e General Council.
It's not about any change of function, but it's about trying to have a place where to process a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved because this institution must have a precise time limit.
In June ‚Äì announced by the elder ‚Äì we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome.‚Äù
In view of the fact that its opinions are not binding on the Commission, the German reply says: "All depends on the work which the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are quality, as proposed by the Attalis Commission, and I am sure that in Rome, its result will be decisive.
Too often policy will be paid for every day‚Äôs problems and emergencies that will arise from time to time.
We, however, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the elderly Roma want to stress that "this Commission is neither a major business nor a bluff: it is completely free, Roma citizens will not be able to get a euro and serve to think and engage in the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Germany, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, not a definitive or non-movable point, so that it is possible for our city to be able to afford an authentic rise to the level it needs and think of a united spirit for its future."
The future, which, explains the old Roman "will not only be limited to the current common border, but will continue to look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal statute, but also "including the role that Rome can and must play as the main city of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president, he knows why.
One well-known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decided the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Flights against Obama are growing right when the election date is near.
A woman from Miami wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambition.
But both have the strength: they think they'll get to the highest position of the nation, which has all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't say much; they're attacks of a very racial origin and they don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have research; everyone says Obama wins and with a big jump.
In this case there are those who walk by heart, not by mind.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the south coast of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling office we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There's a page of American mentality on the surface that's been leaking up to the last minute.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves if both of us or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been mentioned before, seem almost certain of the success of a black candidate.
But above all these points for democracy is George Bush's main weapon.
1,500 people asked: What errors did Bush make during his mission? Eighty nine percent replied: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost tens of thousands of soldiers and sent him home with a cop to his ass.
In Iraq the lives of 4500 soldiers were spared and the Americans were not forced to fight.
And yet, Iraq became the main cause of Bush's weakness.
Whoever comes to the place of Georgia W will have to carry out a huge task.
The economic collapse of the U.S. has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many accuse the Internet, "killer" of printing.
PEW Research Center asked about the position of five journalists in their professions and predicting the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they had less age in terms of reliability.
I don't feel isolated like ever.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In addition, drawings carried out in the newsroom, in the rooms where editors work to give together the news are a huge problem.
According to the journalists concerned, there is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as it understands its broad public.
The U.S. journalist is making a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the journalist is making a wrong path in the national measure.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
It was printed against the Broadcast.
It's not hard for a journalist to see where the web is going.
Larger publishing takes the way to the Internet, which many consider to be a "killer" of printing.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are warning about has increased by 79%.
Five hundred of the journalists interviewed admitted that they were turning to technology in hopes that their journalist would "be doing something good".
The biggest disaster in the U.S. press is between those who run the newsrooms ‚Äì it means leaders ‚Äì and the reporters who work for them.
56% of those taking the lead at national level are sure their reporters share their values, while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with a real job.
Leaders who think they're losing their jobs for three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving to 30%.
As far as "true work" is concerned with staff (our editors, etc.) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In such a large nation as Usa, three million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, televisions and the Internet often offer what they want, so it is a question to take or leave them.
Drivers get almost always huge payments and the editor can make even tens of thousands of dollars a month without paying the money and insurance.
As regards the permitted persons, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, U.S. journalists, according to their own experience, are often sick within a year.
It's just a climate question.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPOLA OF THE GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to refuse to give up the business with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he be able to move from his city, Grottaferrat, to live in Rome.
Coppola is examined for bankruptcy related to the anti-subsidy at the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at its own expense, he received last week's release from the domestic prison, which was changed to a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real-time entrepreneur be able to change the place of residence from the foreign city to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (to which pm was expressed against) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he is accused.
The elites are in danger
A few days ago, Komora's representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide 700 billion dollars to the White House: a significant part of the Americans were more interested and interested in the destruction of Wall Street than in the saving of the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis is spreading to the Republican side, the more divided between its old East Coast soul, the more peaceful, hostile to the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to the 'those from Washington' and towards the world of finance, particularly in the middle and southern states.
The soul that was proud of the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this is just an example of the major changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not only in the United States but also in the whole West and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe it seems that this crisis is acting as a wave accelerator that has been incubating for a long time, which are moving into the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these streams is re-upgradation, exceptional market recovery, the second category of State power in relation to certain economic renewal.
The crisis is the result of the crisis of banking institutions which, of course, have a strong gap in foreign affairs, but are mainly involved in the largest number of people and families living in the same country, in the same state.
What has created a political problem for those who are leading it at the same time: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are beyond the reach of others.
The short crisis is one of the economic worlds, but politics is almost extremely national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially outside the game or has nothing to do with it: clear evidence has been provided by the European Union, which is always divided between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided for one common policy line.
And so everyone is waiting for the principles of governments of each individual state, savings plans, market recovery, new rules and mainly the distribution of funds: at the moment when we get to the press, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to try to put everything in order.
And also the own resources and justification necessary for them to be used: two sources of non-peaceable value, under certain circumstances, which may not be possible in any other market or international organisation.
This new era, which is facing state-national origin crisis, is at last in line with the ever greater importance that the recent economic progress is trying to contribute to one factor linked to it: territorial relevance.
In fact, paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the network, we were becoming more sophisticated technology, material, while we were convinced that global finances were already being transferred to control the world, from nothing we knew that our future would have to be more and more involved with such small non-material things as water, oil, oil.
All things that would have been said could have been moved from one place to the other on the ground, however, are connected, absolutely, to the restricted area, the land.
So, whoever becomes their leader, he certainly has much more carats in his hand than he does and he who has the courage to live in a place of no water, no oil and no water.
I'm getting to a second newspaper, but it's going to be worse.
Who's talking about the territory, the state, the government, it's talking about politics and leadership.
Given the economic crisis, it appears that there are two convergence gaps.
On the one hand, it is a sense of objectively the need for authoritative guidance, a request for someone who could understand the situation.
On the other hand, there is a lack of confidence in existing guidance, particularly economics, which has shown itself to be equally inadequate and full of dark places.
And together there is something even deeper and in a certain sense confusing: distrust, intolerance, feelings of incompetence and incompetence which are trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is still more widespread public conviction than their actions are the same as the ideas of popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense, that elite has already exceeded its time and is hostile to the views of most.
The requirement for leadership is short-lived under one wind, but strong impetus for the removal of the ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in recent "wars" or in unexpected changes in collective power in recent and recent times, from the conservative entry to the fall of British workers to the opposition of American congressmen against Bush (and may also have the right to win in Italy).
We have the idea that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more problems to understand, so to represent what, not today, is being created in the deep forms of Western societies and that the economic crisis is again strengthening, widening, potentially preventing the climate.
Before this, it would be stopped to talk about permanent "mass pressure".
But of course we can't say that it means having a proper eye.
Super slipper for moving by walls
Triumph the laws of gravity thanks to the super leaf and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centres and has now been very close to the four institutions.
The scientists were able to maintain a glass of glass in a vertical wall with only one inch [2.5 cm] square.
STUDIUM ‚Äì The American journal Science published the findings of some university researchers at Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material discovered by the research team is the development of existing materials that use a particular carbon structure called carbon turbulence tubes.
"The base of the carpet we can imagine as a series of tubes placed as an organized spaghetti hall," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of a gecon, covered with microscopic knots that allow animals to ensure a perfect landing.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper showed that the new leaf is ten times stronger than the legs of these beaches and at the same time "just disappears from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering College of Dayton University.
CHODIT FOR ZDECH? -"This material could be useful as a provisional label" adds Liming Dai.
Is it possible to walk through the air like Spiderman? Is it? Yes, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use than the connection of electrical devices, because tropical carbon tubes are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications could be related to air space engineering .
I don't miss any super hounds.
DESCRIPTION ‚Äì The University of Berkley, California, is also committed to the research of the new leaf.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a patch shaped from a micro-wave as hair that cleans itself from dust to keep perfect touch.
Medicines: Never
Watch your throat, smelly and yellowish.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly during summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, you will experience changes in your strength or your efficacy with serious health consequences.
So that David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, highlights the risk of juicy, both pure and pure in combination with some medications, at the 263 national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, creates new fears: one drop of influenza, measles and jaundice to reduce the life-threatening effects of certain life-threatening drugs, to cancel their positive effects and expose the health of patients.
Grep juice has already been accused of increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, antihistamines and neurological medicines.
RISK IN RISK ‚Äì The Italian Medical Agency has announced this in an information bulletin two years ago and has published doctors and patients not to underestimate the risks arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they are taking if they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEJEN GRAPEFRUIT ‚Äì According to the experts, the measles and apple juice also contain substances that induce drugs.
Long list of effects of fluephritis and other jockeys.
This is why Michele Carruby, director of the Department of Pharmacology of State University in Milan: "These findings are most immediately announced to the most diverse international and national medical agencies, which may order and exchange information on medicines.
So always read the list of medicines you get and if you find something unclear, do not hesitate, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain it¬ª, the expert for Ansa.
Nobel for the Economics of Paul Krugman
Nobel Prize was awarded to US Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is 55-year-old Novoken√´n who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms about the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
Several months after the attacks in September 2001, on the day that Enron, Krugman, announced in one comment published in New York Times that the second event will, in the light of the impact on the history of the United States, be far more important than the first.
The speaker who raised no arguments and who was counted after the year, however, proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked by the rapid collapses like Enron and Worldcom, Krugman announced at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenz Bini Smaghi of the Executive Board, the Central European Bank is Krugman "a key player", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excess of Bush's liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package here.
It is the day of issue of Open Office.org 3.0, a package open source of personal products that leads to the sale of more users from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After the annual work of volunteers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide audiences with different news: the lighting screen and the revised and improved open-window window are added, far more importantly, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The team is ready to work with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document and with Microsoft's new connection (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special functions of some models such as allowing to reduce the presentation of PowerPoint, useful for example for the transmission of electronic road, or the possibility to transfer the PDF component to the model of the graphic implementation and keep the original page view.
From this perspective, we can still create documents "PDF hybrids", which look like typical graphics in Adobe format and have the properties of a tabular processor or text program.
Cooperation is the first one that has achieved many improvements within the application programmes: it is extremely possible to work among different users and avoid conflict on change, each of the staff members is assigned one colour for comments in order to be more clearly identified in the audit phase.
Some companies also work to transfer some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should end up with final results.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, which is on the bridge.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent at the request home or at the workplace.
And if the issue of unemployment can be a burden on the expansion of households, just in the business area of the Open Office package is very close, and it can already be counted with the most diverse projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that leads to Excel's reward; Impress for presentation like Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more popular access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5th million downloads, and when we consider that we are about 3 million and 600,000 today, with the release of a new version it is possible that this expected number may also be exceeded.
Also Kohl results are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it's Rakustiana Bernhard Kohl, from the group of Gerolsteiner, the third classed and won the triumph of the best summit.
The report was read by L'Equipe's journals.
26th-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner on Cera, Epo third generation, after Italian Richard Rico and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Geraldsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohl fall into those performed in the last weeks of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Cera, Rakushan will lose third place on Tour and will have to face a fixed two-year disqualification.
The positive report of Kohl on the third generation confirms the French Anti-Doping Agency chief Pierre Bordry, who announced Associated Press that he had already reported the outcome of the Raquez government.
At 26 years of age, Rakushan took his place in the ranks of the Spanish Carlos Sastrem and the American Cadel Evansema, and also won the scored trick of the best summit.
Immigrant: The New York Team, is it Italian racist?
Italy "as a country of immigrants only changed to the priority objectives of immigrants" accepted with support.
So it's in a long New York Times article that was discussing racism in Italy and started with young Abdula William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole the garbage.
This case illustrates what New York Times defines as "the North Paradox": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the weakest anti-trafficking thinking in the country and the strongest support for the North League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italy and the immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
That's not it.
The new legislation required by the League, which seeks to boost immigration and facilitate the recovery of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of climate change in Italy.
The trend, highlighted by the pope, was that of the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, requested that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Students with low-cost rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent studies, Sunia, rental committees, can rent a single-room apartment for students in Milan up to 900 euros, Florence 700, Naples 650, Rome 600.
"It has already reached such proportions that all classes of students have lost the right to study because of the total too high prices that their families would have to pay ‚Äì explains the leading study office for Sunia, Laura Mariani ‚Äì in this city a large demand from students has shaped the market in such a way that it has initiated a process of increasing prices that has also spread to residents."
In most cases, rental offers include several offences: contracts in a free, unregistered way, without limited rentals, associated with them.
For Sunji, there is a need for an exceptional approach which could regulate prices by means of the tax review.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianz, there is a need for a single bed of approximately 450 euros, for a single room at a minimum price of 650 (bande Nere zone) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence there is one bed in average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the university, there is a need for EUR 250/280 per bed in double room, from 370 to 500 per unit.
In Rome in the central university districts (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want a total of 600 euros per single room, 450 beds per double room.
The values are slightly lower (EUR 550 per unit) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecity).
We will only save if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestin, Centocelle and similar.
In Naples there is a need for 300/450 euros, for room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
They want 250/350 euros in Bari, at least 350 for single room.
In smaller cities, prices are significantly lower, but they have a higher impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most commonly rented for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomalies: an increase of 25-30% of the salary they want for foreign students compared to Italians.
Welcome to the old film Paradise, the cities of the ruins of historic villages
The cinematographic history halls end in the benefits of Multiplex.
"The city without kin is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornator has successfully documented what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in foreign cities.
The process of restricting the kine, the birth of large multinationals in the city and the subsequent disappearance of monosals in the central areas of the city is one of the events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a genuine cultural crime.
A lot of historical places are full of memories,"it's like we're here about a friend, a friend we've shared with, a lot of emotions," says the director of New Kiana Paradise, a film that was won 20 years ago by Tornator Oscar and a large court price in Cannes, which has exposed the poise of one neighbor's cinema and the sadness of the way of life that perhaps lost it forever.
The values obtained by Anek, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 kin of the traditional type closed door, and the highest number paid in the most important cities: 10 min in Florence, 9 min in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 min in Turin, 5 min in Palermo.
Among the regions most achieved closures, Emilia-Romagna has lost 82 Chinese halls followed by Tosk√°n (44) and Lombardy (41).
And I prove that the first responsibility for their meal is the rise of multiplexes, just the three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new Chinese multinationals: 195 more payments in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 as well as in Tuscany, and in Emilia-Romagn√°.
"Italian procedure has evolved irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that the existing ones are alive because when one film closes the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
We are not even talking about a lack of funding in the interests of operators: the previous state debt is EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Support for the sector would require between 16 and 18 million euros per year.‚Äô
It is an interesting case in Bologna, the first Italian city to care for the closures, which decided to find an Eastern signature of the protocol between the towns and Anecs, the first one in Italy for the protection and promotion of small Chinese as well as in the historical centres and on the subject.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax incentives in favour of operators and the benefits for the public in terms of mobility: the fans will be able to live in areas with limited transport and will have special prices for stopping and some parking.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of God by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that if it is possible to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional rooms must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more attractive.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was really important: the closure of Super Kiana in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and upbringing, was a short one that convinced me to establish "New cinema Paradise", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been passing through already closed Rialt or Quirinale at the National Street, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't look at written dust, I'll turn around on the other side."
Consistency between the political and mafia group 'dranghet, old Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man from Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the choices of the city authority according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli."
The charges brought by the leadership against the Mafia in Kalabria against the old and vice-stars of Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the old Rosarna Carlu Martellim, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organisation are difficult.
In railways also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the name of the chief who has already been charged with committing mafia crimes, worth 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as healthy reasoning," writes state officials, when two local authorities expressed their desire to pay counsel to Piromallim.
"This would allow the Mafia Group ‚Äì the written judges ‚Äì to officially enter the city authorities and make it possible to control and manage public administrations so much."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazione Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime are very much in his country: "There are areas in which the centre of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that resist the pressures of 'dranghets', the horns that are still unrevealed."
This morning's arrests are followed by the July of the previous year , which the police have shown that the Mafia group of Piromalli has received the final penalty .
Since the end of last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the proposed merger between organised crime and local government has been a result of the fact that local policies have been released into the public administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the resolution, the head of the coalition of the right middle after the fierce elections in May.
He called for a scandal when Prefectura ordered the General Council's release.
He called for the responsibility of the former Minister of Interior, Marc Minniti, and accused him of having made it all for political reasons, but the judges in the prison regulation signed this morning explain that the Mafia group had even reached the point where it requested an amendment to the A3 project.
Among the other statements made against Dal Torrion, a public prosecutor, was quoted as saying "the ability to transfer business orders, representatives of some larger groups very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and to adapt public services to the interests of the Mafia group."
When energy comes from the waves, they get into this big game.
It is an endless logic that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by major world energy companies.
The waves, floods, floods, floods are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the air of the cholera like Chevron, which is now trying to lift up its hands on these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea moves has been studied for more than a hundred years and in the 1970s in relation to the first major crisis has intensified research.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy went side by side. But now the organic organisation and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
In 2007 the World Energy Council (WEC) in London announced that about 15 per cent of global electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave wave movement.
this quantity would be a double energy unit currently manufactured in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are floods and floods and floods.
He'll attack the other side.
The company which engaged in marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to set up a facility in northern Portugal.
When this purpose was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years, which is based on marine energy, there are still more companies, which are more likely to be on marine energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology ‚Äì he is speaking to a company that is connected to the United States' hot-collar in the economic newspapers Wall Street Journal ‚Äì and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we consider to be about obtaining permission from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the discharge of the project for the use of marine energy on Alja≈°ce.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we consider that just on Alja≈°ce USA is still in trouble and President Bush has recently come up with a plan for a new round.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and so on invested sums, although not known in detail, show growing interest by observers.
Technology, the core needs to be developed.
The experts are talking about technology that is still in the first place because they don't know what will affect the use of marine energy in the environment.
In the past, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to have caused major problems to the ecosystem.
But it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment for greater energy production.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of colors that are interconnected with each other.
The force of the wave that moves against the top and bottom battles is modified by the help of the warriors and cylinders on the hydraulic pressure inside these forces.
The pressure is diluted by a turbine that supplies energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the coastal cables.
In the past, there are four devices of this type, which are only expected for federal approval and part of the energy could serve military purposes.
On the other hand, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping center and parking lot using six pdmorine turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during spring and spring causes the turnover of turbines, which is the result of this reverse movement, the generator lives.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of customers who are waiting for the necessary authorisation because of the possibility of using this energy.
By the waves, by the tide and by the tide.
A particular interest is now worth the potential for electricity research in the Institute of Energy.
Although this is an independent factor, the currents and emissions are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, and therefore more reliable than the source of energy.
At the same time, countries such as New York, Maine and Alja≈°ka have already invested 7 and half a billion dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
