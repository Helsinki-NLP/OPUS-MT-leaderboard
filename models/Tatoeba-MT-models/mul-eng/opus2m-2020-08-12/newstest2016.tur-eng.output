She admitted she killed her girlfriend by calling Professor 911.
Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911 University, said that the police had shot his girlfriend and that the police had to come home.
Lamb indicated that "the beloved dog" is alive and probably sad and that the dead woman's family's phones can be found on her cell phone.
The police found Amy Prentiss' body at home and a note written in a white notebook, "I'm sorry, if I could get everything back, I loved Amy so much and she's the only woman I love until now."
There was no indication that Lamb, who trained two translators for the University of Delta State in Cleveland, had been shot and killed in front of the Lamb's office by his favorite history professor Ethan Schmidt.
The Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the authorities were shooting at the university at 10:18 p.m.
He also indicated that Lamb had made 911 calls shortly thereafter.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb was brought to nothing as the police approached him.
One day after the school shooting students and professors were looking at what Lamb was still supposed to do because he was behind closed doors.
Both sides of the government have drawn up a well-known form of teaching by students and staff.
The students said they were waiting for him to come in.
A police officer in Gautier, Prentiss, who was killed, said that there was no record of the crime and murder of Lamb.
Even Schmidt spoke as one of the "other people" who shared his academic life with Lamb in a book he wrote.
They were both trained in the Social Sciences and History Department, which was listed by 17 students in the school, and they received a lot of training from both students.
There were also signs of spiritual problems.
From the student speaking from Lamb's ear, Brandon Beavers pointed out that he seemed to be a very worried and anxious person and "like he had a problem."
Another scholar, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb himself said that in the last years of the 2014-15 study, he was under stress.
Lamb had already found some health problems, and he asked for permission from the Delta State University.
This year he was just giving two lessons from the Internet.
The recent changes in the university's employment policies did not guarantee that Lamb's doctor was an automate, even though he worked hard to win.
Professor William LaForge of the University said he didn't know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "There are some things in Lamb's mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer report.
After the campus was released, the police stopped him on his way from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Court of Justice stated that his family, Methel Johnson, had only 38 calibrated guns in the backyard of a house about 1.5 km away from the house in Mississippi, Greenville, just before Lamb was arrested.
And Lamb's car was working in the car.
Well, if it's not clear why Lamb went to this house right away, Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew those who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started to work at the 3,500 student universities in the city of about 12,000 students in 2009 and was providing education and education.
He got his doctor in the field of education at first.
One of Lamb's old friends identified him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
When Carla Harston met her friends with her boyfriend, she said she was 15 Lamb's at the age of 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice person who tried to teach them how to play guitar for years.
At that time he was a fast-pained man.
A 40-year-old man who lived in Jackson, Brandon's town, said, "When he came, all the girls were here."
Lamb and Prentiss would have been together for a while.
There's no official record of their marriage if Lamb says "I killed my wife" at 911.
They had a dog named Lightning living with them in their locker houses on a riverside in Gautier.
The police said the dog's condition was good.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they were married 15 years ago, but they've always been friends with Prentiss and now she's a 19-year-old girl.
He also indicated that O'Steen's daughter was in a state of complete failure.
He and his mother were great friends.
She said she never met O'Steen Lamb, but she said that she heard from Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and stole blues.
They met Prentiss with Lamb when they went to a writing festival with Lamb three years ago.
Then Lamb and Abigail were played together in public shows.
O'Steen indicated that she wrote her daughter's music herself and said it.
Prentiss was a nurse working in various translation companies.
Mike Shaffer, who was also in the Julep Room, who had a lot of money at Gautier's side, said that he saw Mike Shaffer and Prentiss at the latest on 5th of September after Lamb had finished playing music.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we broke up and we sold each other.
They both had a great deal of espresso.
Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at the same university, said that Professor Schmidt, who was killed, conducted his first seminar on leadership and was an expert in local and colonial history.
She was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was the head of a team of students who formed himself.
On Saturday night, about 900 people, including academics, university staff, students, and visitors from local communities, attended the Delta State University campus in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt, also joined in the memory of the "Parlak Morning Star" and "Water Zarafet" music at the University.
The classes continue Wednesday.
LaForge said, "We're trying to bring our students back."
The crisis is a mess.
It's time to bury the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) were present.
The text of this message was adjusted to indicate that after Lamb killed Schmidt, the police called 911 and that Lamb referred to him as Prentiss as a "wife" at 911.
Toys R Us is planning to take over the Less-Tatil Season
Toys R Us explained that he would not take over the holiday season this year, but he indicated that the producer of toys and baby products would recognize the possibility of working more for seasonal workers.
The company indicated that 40,000 people were planning to work in the state-owned stores and distribution centres, and this number was 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be half-time.
The company indicated that hospitals will start in this month and that the number of staff will increase from October to May.
Although there are more months in the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is nearing and companies are ready to take on temporary workers who will help them with their sales, shipping and distribution.
Michael J. Fox, Prince Diana, and his "Link" work.
It's a very important moment for Michael J. Fox, the last part of the film "Return to the Past."
It was very important for personal reasons.
He explains in a document back in Time fragment that will enter the new vision: "We were waiting for the members of the Kingdom family sitting in my cinema to come and I realized that you were sitting there and I knew that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The film started, and I realized that going out with the Princess Galler was a false move and that it was a long way off.
Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, a documentary on the film "Resurrection of the Cross", includes reports by Robert Zemeckis and application maker Steven Spielberg.
He first came to see the future 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time of travel for me so far."
The back in Time VOD and DVD formats will also be shown in some selected movies.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
As Russia goes to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the issue of Syria 'will not be solved by a military dispute' and that more than a million weapons will only be more violent and painful for people.
The BM Secretary-General also invited the BM Security Council, which was divided into a political solution for all parties, to meet together and to hold political talks.
Ban indicated that five members of the Governing Council were planning to meet with the outside United States, China, Russia, England and France at the BM General Assembly meeting scheduled to be held at the end of the month.
The members of the Council and the Syrian people expressed great regret at the fact that regional powers had become "unsolved".
Ban invited five members to join in the Syrian crisis, just as Iran was in the nuclear agreement.
8 Survey Number Shown by Donald Trump
Some tried to label him as a fireman.
He accused the others of being suspicious of him.
And he supports some of them for internal explosions.
Some of the community members tried to pull Donald Trump down on the polls, but it didn't work.
The last 11 national polls showed him the priority of Donald Trump in two numbers, and some of them are starting to question seriously whether he has the chance to become the name of the real estate emperor.
Of course it's early in the election.
None of this means that Trump can win the civil war.
In 2011, officials were explaining why Rick Perry's elevation was too high for Herman Cain, and they didn't both win the same degree.
And there's a lot of reason why I choose to live hard.
However, such foreign groups as the Super PAC Group and the Big Red Club, like Jeb Bush, are aware of Trump's remaining power and are starting to spend their dollars on turning it off.
Here are some recent polls that show that the imperator is not just passing through:
The advantages of Trump's preference changed to 180 degrees.
A survey carried out at the University of Monmouth shortly before the birth of Donald Trump Haziran in the middle of the month revealed that two of the Republicans were present for the impalement emperor.
It was 40 percent in the middle of the month of December.
It was 52 percent early in August.
He's now under 10 of the Republicans who have a regular meeting on Donald Trump.
He's saying he's three of us out of 10.
And these numbers look high in early environments.
Last week, Iowa showed a poll in Quinnipiac that 60 percent of the Community's people prefer Donald Trump.
The three-thirds of GOP voters may be pleased with the reputation of Trump.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of the population said they would be either "coshkul" or "tatmin".
Only two of the 10 people said if they had that name, they would.
Only Ben Carson Trump creates a doll at the same level (e.g., when he says they'll be 43 percent "coshkul").
The closest one to Cochcu?
Only 21 percent of Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Community voters say they "will not" or "will" if Jeb Bush, who is a member of the organization's favorite organization.
Most of the community doesn't view Trump's scale as a problem.
Donald Trump thinks that when questioned by the US News/Washington Post polls, the market has a right balance of 52 percent of the citizens who are asked to be president of the real estate empire.
According to Quinnipac last week, the country's first party is going to be held in Iowa, and 52 percent of the people think they're going to be the leader.
He still thinks he doesn't have a person to serve as an active 44 percent, and according to the ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say he doesn't live up to the White Saray.
Community voters are starting to deal with this idea.
And when the political forces pull their political hats off, the Community's voters think that Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 people said that Trump was the best when it was asked who was best to win the GOP.
I'm another change since the end of the month of Tammuz that four people spent their money on Jeb Bush.
Perfect construction: In the past, GOP voters were not very clear on crystal surfaces.
During the last election period, he thought that out of 10 people in the community would be the name of Rick Perry, and he only chose Mitt Romney, the last 28 percent name.
Most GOP voters still see that Trump's election campaign has been slowed down.
Even if community members gather around another village, Trump still eats almost everyone.
Some scientists point out that the mountainous area can be found in front of Trump and that it is more than one level of support from Trump than one degree of adhesion.
However, a Monmouth University survey conducted at the beginning of July shows that in the case of an agreement between Trump and a large number of Community leaders, Trump received support at every time.
Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasach and Chris Christie with 33 points.
He's with Ted Cruz.
Is that the only way you can trust him?
Ben Carson's working with 19 points in case of an accident.
Donald Trump says the majority of supporters made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll published on Saturday shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump have said that they have locked up more than half of their votes.
Clearly, many things can be done to change this and no one can really say that no one will change his mind.
He said they left the door open to change 46 degrees.
The biggest brain surgeon in Trump is Ben Carson, but those who say they made their decisions are closer to voting for Trump.
10 of the Community says it's the same idea as Trump about migration.
Two months before the campaign, Donald Trump spoke to immigrants from Mexico, and it was moving to the center at the beginning of the 2016 talks.
Some think that the important Spanish voters of Trump's many talks have distanced themselves from the People's Party and will ruin their efforts to redefine.
However, according to a new ABC/Post poll on Friday, 10 of the Community's six migration issues are the same as Trump.
So it looks like Trump's going to stay in the sun as long as it's on the move.
The court heard in the government doesn't appeal to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are taking half of the community's games because they're out there.
In the new ABC/Post poll held on Friday, he says that every 10 Republicans wanted someone out of the government's office.
And they're angry with Washington.
Two weeks ago a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey conducted in Iowa showed that every four Community citizens in Iowa were exposed to the Third Community members of the Congress, 54 percent were "not fit" and 21 percent were "too angry".
The president's questions are about Jeremy Corby's first visit.
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn has been waiting for a turnout in the question programme.
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will take the lead after David Cameron's first visit to the President's Questions.
Mr. Corbyn will be asking six questions shortly after tomorrow, and his performance is like an intellectual by the Nationals' media and the Labour Party.
He called "lower theaters and more real" during the week.
He also said he could skip some of his sessions and leave them with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, his father's funeral and his speech at the TUC annual convention on Saturday.
In the meantime, some Tory Nationalists have been arrested by some of the Tory Nationals and in front of the press.
Mr. Corbyn has taken note of the decision not to have sex with the international race.
A speaker speaking on behalf of Mr. Corby said that he was standing in a "dark silence" and that he was referring to "the dignity of the Kingdom Air Force in the English War."
However, when Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet said that Owen Smith BBC Two, a member of the shadow cabinet, told the Labour Party leader that he would advise him to say "free" as an environmental mark on his belief in the removal of the monarchy.
When the economic, defence and external relations differences were due to close shadow, Mr. Corbyn refused to serve on the top team, he was supported by at least one of the parliamentarians as a leader.
BBC political spokesman Robin Brant points out that political differences in the Labour Party are also beginning to "assemble" and that these are matters for the EU's position on Mr. Corbyn and the Government's over-limiting application to aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had made new changes regarding the complete removal of the upper limit.
Hours later, Mr. Smith said that the party was against the government's lower limit of $26,000 and said it was "very obvious" in this regard.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth head of the 5th Party of Workers who will meet in the event of David Cameron's election as leader.
The Labour Party's leader made a different commitment to politics and told Mr. Cameron that he had received more than 30,000 "people" advice to ask him.
Islington told the North Millettvegian Prime Minister that the question programme was very exciting and that it would focus on the difficulties faced by young people instead of changing words with "adultization" instead of changing words.
Mr. Corbyn, when he wasn't there, for example when he went to Mr. Cameron's place, told the Prime Minister that he would be represented by Angela Eagle in the question-making program.
In fact, in time, other colleagues suggested that they should go out to this party and said that the Avám House spoke to John Bercow about taking this issue.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron has often admitted that he wanted to avoid the way of the Kukla policy associated with the question programme to the Prime Minister, but only a few years later, he admitted that he could not succeed in this particular.
From the history that was first published in 1990, it was also used as a basic measuring point to measure the decision-making capabilities of the leaders of the Question Programme, the administrations of the Avám Chamber and the locations of the National People's Party; it was suggested that some of the respondents felt that this was characterised and that there was a need for very comprehensive reforms.
'Drived in Joburg: Homeless Young People Take Photography Education
Johannesburg is a hard place for homeless people.
But a group of former street children won a new skill and found a way to make their way through it.
I was taken to Joburg, a studio where I learned how to take photos of homeless young people and learn how to get them out of this.
He went to meet one of the first messages of the BBC News project.

Sterling up steroids by speeding up increases in the United Kingdom
Following data showing the increase in payments in the United Kingdom, a rapid rise in sterility was seen, and FTSE 100 indexes were raised following the offer of purchase for SAB Miller.
In the United Kingdom, non-primary payments were recorded at an increase of 2.9 per year between May and Tammuz, according to the same period of the year.
This trend, which has been the fastest since 2009, is seen as one of the leading indicators for future fruit increases.
Sterlin won more than $1,5505 against US dollars, while against the euro she won $1,84%, and raised $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index raised 6,229,21 points to an increase of 1,49.
While the company that is the most prominent in this rise, its representative became a SABMiller's 20% increase in sales of gambling from the EU InBev.
This offer will bring together the world's largest two beer companies and brands known as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Bubberry's feelings were expressed with the impact of the real-time news from Richemont, a small group of white bears.
Richemont's modern sales figures also showed that the increase in sales in China, one of the closing markets for Burberry, is beginning to increase.
The fact that Glencore felt that he had received $2.5 billion after he explained that he had acquired the company's share of its debt reduction strategy.
The feelings of the Amba and paper group Mondi were among the most valuable feelings of loss of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs' failure to put his face in "Sat" for the company.
JD Sports's sensitivity to the company's six-month tax rate increased by 46.6 million esters with an increase of 83% after explaining that the company's share increased by 33.1 million esters.
JD Sports said it could harm the pattern of higher salaries.
JD Sports Management Board President Peter Cowgill said that the higher wage for workers in England could mean "more cost-effectiveness in the pockets of potential explosives".
However, he said that this cost-effectiveness would not be overestimated by the high-performance employees in his company.
He also added that it would affect JD Sports's expansion plans and that this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launched an international campaign to combat Aldi's will
Metcash, South Australia and Western Australia are trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi attack.
The Market Summit opened a public campaign to defend their stores in Metcash, South Australia and Western Australia against Aldi's will for 700 million dollars.
Aldi, in the early years before us, is preparing to open two distribution centres in South and West Australia and to open up their numbers first from stores to 120, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local dog tenderers and try to create the IGA brand with the main raw and social media markets and activities, such as Adelaide.
IGA breeders and tenderers are also in contact with brands like Dunsborough, the central dairy producer at the IGA stores, and their loyal customers, such as Simmo, who sell their registered football league tickets to South Australia.
The Guda, the drinking and the drinking are expected to provide more details about the defence strategy when Metcash's annual investment strategy was modified on 29th of July.
The risk represents almost 30 % of the IGA's high-speed marketing licenses in South and West Australia and represents the IGA's high-carbon margins in the countries of the eastern part of Metcash.
South Australia and Western Australia are the most powerful market share of IGA players in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; more than 30 per cent of the GA in the Eastern countries and more than 24 per cent in the BA.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take around 5% of the market market market within 12 months after opening the first stores in these two states, but that sales will usually be obtained by non-baptist players.
In a report published this week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, proposed that IGA players lose $360 million in one year and Metcash will lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This assumption is based on the assumption that Aldi will open a store in GA 25 and BA 30 each year, and that Aldi will buy me a sales number of $500 million and $600 million in every market.
Mr. Kierath said that the loss of cash and market sales and the losses of Metcash's high-ranking real estate base could cost Metcash some $13 million in advance of tax.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in the countries of the East, although Roy Morgan, who recently found that IGA's customers are the most loyal customers, is now in the process.
According to Morgan Stanley, the market price and market sales of Metcash will decrease by %4.1 in 2016, 2017 and by %2.1 in 2018, resulting in a return of market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglas, leader of the fund manager at a workshop in Melbourne, said that "Metcash could probably be removed in that year."
Metcash refused to sign Mr. Douglas's case.
But it's clear that a Metcash staff member has been in contact with Mr. Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has risen from 18% to 14%, and Metcash's gains from gambling and market work resulting from nearly 1200 IGA players have fallen from 2012 and 43% have been shown to have been reduced by the trade and marjore pressure.
But it turns out to be a top-up, helping IGA players to renovate their stores every year for fair prices similar to one hundredth of a week in Coles and Woolworths, and it adds faster and better to open up a brand-new series of markets.
Metcash, executive director Ian Morrice, says that the cost-equipment and shop upgrade programs are beginning to result and that the founder is expected to return to basic coal growth in 2017 for the first four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis, supported by Steve Healy, President of Tennis Australia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a lot of honor.
Tennis, Australia's leader Steve Healy, says that Thanasi Kokkinakis' friend Nick Kyrgyos was on the side of the last storm and deserves a lot of honor.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the professional two described as "Special Ks" in general, found himself under the light of the entertainment that he didn't like because of his hundred-thirty smile on Stan Wawrinka's Montreal Masters.
In the violent act that took place after dinner at Cincinnati, while apart from the law of the Kokkinakis and General Ryan Harrison twice, Harrison explained: "Wawrinka, I have to go over the kid."
In the last US Open, Kokkinakis was defended by Healy, who saw his rocket as a potential for losing Richard Gasquet's key.
A young player currently competes with Sam Groth in Glasgow, and at the end of the second round of Davis Cup, behind Bernard Tomic.
Healy spoke in the form of "What I've always felt like is a little bit of an argument about Thanasi."
He broke his rocket when he was in front of the U.S. and lost, but he's not the first player to fire because he's disappointed, and I know Thanasi realizes he shouldn't be proud of it too.
But in fact, he managed himself very well in the U.S., Harrison and others at the last provative level, and I think he deserves a full honor.
There's a great team on the network, a great family, and I think it's gone too far.
Although he's 19 years old, he's working very hard, and he's doing well with the team, he's got nothing to do with other players, he's being treated with respect to the rest of my room, he's doing hard training, he's finally being a decent young man, and I think he deserves to be judged in his own pockets.
Healy also supported the decision to welcome Kyrgios for important cooperation; from Cuma, he began to explain that he supported Canberran as a long-term vice president in order to make the right decision for everyone.
Healy said, "We want the team to focus on the game, not on the events around [Kyrgyos] first of all," he said.
And I think Nick, Federerer and Murray are as fast as people say, they're growing up in front of the people, and they're making some terrible mistakes, and they deserve all the things they've taken, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of their actions, and sometimes when he's not in the light of the sport, he thinks it's the right idea, the team and he's the best for himself.
Europe's migration crisis: Macedonia's rapid approach, borders closed and migrants were taken into consideration
Macaristan closed the south border with Serbia, and took note of those who were trying to get out of the country's illegal way of life on Saturday.
Hundreds of migrants gathered across the border, and Serbian authorities acted with caution.
Refugees who fled from violence in their own countries set up tents on the road for an uncertain period of time between control points of the two countries.
But they were growing up.
When a police helicopter went up there, the migrants called out, "Open the gate!" and fired threats from the mob police in Macaristan.
Some of them refused to be given water and food as protestors.
While moving from Serbia, Macedonia and Greece, the Foreign Office stated that it was "unacceptable" to send the migrants back to Macedonia.
(Serbia) He doesn't want to be a part of the solution since this period.
There will be meetings with Brussels and other countries in our days," Ivica Dacic Pragda said.
Within the border of Macedonia-Serbian, this aggression came to an end the very next day, without agreeing on a common migration policy at a meeting of 28 countries in Brussels.
The observers agreed on sharing responsibility for 40,000 migrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and expressed their hope that more than 120,000 more EU countries would be allowed to reach agreement between us by the month or year.
Germany's President Angela Merkel and Austria were invited to hold a week's EU summit to address this migration crisis on Saturday.
If Macaristan is, it's not very likely that he will take any action on the matter of Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency call given on Saturday in the two south-eastern regions provides broad-ranging authorities with regard to crisis-related issues, including the closure of roads where necessary and the speeding up of refugee cases.
On the other hand, Macaristan Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that he was planning to pull the bridge along the border with Romania to stop the flow of immigrants from Serbia.
CBS News told Charlie D'Agata that even prison courts were held in prisons when they tried to challenge Serbia-Montenegro.
In the last few months, Macedonia has become an important milestone and a transition point to the European Union, and most of these migrants have fled from the wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
President Viktor Orban, it's ironic that most of the immigrants who have come to war are "economically targeted migrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life to escape from the war - that's exactly what Germany has seen in other EU countries.
The laws that enter into the night in Macaristan bring more severe penalties to human refugees than to be subjected to a four-foot (13 feet) cross-border rape or injury.
In his statement to journalists in the city of Szeged in the south, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Government of Macaristan is moving quickly because of the situation in which the move is taking place."
In one case, our view is very clear: It is wrong to cross the border by illegal means.
Although the military has yet to be approved by the mayor, the Associated Press delegates in the region say they have seen dogs and warheads here today with heavy weapons.
Orban's local security speech, Gyorgy Bakondi, revealed that he had arrested 15 people who had crossed the border with 45 people who tried to cross the border with the authorities.
They've gone through a lot of trouble, and now they're accused of crimes against the police and new laws.
The authorities are speeding up the calls.
The Macar authorities also used a train train train that had to shut down two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Saturday morning, which was to close one of the crossings.
With a small metal container filled with pressure to perform the processes of the macarians, it was also near the largest border crossing point near the Kaos Roszke.
If 20 people could get inside, thousands of people would stay out.

Election 2016: Hillary's victory over Bernie Sanders was reduced to half of the national election
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two sides of the democratic struggle for national sovereignty, but you. Bernie Sanders is enough for him.
Clinton is now in second place with Sanders 27 (higher than 17) taking 47% of the Democratic Games (slower than 58)
President Joe Biden, who has not yet explained that he has not been in the presidential contest, takes 15% of democratic games.
About five months before the start of the main competitions, he was saying that most of the democratic elections were still very early to decide which island they would support.
But Clinton's supporters have better ideas about their own choices than others.
It's been a month since CBS News, Clinton lost its land between a series of demographic groups and some of Sanders' profits.
Clinton's got a big difference between women and scientists, but it's closing.
The support between the men was great there, and Sanders was only following him for five points.
Clinton's 50-year-old democratic election has been taking place, and he and Sanders are in the same place now.
But it's a big difference from Clinton's old election.
The last month, Clinton was making progress in front of Sander with two cuts between the Liberals, but now Sanders is five points in front of this group.
At the national level, it indicates that nearly half of the democratic voters will support Clinton while the party is on the island.
When a circle supports some conditions, another 15-year-old will only support it if it is named.
A hundred and a half people don't support Clinton.
Perhaps in an unsurprising form, Clinton's existing supporters are especially trying to support him.
There's more confusion between those who don't support Clinton right now -- just by holding on to it.
While it is estimated that 48 percent of Democrats will support Clinton with 48 percent of the population, it is talking about less-favoured representatives of the People's Republic (35 percent).
When open-ended questions were asked about why Clinton's supporters wanted to be named, the first series of statements had real experience (sixth century 16), the idea that a woman now came up with the time of the presidential election (13th century) and the best name for the job (10th century).
Clinton's supporters also claim his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It's just that we can get out of trouble, and we can choose between the criteria we're setting.
As a presidential assistant with potential, 57 percent of democratic voters may want to see him compete, but three-thirds of the group doesn't think so.
When Democrats are asked what the second candidate elections for the party are for, it's up there.
According to Sander, more than half of Clinton's supporters indicated that Biden could have a second choice.
Biden, if he does not enter the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Hillary increases his advantage over Clinton's Sanders; Biden's level of 20 points in a competition where Biden's not in 30 points.
Five-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance of winning a general election, but this number has reached this level since the last century.
And when he looked at it, he was the second one, but the most selective one showed a rise in the percentage of those who saw him as the most select name.
When asked what is the most important thing in a situation, democratic voters are facing the choice of issues.
The past month, no democratic electoral island or adhesion is considered to be no name for these first voters.
In some major characteristics, good performances are provided between democratic or aide figures and the first choice of their own parties.
Most of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest and trustworthy, as well as powerful leadership leaders.
Clinton's leadership is strong when he's the first of three out of the unit's integrity.
According to one hundred and thirty Democrats, Clinton is not honest and reliable, but half of this is the same for Sanders (15th century).
Democrats also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same way as their own ideologies.
All sizes have no idea about Sanders' circle of democratic voters.
While issues relating to the use of personal e-mail and its server continue during the Foreign Office's task, most Democrats are satisfied with the explanation of the issue of democracy and indicate that their views on it are not affected.
But it's a different story in American society.
Only one third of Americans are satisfied when half of them are no longer satisfied with her statements.
The people's meetings were divided in March shortly after the issue was taken under the flag.
Most American e-mails say they don't affect their general meeting on Clinton, and they're in a situation where 36 percent of us don't think about it.
These generally say the community, and 10 people say that their views on Clinton have been distorted by more than six.
Although Clinton is considered to be fair and reliable by its own party voters, it is still a problem among the registered voters as a general problem: only 32% have been honest and reliable since May, and 15 points have fallen since the last month of this number.
The two hundred and six hundred registered voters are not honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country are not honest and reliable.
He also takes good note of Clinton and Trump's leadership.
He took the best points on Biden, Carson and Bush's integrity between the six names involved in the test.
More and more Sanders often find the truth, but most people don't have any idea about him like Carson.
351 The error margin in the samples taken from the democratic elections is 6 points.
I'm in Carson's national polls right behind Donald Trump.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson Donald Trump is running near.
The new poll shows that about half of the voters have won the game and that the others have not had much chance
Community voters in the country's press continue to support Trump in large numbers, with the support of 23% of CBS polls conducted before the conflict took place in Fox News last month.
But Carson's support has risen from 6% to 23% at the same time.
Anket also found that Carson was going well in demographic groups, and his message among Community voters was much higher than that of Trump.
The others, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Valisi John Kasach outside of Wisconsin Valisi Scott Walker's 10th-month-old support for the 10th-month-old.
Former Florida Valisi Jeb Bush, old Arkansas Valisi Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are the third of six.
This latest survey error margin of 376 people selected by Community voters was made on 6 and polled in July.
The last CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson's support among the Community's people was 19% behind the back of Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump in a serious way in front of Carson.
In the past week, Carson, who stood up against the height of his head, continues to put his head in his brain with an apology for having questioned Carson Trump's faith.
"We need energy" said on Saturday at a campaign in Iowa.
Five of the members of Baruch College are charged with the death of their first class student
About two years after the death of a college student in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, he was charged with murder against five people.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi was brutally attacked by Chun "Michael" Deng at the beginning of 2013 and was sentenced to death by the police to take him to the hospital.
The authorities told him that his eyes were closed, that he was wearing a chain bag full of 30 pounds [40 kg] and that he was wearing it all the time as he tried to walk straight in a corner.
Mr. Deng found a complaint indicating that his head had been hurt in time and that he had lost his mind later.
The PI Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 after Deng fell in love with them, and they waited an hour before the police took him to the hospital.
However, according to police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, called their symptoms on Google, and asked for advice on communicating with the national head of the brotherhood, Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner said that at this point the members began to hide personal things and put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't live and lost his next morning's life.
According to one autopsy report, deng, head, neck, and throat have been developed by reproducing strains from non-smokers.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said that many families lost their lives every year since 1970 as a result of the brotherhood.
The brotherhood and members must be responsible for this and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
The major jury of Monroe City recommended that he be charged with murder at the third level for the first five members.
Mr. Meng, in the midst of the thirty-two brothers, will also be charged with the acceptance of the attack and the punishment.
Wagner said at a press conference on Saturday, not only the people involved in the work, but also if there was an organization that confirmed it as official or gay, we'd hold them responsible too.
Baruch College has legalized the brotherhood, and national brotherhood has ended this relationship with the local community.
What happens when Fed increases his fruit juice?
By raising the price prices, the market for wheat is inflated and the economy is in decline, and the economy is in decline.
We know that.
But what we don't know is when all of this will happen and how long it will continue.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about time.
It's been a short period of 11 months after the first phase of recovery, and it's been 86 months.
The increasing aggressiveness of the U.S. Central Bank has been seen in terms of economic and financial assets, although not always.
That's why the U.S. Central Bank has been strongly attacked, not by the time investors started to increase their rates, but by the emphasis on how much the normalization process will take.
It's a fact that there are different changes.
But as a matter of fact, the marketers may think that the tax rate has been reduced.
In a note to global economist Julian Jessop told customers, "It is still impossible to translate this global financial crisis as a sign of the end of the 'low money' period by some of the first increase by Fed."
Instead, we don't expect U.S. fruit crops to return slowly to normal, but we see that most still low levels are fear of drought.
We can't say they won't.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy can give:
As seen in the past few months on the market, waiting for more fruit fields to increase may slow some things down for a period of time.
The effect will not be so marked when Faiz is increased.
In a new study on what will happen after the increase in feds, Deutsche Bank analysts say, "Seeing that 12 to 24 months after the first increase in personal imports, this may also undermine the stability of the monetary policy."
According to a daily analysis shared by the Nuveen Property Administration analyst Bob Doll in Barron's, the market has generally recorded cut-outs over the last 35 years, and it's going on to a straight line after 14 rounds of 250 days (average 2.6 percent) and 500 days later, it's usually returned to the last six times.
Deutsche said that the effect on emotions was more marked by the decline in fruit and vegetables in the next few years.
Retirement is a fact of economic life, but it also helps them with income increases.
Fred, in a state of journalism, is facing some situations that are not yet available and that will speed up his recovery.
What's more important is that the pure-bred gorilla is at the lowest level up to this day for Fed's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase of 118 percent since 1950, in nominal year, dropped by only two percent to 4.5 percent below.
As far as the second round of 2015, although it took place at 3.6 level, Atlanta Fed says that this situation is expected to remain very low and it looks at 1.5 per cent in the third round.
According to Deutsche, it may be dangerous to increase the incomes in such an economic environment, and it could lead to the question "will be different" this time.
A year ago, the attention of the market participants waiting for Fed's increase of income was paid on this week at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee which will end on Friday.
While most strategic experts believe that economicist FOMC can approve an increase in this meeting, the average market is only 25 percent.
The report states: "In the research we've been doing since 1950, all of the cycles of growth that have taken place until today are within a super-high-level training cycle and are reaching speeds before the start of the collection,"
Rather, it was a gathering in an unprecedented state of lethargy.
The latest turn is the longest turn since Fed's last return -- the longest turn in the record was 35 months, and the turn we've been in is still in the 74th month.
It's hard to wait for more fruit in the market, but it's unusual, and it looks like it's a good deal of property.
In fact, when Fed's policy changes its progress, it's not as fast as it feels like it's in the clouds.
When the first increase/warming occurs, it does not change the way the vessels are brought.
At the end of their return of interest, it is time for them to make contributions," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab's strategy scientists, the increases in the rate will bring the gap between longer and shorter periods of time closer.
We're in the analysis of high-performance tankers who say that they usually have better performances in a environment like this, Kathy Jones said, but "we're careful about reaching out."
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets are now in line with Fed's political expectations.
He wrote: "There are various signs that, in addition to the decline in dollar power and inflation expectations, the market has been organized according to its most frequent monetary policy."
Short-term interest rates increase, data flow has increased correctly, credit spreads and inflation has increased - all the features that will be seen on the market when the FED policy is tightened.
In view of the broad scope, companies that do most of the work in the United States will gain more and more income and local products will be more efficient.
The situation of many international companies that are heavily indebted will get worse, make more dollars more expensive on the world market, and pay more.
Goldman Sachs said in a report that analysts prepared for customers, "History shows that the "Qatheli" sense years can lead to a loss of performance at the beginning of such an increase."
Companies with strong imbalances have gone through 5 percent of those with poor balance between 1994, 1999 and 2004.
And companies with low-performance and low-performance feelings passed low-quality accounts (by 4%) by 3 (by 3%).
The force will become a big issue.
According to Goldman, high-ranking companies are able to see the most damaging.
In addition to the pure bus game, it's expected that the dealers will benefit from extra dollars.
Although scientists have different meetings on how fast they can hold, designers can get out of high-performance gains.
Andrew Bingham said a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
An interviewer named Andrew Bingham's station "dear away"
He's been warned that the radio has become so different from the commercials that it's gone.
In addition, BBC showed music awards and accused him of throwing British Awards in short.
Her lawyer's friend Damien Collins is guilty of not releasing The Voice
The next official, on the way to BBC Radio 3, told Classic FM that he had "turned" to the publisher to place the difference between other commercial stations.
The interviewer, Andrew Bingham, told the BBC boss that the radio channel, which served as a public service to the BBC bosses, was "indistinct" and was different from the commercial figures on the way.
He said, "I don't like using this tool, but Radio 3 "has gone off," he's going back to Classic FM."
And that's what we've been doing for the first time in the range of BBC Music Awards.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year are another version of the British Awards.
Bingham said, "If you're going to do something very different, these are the first two examples that come to my mind, so you hold and copy what's on the market."
The BBC general manager said that if the BBC Radio 3 needed live music, it was clear from the commercial figures in public education.
If I learn from Radio 3, I can't go and learn something about classical music anywhere else.
And it's a connection to live music and music can't be compared to anything else.
He also said that Radio 3's new music discovery and work are important to me.
BBC Radio 3, manager Alan Davey, said that in order to get more listeners to his kitten this year, the radio had to work more on the past, because he said the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3, Culture, Media and Sport Elections Committee was not the only unit that was grouped because of the fact that BBC won the turnout.
National representative Tory Damien Collins de Ses, the BBC company in the Netherlands, sold 22 million steroids from Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the program brought so much noise because it's not free and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall, Paloma Faith, and Boy George's tour of BBC1 Show, he stressed that "a special challenge to BBC" was made.
He said he wanted to "find a hit out of his own blood" before he had another fun program.
What is more, he did not accept the idea that in the future he would no longer stop the production of the sound program or that he would spend it on other formats.
Is Kara Cuma the reason why Internet sales are making the most of their history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in Internet sales in the first three months of 2015
This is still the smallest increase since the year 2000, when the last month's records began to break.
Three years ago, when mobile devices began to be used for sale, there was a explosion on the Internet.
The experts point out why Kara Cuma's expenses could be cut in June
Buying from the Internet has been a long time since the end of the decade and has turned England's most lively shopping habits into a ghost town.
In the first three months of 2015, researchers indicated that there was only one percent increase in Internet sales in 2015 and that there was more weaknesses in Internet sales.
In August last year, a total of five percent increase was recorded, and this was the lowest increase since the year 2000.
In the first three months of 2015, scientists indicate that there is only one percent increase in Internet sales in 2015 and that there are more signs of weakness in Internet sales
In his statement to the Guardian, IRRG sales editor Andy Mulcahy said, "If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially the 2000s, you will see that everything is actually going back to normal within time."
He added that three years ago, Internet sales began using mobile phones to buy products.
This meant that even more people could buy while they were sitting on a chair.
But now he's going to bed, you can see the growth.
Kara Cuma, a cave taken from America, is shown as one of the reasons why sales slow down.
Scholars suggest that in order to buy something from the villagers, it may be expected that this activity that took place on the last day of the month of August may be expected.
In the last year's activity, more than five times as many companies have been attacked by websites of companies in order to obtain more than one year's cash flow.
Experts suggest that Kara Cuman's buyers who show that the buyers fought for download could be listed as "current"
The English Perakeners pointed out that each of the 5 steroids that spent on the purchase of a research published by the Union spent 1 steroids on the Internet for the purpose of selling products.
Like a TV and a washing machine, some of the products are now sold from their online stores.
He also buys more than one in four people's clothes and shoes instead of luxury and show-case shopping.
Because bin Ladin's family was found guilty, the Muslims who lost their lives in a war accident in Mecca have succeeded in their final journey
After the first funeral in Mekke, 29 people who lost their lives were moved to the streets by Muslims.
Suudi Binladin was responsible for the construction of the Suudi Binladin group as a responsibility for the debt crisis in Saudi Arabia
The health review revealed that 394 people were injured after the fall of vincin.
Hundreds of Muslims have come to a meeting to move the 29 people who have lost their lives by falling into the arm of a vincin.
The majority of white people, the first cemeteries in Mexico, have lost their way to the final journey to the Museum of the Muaysim.
Several days ago, a vindictive vine passed through the sacred place where a fiance was placed on its roots.
At the same time, 394 injuries were caused after the owner of the building site of the Kingdom of Sweden charged Binladin with the death penalty.
A vincin was transported on the way to the graveyards of the 29 who lost their lives by falling down on Mescid.
When he won among the dead, he had four children from the Bolton region of Manchester, which was the first race to win.
Mr. Akram, at the beginning of his annual worship of Haqq, he and his parents came to Sharam.
The Swedish leaders announced that Haccun will continue to participate in thousands of haqqs on his way to Mecca.
In his statement today, King Salman, the Binladin Holding Group, stated that he should not leave his hand of wine open without my use.
In Arabic version, the farm, which was operated by the State, stated that the Swedish Press Agency was prepared to be the only party to be charged with the case.
The news agent's English service did not pass the details, but it indicated that the company's authorities had been given the right to leave.
At the beginning of the week, Salman, Vinicin, swore to find out why hundreds of thousands of Muslims came to Haqzai at the end of the month to return to the village of Meshid.
There was no explanation of the Billing Group's debt and no permission to interfere with its representatives.
He accused the Kingdom of not taking any steps to modern security and not cooperating with the meteorology authorities.
The plans of Mescid Horam, located in Mekke, have turned into wine, which is largely under the leadership of the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been in close contact with Suudi Arabia's management family for years, and most of it is the name of the construction project.
Al-Qaide's last senior leader, Osama Bin Ladin, was a son of a bitch who made me from my childhood.
In a period of drought, violent wind and rain, every adult Muslim in his life was at least once eager to visit the Haqq village, just a few days before millions died.
The authorities reported that 158 people were still treated in the hospital.
The authorities have provided 1 million Riyal (174,000 sterilins) to families of the dead and to survivors of a long life.
The other wounded will take half of this.
The B&Q pattern says that the North European artists who work at the back of this trend
Veronique Lauri says the British have hired more teachers.
As a result of this increase, the number of Western European customs specialists is falling asleep
At the end of this, 200 new Screwfix store is open
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q sales points in the country
As told by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Speaker
It is said that the British have begun to employ skilled European specialists to do their jobs instead of leaving behind their trailers and paints.
If you're wearing a pair of shoes or shoes on a wall, it means you're too low in these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are running more and more cars to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Lauri, the new director general of Kingfisher's house repair prison, said that there was a large increase in the number of Western European wealthy businessmen who offered low-cost services after this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more 200 new Screwfix store to customers by closing the 60 B&Q sale point.
Ms. Laurie B&Q wanted more women to be employed at the B&Q stores because she said that she was given eight by women because of the ten purchases in the store.
Most of the staff are now men.
He said that a woman who has done more to improve the house than she did in the past needed to deal with the growing demographic trends seen in her house.
Mrs. Lauri said to them: "There's still a lot of men working in our shops.
We need to get more water.
Mostly, half of our customers are women and the products they sell, 80 percent are made by women.
Women play a big part in making decisions.
The companies that came up in Britain, one of the five women who were at the beginning of FTSE100, also restructured the top team to become the same number of men and women as managers.
Kingfisher, general manager and financial manager, including 50 percent of the team's staff, is almost the only one.
Ms. Lauri said to them: "This was a conscious decision -- diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find the good women who would take care of our administration.
After loading the property of stores owned by the group, Kingfisher heard that there was a decline in sales and sales in less than six months.
At the end of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screawfix and B&Q, will open 200 new store.
Time of decision for the U.S. Central Bank for the FED
The United States Central Bank monitors the two-day meetings that continue on Wednesday and Thursday; the decision is expected to be made ten years later to avoid increasing the gap.
Now they think that the FED will apply this decision a week more than half of the 80 economists' poll by Reuters, and they think they're going to take this decision between 0 and 0.25.
This is a case of a case of seven years ago since the FED sent down its assets to zero.
A leading researcher from the Peterson International Economic Institute said "The first time we'll be witness that a large central bank has begun to normalise its financial positions."
According to the U.S. economy, it adds billions of dollars to the balance and creates less inflation during good performance planning and reorganization of the economy.
But the FED can't look at the world table, which is less promising.
He warned of an increase in prices, but there are some who believe that this situation will not allow for such an increase.
The decision will be made on Friday at 8:00 p.m.
He left an apology file for the murder at Delta State University
According to the authorities on Saturday morning, Shannon Lamb left a note saying that he was "good" for the first murder and "if I can get back" after killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Friday morning and at the same time before killing his Christian friend.
The Mississippi Gautier police call 911 in the 10 a.m. of the Lamb, who studied geography and social sciences at the Delta State University.
He said he said he was shot by a gun and killed someone.
Lamb said he should send the police to the phone.
Lamb, who said, "I killed my wife last night," also said that there was "a cute dog that didn't hurt anybody" at home and that he was probably sad.
If the police asked her name, she didn't tell her name.
There was no explanation of the Lamb's murder.
When the police took the scene, 41-year-old Amy Prentiss met with a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm sorry I could take back my spare time.
I loved Amy very much, and she was the only person I've ever loved.
Lamb, after writing this note, went to Delta Island 300 miles away and killed Professor Ethan Schmidt, and then the police rushed on him.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that he didn't know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but he said, "There are some things in Lamb's mind."
On Tuesday, Lamb, despite reports that his girlfriend Prentiss believed he had a sensitive relationship with Schmidt, indicated that the authorities had not found "no information or evidence" in his hand on Sunday that he was a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for about seven years, is known as Prentiss as "good man".
He got divorced 15 years ago, but he had friends.
O'Steen said that a 19-year-old girl was found with Prentis and that she was "in a state of weakness."
O'Steen also indicated that her daughter and Prentiss were "of course her best friend."
According to Sun Herald, he was working on the press from Prince's house on the Internet, according to Lindsday Knowledge, which he was known as a close friend of Parentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owns a dog by the name of Lightning, was with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "He always loved helping others."
The police said, "I'm not going to go to jail" by calling the police Lamb's Thursday.
The same night, the police near Greenville at Highway 1 approached him well near Lamb, flew into the woods, and shot himself with a gun.
According to CV published on the University's website, Lamb was awarded a doctoral degree at the Delta State University in early 2015.
The stars that lost their former value
His son Redmond (right) was a very stressful actor for several years.
In 2001, he fought with a solution, and in 2009, his friend Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor who said he was fighting drugs also stopped finding drugs in 2008.
All of this certainly hurt him.
From Manchester United, Luke Shaw has been breaking up for two months.
Luke Shaw's right leg, Manchester United Champions League, suffered two strokes in the game that was transferred to PSV Eindhoven.
When this event, which put his defense player in their eyes, will leave him at least six months away from the fields, Louis van Gaal Shaw is hoping that this season will be able to return to the stage again.
Unfortunately, at the age of 20, Shaw's game was about 15 minutes away from Hector Moreno.
He was treated at the hospital for nine minutes and then had to be given oxygen before he fell in love with the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "I'm in two places, and I'm in the hospital right now."
Today or someday maybe he'll be in love and be taken to an operation in Manchester.
A bad situation is an 18-year-old young man who moved to Manchester, first spends hard times, then plays a great game and then comes to this.
There was an oxygen mask in my bedroom.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you break out of two places, it means at least six months and it means you can't play around the group.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno was lucky to save the ring when he threw the red card and the pen.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexico.
Van Gaal of Italy indicated that his authority had made a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a panel and a red card.
He was a very bad fighter for two of his cousins.
The tweet on Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your messages. I don't have enough words to tell you how much I'm feeling. I'm starting to get better now, and I'm going to get stronger."
Interestingly: Luke Shaw lives on the corner of the clock at the Manchester United PSV news
It's gonna be moral for the League English defence player to be organized in Tammuz, France.
PSV Technical Director Phillip Cocu said, "It's a very bad move."
If such a move comes to the head of any player, everyone will regret it.
It's not our players' intention to make their appearance.
Moreno, 2014 in the World Cup, was also killed while playing in the Mexican team against Van Gaal in the Netherlands.
Cocu, it's very difficult because it's never meant to be a rival, and it wasn't good after she heard it was a very bad break, he said.
I couldn't see that memory in my mouth.
The only thing I could see was a bunch of different directions, like Moreno touched him, but I didn't see Luke stealing.
"I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel so bad about it, and I'm so sorry.
From PSV, Andrés Guardado was taken to the final hospital for fighting with Chris Smalling.
Of course David Cameron The Lorax knows better than that?
This is what every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know that it will not take more than a little time to learn it.
Looks like if you're not David Cameron.
When asked what was the most popular child book by a tattoo programmer in charge of child care, Dr. Seuss chose The Lorax, a 1971 environmental issue.
Cameron, who writes that this is a difficult decision on the SuperCamps website, continues: "I like to read this book, which is a funny, moving, creative and powerful message, because it always includes an image or message we always read."
Everything was going so well here, so much so that Cameron wrote something about the contents of the book of poetry, but in fact, the book added new characters and details to cover the content of the original text, until it was changed by the film version by 2012.
He writes that the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, is a child named Ted in Thneed-Ville who wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree to reach Audrey's heart.
If you're not sure enough, it's very similar to a short text from the Internet Film Archive, which Cameron received: "The Lora film begins with a very simple text: "The city of Thneed-Ville wants to win the heart of Audrey, a girl in a child's imagination, named Ted."
In view of all the ideas that work is a mystery, it is unlikely that Cameron, who heard of the destruction of the mother book of the book of Lorax by a young man named Lorax, who is known as the local environment, is not aware of how it was destroyed by the poor and "those who speak on behalf of the trees" who cut down the trees.
It's probably like this weak-minded nation's job is compared to an order servant who's not read The Lorax more than 20 times for a child.
One of the president's speakers said that the text was thought of as coming from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps recommended that the text be provided by Cameron's staff, but there was no way out.
Adam Lyth was at risk of leaving England in public, but I still can't.
It's a difficult task to play with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but after seeing the English team selected for the tour, I don't think there's one of the three-0-year-old test series updates that happened last time.
I still don't give up the possibility of a demolition.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good players on the battle line and a collective understanding of the game, which does not improve the wounds of 2012 but provides only a little youth-based well-being.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali develops as a player and represents an attack option even if Justice Rashid does not know the quality of the test.
Interestingly: Adam left Lyth England Research team and was replaced by Alex Halles
Adam Lyth's decision to take out, it's a difficult decision to be analysed for me as a major trainer in Yorkshire.
The Seven Tests were against two good fathers in tough times, and the simple but inevitable fact is that critics are judged as a result.
For example, there was no sign of any question about Joe Root, and there was no way to hear it because -- as I said earlier -- players were their best choices.
After a couple of years of counting, Lyth could see his career was gone, but he identified his career.
I hope he'll get another chance if he works more for Yorkshire.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss, although he didn't show the best performance, did not surprise me; first of all, he was a team man.
It's hard to tell how much it's going to take notice of a test shooter.
Lyth -- like Sam Robson before him -- took seven cups, Nick Compton got nine more.
Compton's only got the chance of an exciting game.
The only way you can feel like Jonathan Trott would be to go to Karayeppele for the first time - while Lyth's form is on the horizon - but this empty opportunity has been in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level shooter.
A cricket at the X-factor's birth, and this, at the start of this season, when Trent Bridge made 236 numbers against us, we saw it in Yorkshire.
At least he should be able to take the same opportunity as he had before, but this is, of course, about the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen made an idea of making an open fight with Cook so that the player could get more than four quicks, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why an shooter can't shoot here, but it showed how good this left-hand man is as a cricket.
Moen, he couldn't do his job for Worcestershire, but he saw 3 numbers for them and there's no difference.
My old team friend Justin Langer played first before he started his first 38th exam in 2001.
He caught three hundred's series right away and didn't look behind him.
The Zafar Ansari team comes as a player of the seven and surprised me as an active young man in my limited encounters with myself.
People can also see their statistics -- 31 averages in war and 35 averages in total -- and they may think it's a draw, but there's not many players who remove their hands, and the player's choices are made even since they're young.
He'll learn a lot about this kind of thing.
It looks like he's made a couple of sets of sets for his team of coaches in England, far from Egypt.
Siri Lanka's shooter Mahela Jaywardene may be a major step forward to be assigned to speak for the Test Games.
He's one of the most favorite people in the game. He's gonna bring me a full experience against all the bullets.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball foot and both energy and the game's winning a series of games without pain.
I've always thought he was born for the world of cricket, and there's an understanding that can be found to guide like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the soybean room, even if the previous messages are delivered, can bring a new one to my team.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes is listening to a daily game, and he's given Root a medal like that against Australia, and I don't have a problem with it.
Not everyone's done with the same idea, with plans, coaches and players.
And don't forget that they're just like players. They're connected to the results.
Such decisions are not always easy.
Brexit camp can be won while the economy is stable until 2017
David Cameron's half-year-old dialogue strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this situation is "Yes?" Despite Corby's election to the leadership of Corbyn's Party or the fact that the TUC's Saturday is out of business in Europe.
The aliens also have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
In the past, a friend of European diplomats, some Member States, in the EU, who did not want to do so, stated that the changes in trade facilitation agreements had been cut off from the day that Britain had just thought of itself.
The TUC decided he didn't want to do this while harming social security during the annual meeting in Brighton.
We can even call this Dave and George's own day.
The president and Chancellor of foreign countries are taking their own pictures, whether they attend assemblies or bilateral meetings, regardless of the famous events in which they come forward, and then they return to their countries and say that they have gathered for reform.
It's all about me.
When Berlin said "Don't leave us alone with France," my European friend who wanted to come back to Britain in the EU's Chamber said that some of the presidents had come to a point where they no longer wanted us to stay.
The chance of Germany's potential and smart beginnings is that Angela Merkel has been a coward for 10 years and wants to break away from the power of not going wrong, as in the example of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland, France, with a re-election or a change of power in 2017.
He's a left-handed power.
Soon a national government from the right in Poland will come to power from the left in Spain.
It's not likely that these countries will show up for the British that they need to use to prevent Iceland's energy from being separated from the United Kingdom because they don't want it either, because most of them have different trainers.
So some of these observers, in the Icelandic National Party, may be planning to speed up the Brexit process during the 2017 United Kingdom campaign, while my friend says this.
"There wasn't a conversation again" and "British didn't get anything to benefit from the discussion again."
Europeans know how much Fleet Street's salesman, how much the U.S. pressure barons were from the time of Tony Benn, and they were inspired by a reference to 1975, which allowed us to enter into the first place in 1973.
In the early 1990s, the Brussels ambassador named Boris Johnson, who heard the name "the EU's fairies", was reminded of this.
Once again, Ed Miliband knew who the enemies were.
Among them were tax collectors, non-governmental telephone people, and many of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was thinking a lot of the same things about them, and he realized that he had to share his attention while he was sitting in a low-carbon coffee shop while he was eating his breakfast and after the hour of the water.
In fact, Miliband, a prominent reference to Cameroon, also quoted Blair from Blair, and Blair, who was quoted by French and Dutch voters who gave him a certificate of entry in 2005 on the principle of EU motherhood.
The press never forgave him for this.
But on Wednesday, I told him you're not going to lose me anymore - Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, and then it looks like Murdoch's 80-year-old boycott strategy is under my threat again.
It's gonna take time, but it's not with me, but with the media, it's gonna take Andrew Marr to develop a sustainable strategy to be in touch with the BBC on Friday.
I'm expressing Corby's official position in Europe as a major development.
He says he wants us to stay in an EU after reform.
Most of the people who stayed outside the enemy's village of Okip and the fire supporters of the Little English Museum say yes.
In fact, Hilary Benn, who's not Bennite, said this week on radio and television, forced himself to admit that Corby's father was a bad idea as a monster.
It reminded me in the 70s of his father's work on the TV of his friends in his office of employment, that he would not go any further, and that he would lose his job in the office.
Hilary's fight was more exciting.
But it was the same thing that McDonnell said at a special meeting with the Lord's people on the night of the JC's Friday night.
In view of what he has touched me, Corbyn continues to take care of the discipline of the social media, which he is trying to convey, regardless of how it is popular, at the time of 7/24 TV and at a well-known paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, when I referred to Cameron, it's a matter of making it difficult to get back to Europe to secure the support of the Labour Party.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But it's no longer a particular dispute between the left-wing leaders of the teaching of the small diversity of narratives that the Bennite economy and anti-capitalist history of EU membership of McDonnell and Corbyn are no longer in line with the transitions between the Bennite economy and the anti-capitalist past.
As in the transfer of Nato, Tom Watson is determined not to campaign for distribution by the JC -- foreign diplomats will have to challenge the masters of foreign countries to get out of this.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political power when they have their own suspects?
As I was told at the opening of the United Kingdom Security Forum on Friday, the United States, despite the government of the present-day low-income Republican Party, is already experiencing a resounding disappointment from the weak military performance of the British forces in Iraq, Libya and Syria.
Experts are doing an e-insurance investigation into the English Kamu Health
At a meeting of 12 persons in a meeting of 12 persons with a government-funded agency, the researchers indicated that e-insurances were less harmful than smoking.
Scientists who wrote in the British Press (BMJ) participated in Lancet's e-insurance report on the English Kamu Health (PHE).
PHE published his report last month on the "second point" that was identified as a "deller approach in a specific format".
But some researchers have questioned the health of the data and have taken into account the connections between scientists and the entire industry.
The last month of Lancet's story, PHE's mother-in-law, was targeted by "the primary drop-down level" on the ground.
Two other researchers in BMJ were asked whether the ideas "were built either on the tire or on the stone."
Professor of Public Health at London Hygyen and Tropical School of Europe, Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, Simon Capewell, said: "The activity of basic primary health policies is a crazy one."
They said that PHE's "increased cost of e-insomnia is about 95 percent less harmful than e-insomnia" is expected to stop the evidence and modelling of a detailed insemination.
In fact, it is from a 12-person meeting gathered to develop a very critical decision-making analysis (MCDA) to create a synthesis of the meetings on the harmful effects of this nicotine; the results of the meeting are described in a study article.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously received funds from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
They also said in a possible case report that BAT approved the public health certificate.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported that one of them had received money from an e-insurance producer, but they added that it had not been reported from Philip Morris International.
There was no information on how the panel members were selected, but some of these included known countries of e-sigrament that reported the industry's fund in the article.
Some others who are present at the meeting are not known for their full control skills.
The meeting was attended by someone responsible for PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the research article written by the group "in an intellectual way" acknowledged that "the fact that most of the victims are likely to have serious evidence of injury" is a fact.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that "there's no evidence that the e-insurance of smoking is too early for children or people who don't smoke."
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and rest at PHE, said that the ideas at BMJ had been answered before.
He said, "E-Sugars are less harmful to smoking than smoking."
One of the two people who've been smoking for a lifetime is dying from this addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks of e-signatures are relatively small, but we need to keep track of their long-term effects.
PHE has the right role: to be informed about what the evidence shows and what it doesn't.
Almost 80,000 people die of a smoking-related disease each year, and smoking costs NHS $2 billion a year.
While there are available evidence -- even if e-insurance is not safe -- that the use of tobacco causes only a small fraction of the damage -- we carry out our national responsibility in a clear way.
The former Chief of Channel 4 said the BBC should leave EastEnders.
Former Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop publishing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that advertising agents could "give their right hands" for hot programs such as Albert Square's lines.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to program types not made by other English publishers.
He made BBC because he placed public service programmes, which are likely to be monitored by a smaller monitoring group, against the most retreading programmes in the ranges, to be placed on channels such as BBC4.
After telling BBC Director General Tony Hall that the organization wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said it had been a failure in Channel 4 to establish a connection with BBC.
Johnson told the Board of Lords communication committee during a question about the BBC's coming, "I am fighting against the idea of providing and publishing programmes that can be presented by BBC without obvious subsidies."
If you're running a license fee that I'm not sure is a good idea in the middle or in the long run, you need to download at least one of the programs that others have not done or have not prepared.
The voice is published in the spring because they want to provide a wide range of support as soon as possible.
The main idea here is that no one else can publish it because it's a joke and a clear joke.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why programs that can't be funded without help should be financed by a tax that is ineffective.
The voice is one of the EastEnders, and it's actually done in another company.
If you have to be honest, other channels will give you their right hands for this.
I'm trying to see how the public service is spreading.
I don't think that's gonna bother BBC.
Johnson, a series manager of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of running "because it is the best way to ensure long-term support for this approach and the people working here."
BBC's comments on the most popular programs are repeated by former Sky Director Tony Ball who used the MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer BBC's programs like EastEnders.
Johnson BBC said that the more appropriate public service programmes were going to BBC4 and that the monitor size would not be made here, but that they were taxable and that they would be able to continue their religious duties to provide the land with 4 billion steroids on the basis of the license fee, and he added, "We are doing all these waste programmes that no one has ever watched."
They put them in empty spaces that no one will ever watch.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system than that of those who benefit from it.
Of course, you're all thinking, we're all thinking, 150 steroids a big price a year, but I'm wondering why 150 steroids don't have a lot of BBC surveillance for people with a lot of money.
At the same time on Saturday, former head of Sky and Channel 5 to the Committee, David Elstein, said that he should revise Reithian's mission to "advise, educate and fun" BBC.
The BBC said that some of the outputs were now classified as formal education - it said that the TV output was %1 and the radio was %0.1 - and that the public service publications in Australia and Canada should be ahead of it and that it should be changed as "information, explanation and training".
With regard to the partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC only had to do something about the Proms shown on TV, and to ensure that the whole translation was monitored.
Sonogenetics enables brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how they changed their direction when they were shot by the sound waves.
Scientists have developed neurons with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
They change direction when people don't hear the mini-implicity curves when they're hit by sound titrations.
The titrations are operated using genetically modified motor cell circuits to transmit wave signals.
Careful: Researchers are reading the brain’s activity in a clear light
Researchers said that insects have demonstrated the power of a new process called Sonogenetic; so ultrasound can be used to activate the brain, heart and bone cells outside the body.
Sreekant Chalasani Guardian, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian that one day this process will take place as a process that gives people electrical titrations in their brains to cure Parkinson's symptoms.
They don't usually react to noise, but Chalasani found that they reacted when they were surrounded by a fluid that contained microscopic particles.
He's been found by the bells. He's strengthening the bells, so he's making them pass through the cockpits.
The increased volume of waves affects structures called TRP-4 ion channels that are located in some of the nerve cells.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves enable these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
In order to create video clips controlled by the audio transmission, Chalasani has genetically changed its curves in order to ensure the transmission of TRP-4 ion channels by some motor neurons.
When applied to modified creatures, sound waves were powered by micro-circuits and flowed into the corsets and operate modified motor neurons here as well.
This is the process, in which scientists find comparisons with optogenetics, an external open-ended instrument that enables people to operate and close their neurons with light titrations.
But Chalasani says there may be some advantages in this technique.
Instead of the light to be transmitted to the point in the brain by an optical lift, low-frequency sound waves can pass through the brain safely and so they can be sent into the brain over its head.
Chalasani said, "We believe that the human nervous system that is intended for certain neurological treatments can be transmitted in the clinical context by means of a gene therapy and treatment virus," he said.
It also added that other applications may be able to access bone cells and human-heart cells.
You're wearing your extraordinarily painful crew-- the full door!
Advertising corrupts England's arms trade
Watch the international Afgügütt 's weapons race video.
They're terrible killer drones!
Pants that break your leg!
It's a piece of fucking bomb!
And it's because of the violent pain but it's electric shockheads that don't let go!
The international Af of Interest, an insecurities and cartoons prepared to attack the international arms trade by means of the International Defence and Security Team at the London ExCel Centre of the Government of England, no doubt about the fact that the world's largest arms race is a short counterfeit.
Interestingly: DSEI gunfire: authoritarian regimes attack London
But a different campaign continues with buses and posters on the subway trains and needs to look twice.
Turning to the DLR line, using London Metrosu's fonts and trademark, he says, "Are you going to travel to DLR between 15 and 18 September?"
This July, a crowd of gun vendors will attack the DLR... wants to help customers stop this gunfire.
300 posters from the artists who hosted the Museum of Violence in Dismaland, Bangkok.
A private Divriye Group, which is named after the group, has a 6-pound collective and has been used to distribute "Adverts Packages" to around three areas of advertising on the planet.
I didn't like the "Vandalism" exchange for London.
One of the commercials was created by the Special Divri group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, a member of the University of Essex, who is a professor of violent design, artists are becoming more and more curious every day and are looking for ways to transport political works to the streets outside the streets.
Many artists are acting with activists in protest movements, and they are starting to realize that they need to go to the real world to have an impact on the community.
Another gun race against posters goes against those who travel on the subway.
The International Afgügütt’s video was watched by more than 100,000 people on Facebook within 24 hours and was created by a free-of-charge VCCP advertising agency and produced free-of-charge audio by the graphic designer.
The VCCP Creator Manager Matt Lever was so surprised by the silence of the gunmen's commercials - with the exCele calendar empty - and he thought, "Let's start a campaign that they're trying to escape."
They're more real, they've been playing with the idea of making a formal commercial, but "they've been hit by bright colors and animations, they've become more exciting."
Tom Davies from Af Yörgütt said: "They have been very helpful in creating concerns about the sale of non-legislative pain equipment in the field."
Now we need the Government of England to prevent the sale of pain equipment illegally before our door.
Maybe it comes from ExCeL inside the most creative plant in the gunhouse, where the organizers are selling fantastically-advertising products.
In a press release, Saab pointed out that the U.S. Army's "AT4CS RS launched from us".
It contains "the chapter of war that hits a great deal through an unevenly formal and objective circle."
Whatever he's doing, that's not gonna be nice.
8 Golden Rule for Living in Students
It's been 11 years since I was a 19-year-old, and I still believe in morality and morality, but now I remember the many long-term complaints about what I've been doing.
Most of what I've learned can be applied as eight gold rule.
Moving down here can be seen from a serious disorder to a complete degree.
The origin of the lead: where people are, where they don't lose their year, where they stick to Corbyn, and why you don't like and hate open Marmite, because the real gentlemen are just gonna be on the May I'm gonna be in the room."
Take a breath.
And let the others take another one - problem and show you the side.
It will direct this conversation, and if your brains are full and they are tired, it will help you to separate what you like from the people you don't talk about.
Leave people alone for a while.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, movie theaters at night, and mass dances, but here they are where people are dressed and they set up their own bathrooms.
Interestingly: Don't even think about starting a relationship with a university
They're going to see bad guys at the university.
Your room may be a nursing home, but it develops a culture of dress between many local corridors, and it reveals to friends the life, the social and the life of a friend.
Hell could be for someone who works for this energy storage.
Nothing in the culture lets you say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little bit so I can replace the energy I spend with you when I get in touch with you."
Try to tell your friend that you're tired of socializing and maybe texting instead of playing the door.
When he says to steal the door, do it.
A friend at the student's place, if the door wasn't locked, he would have made a policy like he's invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't be friends with meds.
Since you've begun to go to university in the fields of food madness, it's less weird to meet people's doors with a cigarette brownie and less than 1950s, "You're welcome to our meal, I've got something for you, now I'm going to laugh when you ask personal questions."
It's a great way to make friends with people who make house-building programs.
Perhaps they feel compelled to talk to your friends about your face with a lovely surprise.
It's obviously about being a superhero.
An uncomplicated crowd will be a mess of heat, sugar, and rain that will cause people to sleep when you knock out the door.
It's a crime that's been found in the places where they're going to play.
Sniffing someone's dog is obvious, but do you want to take a couple of bottles of milk for your tea?
Check the mouse pointer twice.
He'll tell you to look after his own head even if he's in a big accident.
It's a lot of trouble for someone to steal things, and I understand you, but try to make it happen more like a friend of mine.
She's in jail now.
Don't get involved in people's sleep or training.
It's not just being a good person, but because you're the ones who are in the house.
A girl in my neighborhood said to a neighbor on the side of my desk and some of their bills because it was three o'clock in the night and she was testing herself in the morning.
The answer was further opened.
Finally, when they closed at 5:00 a.m., she finally opened her own music and closed the door and allowed them to follow for two hours at a time before they went to their own three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be very romantic for your future wife to move you to the same corridor?
On the other hand, would it not be very strange to think that you have to be alone, separated, and see your partner every day and watch your partner be arrested?
Of course, that's right, but if your neighbor's fire corridor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to him and give him advice.
When you realize that someone has left your keys behind to lock the door, know that it's more than you think the line between the act and the act is wrong.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can give someone a valuable and fun lesson about security by keeping your stuff up, but don't interfere with someone's room with your teeth.
Lock their doors and lock their keys in a bucket of water, but don't touch your stuff twice as much as you can.
The head of the meclist that moved to the Netherlands
At the fourth stage of the election held yesterday at Meclist, Arib, who played the highest number of plays, became the first leading meclist in the Netherlands.
This task will also be carried out by Arib until 2017.

The last offer came from Eskišehirspor to the hope Bult, who was not in line with G.Saray's side of the star and who was in the final match due to the moral corruption of the tribes.
He lost this position. He wanted to get out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer, he also made his last name for the international golf club that Kasimpasha wanted to join.
But to the red people, we were answered by G.Sarai's administration.
She stopped her heart while she was getting better
Raquel Santos (28), a mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, followed an aesthetic doctor to remove the traces from her teeth on the last day of the market.
After a while, she had an injection in her face, she had a heart attack and a breath.
Then his heart's stop has lost his last life.
The police are investigating whether a woman's "Potenay" drug, which is used daily, has a role to play in the death of her.
The real cause of death will be found after the autopsy.
In his statement to the Brazilian press, one of his closest friends, Deborah Azevedo, said that Santos, who had two sons at the age of seven and 13 years of age, had been involved in aesthetic surgery.
Santos, who participated in Brazil's most important beauty contests during the mid-month of the month of Moses do Brazil.
Petroleum companies dropped image
From 2014, when the oil prices began to drop, the most deep sea (deepwater) oil call projects were launched by the end of the last year.
According to the business company Wood Mackenzie's research, while low oil prices, oil and gas call/resources project costing $380 billion were charged to Africa from the Gulf of Mexico, and the production of electricity in a large plot has been transferred to Africa for millions of dollars.
In 2014, for the largest reason, the capital gains were recorded at $115 in 2014 at a level of 1.5 per cent and 70 per cent of the oil prices dropped to the lowest level of 12 years.
$400 million in cash
And every day, when we made new surprises, the oil prices went down to 30 dollars, looking at the lowest level of the 12 years we've been through.
"Do oil fall to $15"; "Do oil now fly out of water" is a study published by Wood Mackenzie's Energy Talk Company in the days when the competitions are slowed down by the oil industry, and it highlights how the sector is affected by falling prices.
In a recent report published in Tammuz, the number of oil prices that fell from 200 billion dollars is revealed by the average cost of 46 major energy investments, led by Wood Mackenzie, which has reached the target by 2015 in his new research.
Therefore, during the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects were further completed, and 68 major projects have been taken into the army since 2014 when the oil explosion began.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
JOY 2.9 MILLION
In a study of the impact of small oil prices on company plans, the most affected projects are listed as deep sea development projects.
While projects taken into operation totalled 27 billion barrels of oil also provide a reserve of fuel, the daily production of 2.9 million barrels of oil by 2025 has been carried out.
According to the study, the first production targets were recorded between 2020 and 2023 when most of the projects were planned for investment.
Between 68 projects this morning, the estimated $170 billion potential investments in the five years ahead of us were estimated to take place, "the majority of $170 billion in deep sea projects."
This is because the investment capital is very high.
It is said that, "70 percent of the deep sea costs are mainly due to heavy oil projects in Nigeria, Angola and the United States of America."
According to the study, the most advanced oil projects are countries in Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of their oil reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, together with 85 percent of the countries with their largest gas reserves in the morning.
While most of your nature waiting for you to go out here is located in the deep sea, you need complex and affordable development solutions such as the creation of a superheated natural gas (LNG) system.
It is also indicated that companies that are the most dangerously affected companies, the deep sea, the oil summit in Canada and the United States of America, have been trying to adapt to the "lower" oil prices scenario.
GERMANY IN IRAN
There was not much more than four years ago: the US and Europe had brought oil to Iran to stop Tahran's nuclear programme, the price of oil was about $110, and Iran's oil demand was discussed how it would be cut off without a direct cut in prices.
And when we get back this week, we'll see a banana scenario.
Petroleum prices have been down for the first time since 2004, and the main reason for this was the U.S. production explosion, and the ambargos applied to Iran are rising.
That's why they're looking at Iran.
As Iran's oil supply increases, there will be more oil spills on the oil market, which is already quite full.
That could be why the prices are below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, who doesn't want to pay for Iran's market, will pump more oil and that a price war will take place between Iran and S. Arabia.
The constructions are not high, and Iran's main target is to record that the rapidly growing oil market in India and Europe is an old partner.
In their previous statements, the Iranian authorities said that they had intended to increase the first stage of the campaign by 500 000 warheads a day and that they would spend more time on the market.
According to Reuters's map information, while 22 usuals in Iran are waiting for very large and high oil carriers (VLCC), they are full of at least 13 or more of them.
Iran has the world's largest fourth-world oil reserves.
As a result of construction exceptions, Iran is also carrying out some 1 million warhead oil spills in some countries where Turkey is also located.
And before the construction, Iran's daily oil consumption went up to three million barrels a day.
Support Menkul’s Exploration Costs According to the White Sky, oil is under 20 dollars: "As China’s central global growth concerns increase the pressure of low oil prices, it increases its oil prices."
In China, China, the world's largest oil producer, we see that the demand for oil is still rising by 20 percent from the start of the oil year.
As a whole, we can witness prices below 30 dollars in oil today as a result of the global price gain and the global oil surplus problem.
As long as we don't see the remaining prices on the $32-33 levels, the oil may be limited and the pressure below increases.
At this point, it can be said that under the critical $30 level, there is a locked role to play in order to continue to be seen by the gates.
In such a case, it should not be surprising that there are cuts of up to 23.30-25.60 in the area of support.
Isham Sardouk said: 'The angel has already finished!'
When Victoria's Secret and the world's fashion trends were over the WGSN, why did you turn the road into Turkey?
- I'm always aware of the change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, and then I went to New York.
I've got some important positions over there.
During this time, I've been talking to Coton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this graph and in Coton.
I realized that everything needed to be locked up in a store at the time of the world.
Now I'm here to make this happen.
Will you be able to make it in a short time?
- Sure.
Even though he's already a young brand, he's currently sold in 50 countries.
We're doing 50 collections a year. There's 15 separate sections.
So there's everything you need to have in a store.
From Dubai to Moscow, we can meet the needs of tourists from different backgrounds.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, and it's starting a new and exciting time...
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is a city.
But you'll open some shops for image.
Paris, the fashion presidents like London have a store, you're making money from the Middle East.
One is needed for a brand that's on loan, the other money, both of which are on the market.
So let's talk about trends...
- We have a very romantic, nice season.
They're flyin' tunics, soft tones, peppers, whites, reds.
Draw...
We're going through very difficult and painless times, and in these difficult times, the fashion world is always looking forward to a life of happiness by carrying on its opening designs.
That's what we did.
That's why it's coming back in the new season.
Let's go back to Victoria's Secret years.
Who was the most ephemeral angel?
I'm not just talking about great physics: That's so positive, that's such a good girl!
When I was working, he sat next to me and said, "You're hungry."
He was so cute.
You know why I'm talking about it, and I've been looking into all Victoria's Secret Models.
How beautiful Karolina is, isn't she?
But Adriana Lima was very impressed with her beauty.
- Yeah, that sound!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you will say, "Sit on one side and be nice and don't do anything else."
It's bringing brains.
That's right. That's what's happening.
I've been reporting with Candice Swanpool.
She was the best girl I've ever seen in my life, but I fell into a mess about unemployment.
- Most of it's like that.
Not like the new angels before...
I remember Gisela's turn, and...
And it was hard to work with him.
She's coming in. She's smoking like a sister.
Not because she's Tyryaki.
No one's drinking. One can drink!
The goal is to make a diva.
Victoria's Secret Service, published two months ago, took the lowest rate in history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, it's over with the angel of beauty.
I'm sorry. Who's gonna do Gigi Hadid?
What's so nice?
Kendall Jenner's e-mail, like...
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Kate Moss's translation is zero, but it's called the biggest fashion industry.
- Yes, but how beautiful his face was.
I want to use my right of residence here.
I've been reporting last year.
- It's smoking, drinking, it's crazy now.
But there was such a beautiful face in the docks.
They were like Bardot in Brigitte.
That supermodel came to an end.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was next to me and I saw no pain in the morning.
Such a state of beauty can't be such a cure.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's losing himself.
There's no place in every campaign.
People are falling.
There's no hunger for famous models and celebrity.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
We're gonna go over it.
Because that's the trend.
A letter from 25 writers to Turkey
According to BBC Turkey, the International Writers' Union (PEN) has also been found among the leaders of England, Galler and Scotland; it has become a part of the lives of its colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey.
In the letter, two attacks aimed at the Hurriet newspaper in Turkey, led by the Koza Group's press, led by Vice News's representatives, were among the disturbing developments in the press and the arrests.
Mother had a dispute about working half a mile.
Turkey-Work "We think that mothers are entitled to half work so civil work can be restored."
When he said, "This might be a turva horse," TISK said, "We're worried that this adjustment will stop women from working."
The new rights of the member and the female worker, which were intended to bring forth children after birth or adoption, were passed on to the Commission through all day-to-day discussions.
After birth, six and a half months of working time or free of charge was the most common issue in the Commission's discussions of the half-time work that led to the first time the child was "citizenly"
The CHP Izmir Nationalist Moses Cham said, "If you bring up a rental plan after this, we'll face it to the end."
He said, "We have doubts as to how a woman's place of work will be filled in in half the time."
He said that while the government's business is going to work with this vice again on a daily basis, there will be new problems that will lead to disaster: "We will therefore be concerned about the progress of its own offices."
In addition to the statement by TISK Secretary General Bulent Pirler, "No longer long-term part of work is available in other countries for five years."
And look at the case.
He said, "In places where 1 or 2 employees work, you have to think about the consequences of this application."
TOBB Director Ahmet Schağar said that while the application was running through, the employee found it difficult to find a job.
The lawyer, who said that there was no issue of rules for half-term work, said, "The separation between the employee and the manager should be ensured if there is a special wish to be settled with his offices."
Text Beside: We Do Not Support
Feyzioğlu's explanation is, "We don't share this information, we can't participate and we can't support it."
Because there's no connection to the PKK.
You couldn't tell the PKK, you couldn't say anything to a terrorist group, you didn't throw dust on it.
It's just that we don't really see and we don't know what's going on in the government.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
We'll follow him if there's a legal conflict between government representatives, public officials and security forces in this framework.
When we say "Don't break the State," they attack us as "Partner, Fascist".
And when we say, "This government must act with justice, and it must always do so," they say, "You make division."
We're growing.
We're always responsible for telling the truth.

Who's Bergen?
His original name was Bergen, who was born in Mersin on 16 December 1960.
With the divorce of his mother and father, his mother settled in Ankara in 1966 with Sebahat Chakr.
After Yunus Emre Ilkokululul entered the Piano section of the Ankara State Conservatory, but because of financial difficulties, he worked at PTT for a period of time.
In 1979 he accepted his offer to work at the Feyman Night Club to have fun with his friends.
At Feyman Night Club, the Group of Lokomotif orchestra was conducted with the repertoires of the Turkish Art Music, the Turkish Hafif Music and the course of the cycle.
Bergen, who went to Adana after Ankara, met Halis Serbes here and married a year later.
In 1982, Atlas Plak released the first Longitude of the "Air of My Life" from the Atlas.
Bergen, who could not rely on his husband's violence while leaving the art world, escaped many times from his wife.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, her husband was raped and shot at her.
In this attack, Bergen, who lost his only eye and lost a large part of his body, was convinced by the other song "Kimbimir" that praised Kibariye after his treatment, was convinced by Kengiz Ozzeker.
In 1985, the artist Izmir Pravyon, who was owned by Özšeker, produced a demo tape called "Kader Kader" together with his boss at Izmir Pravlanta Pavyon, where he was the owner of Ozšeker and sent it to Kekeva.
Kekeva, who likes Bergen, invited the artist Istanbul.
At the end of 1986, the artist who led Burhan Baiar's music management "Man Severse" in the first professional longplay on the Istanbul music market won the praise of "The Woman of Pains" in the late 1986.
The album was awarded by the platinum company in November 1987 with the title "The Most Satanic Arab Women's Artist in 1986" by Golden Plak and Golden Caset.
The same year, with the Senate and management of the State of Warakalin, the "Women of Pains" went to the camera with the alone Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron.
Bergen, who made a big surprise shot, was finally rescued from the bloody attack on Adana that he went to for the concert.
The artist, who once took the stage, produced the album "He Is My God", "I Love" and "I don't want" under the direction of Salami Shahin, Uz Sheniya and Kengiz Tekin.
In November 1989 he returned to the stadiums in 1989, where he was officially divorced from his husband, Bergen, who was living with the "Years of Affetmé" my last album.
On August 14, 1989, the artist who started my album's recognition tournaments on the interest rate was killed by his wife, Adana Pozantti, who was divorced on August 15, 1989.
The state was in Mersin.
Bergen, a 29-year-old short-lived 5 longplay and 11 casette recordings of 129 songs and videos.
Idiots in the way that the artist described it with a different and powerful voice gained the truth from the first day of the "Goden Youth" album that was released after his death.

Nazim Wisdom understood on the day of birth 114
Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the State Secretary, was born in 114th of his birth in "Good Christmas" activity.
The activity organized by the Konak University was carried out in a salon named Shirin at the Beautiful Cultural Center.
The famous ensembles, theaters and cinemas were played by the Western Foundation for Music and Music.
In addition, the Three Anadol Music Society has been associated with the Asyrians.
Nazim was co-existing with the work of Wisdom in many arts.
Among these were Ali Electoral Recipients, Erkoch Tower, Zenep Heaven Star and the Blue Star.
In Istanbul, the Nazim Wisdom Culture and Art Department was organized.
Deputy President Rutka Aziz and members, the wife of Nazzim Hikmet, Vera Tulyakova's daughter, came into contact with Tarabya for the role of the player History Akan.
He's going to read jokes with his slogan "Just like a tree to live and sing and his sister like a forest" and leave kangaroos in the sea.
The activity organised by the Council of Lords will coincide with the Song of Wisdom.
The Nazim Wisdom came into the world on October 15, 1902.
The world's famous city of Nazim Hikmet has been transformed into more than 50 languages.
He has been arrested several times for his political ideas and spent most of his adult life in prison or in prison.
They have been changed into different languages, and they have received many rewards.
He died in 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Beldi, the world-famous singer Nazim Hikmet made special efforts on the day of the 114th birthday.
The 11-year-old Bursa Cezaevi was the first time in Turkey's history of singing in the "Nazi of Bursa" season.
Thus, in cooperation with PTT Turkey's history, the first personal money was issued on behalf of Nazim Hikmet.
This special money with 1.40 TL will be booked to the malls on Friday, 14 October, on the night of the Nazim Wisdom Culture.
They'll be out of line with bike.
But since there is no agreement between the two countries, most of the Syrian refugees will have to return to Russia with 20 degrees this time.
In the summer months, a group of volunteers flew from Murmansk to Norway on their way to Russia, flying north of the country.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow border crossings as a bridge, the migrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Now, Norway has decided to send these agents back.
That's why Norway's security gave instructions on the maintenance of vehicles that have been abandoned across borders.
The "Turkey 3 billion Euro" crisis in the EU
TURKYE is facing a crisis of EUR 3 billion, which has been defined as a candidate for Turkey.
The European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker, Italian President Matteo Renzi, has blocked the fund to be transferred to Turkey.
Juncker outlined below that the EU has to find 3 billion euros, indicating that the spirit is not good between the rest of Europe and Italy.
Juncker, "It's not for Turkey's money for the Syrian soldiers in Turkey."
We haven't reached three million yet.
"It's a matter of EU confidence, and that's why it's important."
Juncker said he expected the money to be completed until October 26, the date before it was given.
Italy takes a position among countries that take due account of Turkey's word.
Diplomatic sources, when Roma's financial package situation is not directly related to Turkey and it is related to problems between the EU Commission and some countries of the Union.
I've been living between the EU and Italy for a while.
In the last EU summit on Renzi, energy, banks and migrants, German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU managed to make it a hard language.
At the press conference, Juncker, who quoted Renzi as saying, "The colour must stop blaming the EU."
"The fact that I love myself very much is wrong for the EU Commission to fall down on every opportunity."
Juncker told me Renzi was playing in the inside.
The three billion euros promised to Turkey will be awarded by the EU budget.
Two billion euros will be provided from the budgets of the Member States.
Germany will provide at least 427 million euros.
For political reasons, the Romanian Government, which announced that it would not transfer the money to Turkey, decided to transfer it to the EU budget for use with support of the 2.3m euros in its contribution.
The source is expected to be used during 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw Chalie Hebdo's caricature
The Russian official spoke to Agent Sputnik, Abdullah Kurdi, and said, "If you want to be right, I've cried for this caricature."
He said, "I felt so bad."
The French historian Charlie Hebdo, who became a symbol of freedom of expression after his armed assault, said:
They've done a bad caricature.
Everyone was so sorry about this cartoon.
A 2-year-old boy and he died.
Dylan, I and my family needed to show respect for Charlie Hebdo, but it was completely different.
This story should show respect for the dead children.
The Prophet has been declared disrespectful to our master.
And they set up rivals to Allah.
It is a small thing for me to have my child before Allah and His Messenger.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbili, made this call: "I call the whole world and the history of the universe, everyone must respect the dead children."
Their families should not suffer pain.
The still-born Tima Kurdi of Yaylan Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also one of those who responded to karikaturismo.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau has the title 'may be one of the poets in Germany' when the Syrian Island Kurdi, 3 years old, killed the dead body in a signed karikatum.
Last year, when Mr. Muhammad published cartoons, the French history of mass murdering 12 people by radical dentist Charlie Hebdo was a room of debate over the karikatism he spoke of by Island Kurdi.
In Karikatur, Germany's capital city of Cologne, as was the women's aunts living during their annual celebrations, were portrayed as rapists calling on women to hunt dogs and migrants.
It's actually part of a four-carcase column that causes different reactions to social media.
On the column, "France isn't this" and, according to a lot of reading, it is becoming increasingly hostile with other values that belong to France.
On the other hand, it's because many people blame Charlie Hebdo for stealing.
The story of Charlie Hebdo, who, in a recent year's published number of thousands of dollars' receipts, went to Germany, where he held out an objection to open doors for French migrants.
When it was said "He was very close to his mother," he wrote "Two children's menu at one price" in a commercial release.
'The Germans who died in Sultanahmet in Germany'
According to news on the website of Der Spiegel's weekly report, the German Federal Court decided that 10 people who had died in the attack were brought to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be attended by a plane belonging to the German Air Force today or tomorrow at the country and airport.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission on the Federal Criminal Service (BKA), who conduct legal proceedings, go to countries where they have been identified and autopsies for victims of natural disasters or attacks.
But Der Spiegel's story said this time would be different.
According to the level, officials from the Federal Criminal Service have applied the Turkish authorities to ensure that the deaths are identified and processed in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities have not accepted this offer.
The Federal Criminal Court has sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists who have been attacked in the attack are carrying medical treatments.
Ellen Meiksins lost his life
A well-known politician and socialist historian, Meiksins Wood, took into account their important work on the sources of capitalism.
In 1942, Latvia was born in New York and released in Turkey by Meiksins Wood as follows: Escape from the class -- Capitalism Behind the Culture -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- Capitalism Against Capitalism -- The cause of capitalism -- The Empire -- Back to Marx
Cordless Air Force Law for Men
The German press report indicates that the social services in the home will remove the law of the deceased when it is announced that the message of the local social services is understood by refugees.
In his statement to the WDR, the social security officer Markus Schnapka said that a number of people who were involved in the conduct of the event did not want to punish innocent people because of their conduct, said they were informed in three languages about the values that were important to them in Germany.
Schnapka also added that Germany would punish every kind of attack and rape, not to dispute the value of gender equality.
On the other hand, Carnival was cancelled in Rheinberg due to the possibility of living in the nearby caravan routes of the tacit scandals that existed in Koln.
In fact, he heard that the carnival passage was cancelled because there was no guarantee that we wouldn't survive.
What are the benefits of breast milk?
It's becoming popular in the veins with a technique that doesn't kill vitamins and minerals.
Hundreds of years ago, the most preferred drying technique in the Far East became a powerful source of metabolism and eased my balance.
Like malnutrition, bacteria and microps in the veins are completely dead by this process that completely removes their problems.
Proteins, celluloses, and nutrients in the liver are completely absorbed by this technique, which makes food more softer.
Do not cook in a small press; it is done in a factory using steam doors or a steam machine.
The amount of water used in high-pressure printing is low.
This can be shown as the best example of how to cook on a wet surface.
In particular, you must first wash your dishes thoroughly and then wait for them to clean up properly by placing them inside the filter.
A deep window is filled with water in three places and placed in the wind filter window.
Tenzer's mouth will be left half shut.
So the storm gets out of the window in peace.
The green fire is first brought to the highest level by providing the source of water and then the green fire by bringing it to a lower level.
For about 10 to 15 minutes, the muscles and muscles are controlled by a catheter’s help after they are well shaken.

It's a healthy way to make your brain look, color, and taste.
You're gonna eat yourself. You're gonna have the same taste.
So the quality of your food and your pleasure are not disturbed.
At the same time, one of the most economic ways of cooking is to cook at least five.
There is also a pleasant visit to the village with more alive and alive appearances.
This method is often preferred because it is often used in diets.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Space "son" album
We know you're going to die; without telling anyone about it, making that last album, making your bed of death, making it a artistic expression in the clip you pulled...
It's like this; we can look too "fly" for the world's fans.
I'm talking about worldly fans because I'm among those who believe that the man who does this is immortal and distant.
From the other side of the universe came Our earth; now it has returned to its originality; and from it it it has become all things.
It came because there was only one inspiration that Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga needed to be given to all the world's artists.
He's done his job with dignity.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5
He probably got rid of him from Warhol, from Kubrick, from the same planet.
When Apollo 11, on May 11, he decided to say, "Is this something I'm a stranger," and he met us by saying, "Space Odity."
Actually, he didn't get along; he always took a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways to lose because of him.
The music and the audience...
If we leave it to plastic art, it's wrong to say "only music" for music.
The characters that turn from the song to the song and create poetry; their messages, their youth, and their creativity, give me a artistic overall expression.
I can't see myself as the father of a glamm rock or the cousin of a punk...
If that's what happens to those random electronics, what's gonna happen to the disaster that he's kept in love since he was a kid?
David Bowie reminded us what the word meant to us all these years when we threw the icon into our mouth.
He wasn't a man, he wasn't a woman, he wasn't a "man."
It was a body.
We had a mission for a while.
That's the body; the 26th studio album was released "Blackstar" two days after it was released.
Before my album was released, we listened to Blackstar and "Lazarus" and tried to convince him that he was going to go with us.
We thought, "He's gone now and he's talking about death," and he was aware of everything.
Last game...
The message and message of my album was published much earlier than "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", but it was re-registered for this album "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime), "'Tis A Pity She Was Was A Whore" when the album was released.
I'd like to say, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Doller Days" are very good songs.
When we look at it all, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's so drunk, it's like "Blackstar" made with instant feelings...
Neither death nor a history account album...
It's just a real "son" album.
The song "The End" of a musical life that began at the end.
Turkey was targeted in the Sultanhamte attack
The German Federal Security Department, Holger Münch German, in a program that participated in the first channel of the ARD, met on Saturday in the Sultanahmet Area and reported on an attack on the lives of 10 German citizens.
Münch said the target of the attack was not German citizens, it was Turkey.
"400 KINDNESS"
But Münch, pointing out that the Sultanahmet attack has not changed the terrorist threat in Germany, said, "We are still under a serious threat."
The number of people who went to Syria to join Germany to participate in the Ishid has shown that there is a decrease in the number of people who have returned from the war zones, while many people have noticed that Münch has returned from the war areas.
Münch, who said that this was a major challenge from security units, said, "There are nearly 400 dangerous people we need to keep out of my sight right now."
Münch called for better coordination between police organisations in Europe and for closer communication.
The Turkish authorities indicated that the live bomb that was responsible for the Sultanhamat attack was Syria's neighbor and ISID member, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizere said that the identity of the attack had not yet been identified.
The voice echoes the action scenes
In the 40th year of the concert series, Sesen Aksu grew his love for the "Years of Sezen" concert that he gave to Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first section was held in Volkswagen Arena between 15 and 16 October.
At the AK concert, all of his listeners have been traveling for 40 years today.
The series of loving songs that have touched our personal lives has been a highlight of the public talk that brings us, our country, and our world closer together.
After he made the concerts he promised, Aksu, who said he'd give his life back to the scene.
In the series "Seven Years" Sezen Aksu, Volkswagen Arena, he published a separate story against the fans.
He took every story, show, light and stage show monitors into ballast courses.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, a video show was also held that took place at the Istanbul Tables of Devrim Erbil.
The case also took place in the video scene that was previously recorded by the first monsters, and it put them in the scene.
There's been 25 rounds of dinner in Ankara and Istanbul.
In Ankara, about 250 grams of milk per day began to be sold from 1 TL.
A new year ago, especially in the mid-month "the harvest time" was presented in explanations as "no time" by Güda, Tarim, and Animal Health Minister Faruk Célik.
However, in Ankara, 250 grams of milk was sold from 1 TL a day.
President Halil Abraham Balc of the Turkish Federation of the Turkish French Federation of 25-year-olds who came to the camp said, "It wasn't time, two years ago the tariff decision began to apply," and he added:
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Esnaf Room Unit set this rate two years ago.
A price applied mostly in Turkey.
I mean, a new time interview wasn't made and it wasn't going to cost.
But because of the recipe, he was selling 75 cows in some parts of Ankara.
In some areas it was already sold to 1 TL.
In the meantime, he didn't have to pay the price he trusted in his bread. So they're gonna have to apply 1 TL from the counter.
There's no increase or time.
They're applying the unimplemented price.
"In the first half of 2016, we will definitely not exceed 5 TL if we don't live with this year's price."
In some areas, Istanbul also began to sell at 1.25 TL.
Terror has found Burkina Faso this time.
In an attack by foreign and United Nations officials in Burkina Faso, West Africa lost 23 people from 18 different countries.
The attack was carried by the North African hand of El Qaide.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after the terrorist action of the world's most vast Muslim country, Ishid, with 250 million troops.
The foreign embassies, luxury hotels and stores are in a busy range of Starbucks and the police point of day-to-day bombings and armed attacks; a Canadian and an Indonesian life has been lost.
The Indonesian authorities explained that the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on 13 November.
British BBC TV security lawyer Frank Garner noticed this action, and recently he noticed that it was part of a scary exercise that was shown in many parts of the world.
The U.S. recently burned his blood out of terrorist acts.
Early in the summer, 14 people were killed in an armed attack that set up the ISHID summit in San Bernardino, California, U.S.A.
"San Bernardino" attack on the U.S.
In Sultanahmet, 10 German tourists died after a live bomb killed by General Thomas and Maizere of Germany, "We have lived in Paris two major attacks."
If we say that, then the terror will be won...
We used the expression "before I take it."
ISID Whatsapp is talking about using Alaravi
According to a new report, terrorist organizations use their own communication tools to communicate independently from communication applications such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
Defende One's report says he's using a new message to communicate between himself.
This program, called "Aravi" and Android, is distributed and loaded in an APC file.
The application is known to communicate encrypted messages and media sharing between themselves.
Download flash from Ishid to Iraq
The application's performance remains "ink" against popular applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, according to the Ghost Security Group.
It's not yet known how powerful the encryption is.
IT WAS in progress on a Telegram application that allowed you to send a message over an encrypted connection.
However, the Telegram, which members of the ISI, were talking about, was in the middle of the channels.
In addition, the U.S. administration requires that the back door be set for applications from application developers.
So instead of trusting whatsApp and Telegram's encryption, the virus is starting to use its own solutions instead of using its own software.
UAEA: Iran's nuclear agreement followed
Kerry, who spoke at a press conference in Vienna, explained that Iran had implemented the nuclear agreement on the basis of what had happened and that the U.S. had officially removed economic structures for Iran: the International Atomic Energy Agency (UAA) had informed Iran that it had implemented the necessary powers at the nuclear agreement.
Iran's Prime Minister Hasan Ruhani heard from Twitter that he welcomed the removal of post-nuclear agreements between the six countries of the world and Tahran in his message to the Iranian people.
Veterans champion Fenerbach!
Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Trabzonsport's four Great Tournaments fought together in the league form of the final game, which was played last night by the four Great Salon Tournaments.
He was a champion, Fenerbach, who won 8-6 matches at the Spur Salon.
The fast-paced Fenerbach, especially with Marco Aurelio's active game, closed the first half of 5-1.
In the first few minutes of the second cycle, Galatasaray, who had a great print show, brought the school to 5-5.
However, Fenerbach, who managed to shoot the shock, won the fight 8-6.
In Fenerbach, Elvir Balic, Mehmet Aurelio, and Seyhon, he published such expressions as Ayhan Akman, Omit Karan, Pope Mustafa, and Hasan Shash in Galatasary.
How should a semi-trailer be evaluated?
How should the students evaluate the day-to-day calendar? We asked the professor of education and training to Murat Moon.
For secondary school students only; listening, having fun, television and computer should not be taken into account.
It's a very important opportunity to prepare for the new course of education and to explore the course of history.
A half-tali, called free time, is also an important opportunity to develop personality development, information, hope and hobby at the same time.
Make the appropriate evaluation list.
Write everything you plan and try to apply it.
I'm sure you'll be surprised at this and you'll have a generous summer period.
Let's talk about how this should be a given summer period for students who are preparing for the YGS-LYS.
Because the most important questions we have about our friends who are preparing for the YGS-LYS tests are: "How should we evaluate this period, how should we solve a lot of questions, or whether we have some pressing issues?"
To answer these questions and to make sure that they are answered, let us make a written note of the advice to those friends who are willing to take the test first.
We've been trying to complete this in the last 1 year, when there's to be a period starting from the 9th class under normal conditions, and it's going to be forced to spend more effective, accurate and more accurate years for us.
At the same time, the last class student has to work with his school writing work at the same time.
Even if the postgraduate student has entered at least one test (YGS-LYS) at least once and has experienced it, it is also critical for him to prepare the post exam again as a postgraduate student.
Because most of the message students and their family are seeing 'O' as the last chance of the year, and this brings more stress to the ground.
Training; learning, not having fun, just doing it because it makes you feel forced, and so it's usually the last thing you've ever done, but it's it; it's a completely task for those who do it and become morally immoral, and what's always going to be done is a plan.
Now we have half the talent, and we have to evaluate it in the best way.
And for this to happen, it must be a plan that will make us manage our time well.
Practice exercises in half of the year:
Everyone needs to plan their own situation first.
1st, what was done, what was left of it; day, week, and 15 days.
Within this period, there must be re-examines and issues solutions.
At the same time, students who do not have a high rate of performance can test the mean 1-2 test.
Alleve Your Exquisite Affairs: Research; 75 percent of what people learn shows that they forget 66 percent in one week, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to get rid of it is to do it again.
In particular, students who make more mistakes than they have done in the past have to make it more difficult for them to work again.
First investigate your emergency issues and plan day by day, place the matter every day, and take care of them.
This planning will comfort you both academicly and psychologically.
And watch out for the most wrong things you've ever done when you put them into your plan.
Because you're not going to be such a long holiday in the future.
Questionnaires:
It's very important to resolve the matter until we do it again.
Because we can see how much work we've done, but we've solved it by asking questions.
Do not forget to put a certain number of questions every day.
The number of questions you're going to solve may vary according to the work you're going to do on that day; you can't solve a lot of questions on a day when you're working hard, but at least we need to make it clear to you how much we've learned about that day.
Solve Tests:
Another job you're going to do on half a year's salary must be to solve the tests.
As long as it's not over, you can do at least training tests.
So let's say you've made a great Turkish school there, and you can solve the trials of a 40-year-old Turkish school.
And of course you're doing it and do it for a while.
40 Turkish question if you can solve it in the first 60 minutes, then your next goal may be to solve it within a few minutes.
Tatil and Hobi Plan:
It's not just teaching work; it's just a few days you've got to separate for the holidays, listening, and having fun.
It's just going to prevent you from being out-of-the-town and listening to a holiday time for training.
So there must be special times you're going to separate yourself from your plans.
Reading books, watching television, surfing the Internet can be within your plans, and you will find the most important thing to do.
I'm going to have a little advice for friends who say I haven't been given my first time.
If I didn't have my first time, I didn't work very well, and if you say too many of my ex-girlfriends, that's a great opportunity for you.
But first you have to make a decision about it and believe it.
The waves were dropped between 76 and 90 minutes during the 2009-2010 season at the top football league in Turkey.
Now, you answer the question you're asking, is the game over and you're going to the seedroom, or is the game still going on and you're going to put a lot of minutes on top of it?
I don't think anyone wants to say, "We're gonna watch the games in front of us" that's a hit football team or a classic game that's used by players.
Now the only thing you're gonna do is leave the past and look ahead to you, not to walk away.
If we can collect what we say:
1) Make a half-tali plan first,
( 2) Do what you know.
( 3) Take care of your ex-wifery affairs.
( 4) Do your best to resolve the matter,
( 5) Solve the trials,
( 6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new cycle,
(O Prophet), set aside time for yourselves and your cattle and that which you take for yourselves.
( 9) Spend time with your family and your friends
10) Share time with social and cultural activities (synema, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnics etc.)
'Kervan' has gone a long way
Each averaged 1,000 metres from 45 stores in Turkey's largest 'home' store, with one of the largest 'home' stores, and the founder of Kervan Demirel and his son Hasan, at home 17 and 25 stores in the home.
Recently, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores outside of the home with completed commercial steel operations.
"Now we're going to have a smaller store with Kervan and Home Sweet Home."
He said, "Kervan will be opened out of the house."
In 2015, a total of 50 million lira from home Sweet Home and 90 million TL from Kervan and a total of 140 million lira cirols were released, and my production was in jail.
The total sales area of Kervan, which has 45 stores in 35 years, is 45,000 metres.
Twenty-five stores belong to the main company.
I want about 500 people in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 shops outside the house and the total sales area is 6 000 metres and 320 people work.
I've produced a joint Alev Pact, a home Sweet Home Management Board, which makes it possible for me to be very happy with Kervan, "We are Mardinoli and we entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, we've had a brand with the support of Chinese Beyers.
It's "TRT" of this sector.
We've learned a lot from him.
We even started giving our first step to the store by handing us his Ac Central Store.
We were working as a strategic partner, not as a rapist with Kervan.
He said, "Now there's going to be a very serious synergy with this union."
Boy, now Home Sweet Home has found 17 stores out of the country, and they've started in exile in China last month.
"We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed to a 200-storey jail.
"We will then develop a small store with Home Sweet Home as well as a big store outside the home," he said.
He sells his factory in Poroshenko Russia.
Roshen CEO, who reported to the Liga.net news site on the matter, said Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moscowsky, "Yes, we sold the factory."
He said, "It does not come out of the market, and all the truthful are lost."
Concerning the cost of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, "We have been designated as about 200 million dollars."
Each year, 450 000 tons of chocolate and sugar are produced by Roshen, one of the world's largest producers, and is owned by the President of the State of Ukraine by Pedro Poroshenko.
The star's been Pladis outside of Holding's place.
The Star Holding grouped global companies that were active in the beer and chocolate sectors that they bought under the name "Pladis".
With the combination of Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and the World Trade Union, there was a new $5.2 billion debt for 26,000 people working.
In a meeting on the integration of global companies at Star Holdings, President Murat Mürat Müllker, who spoke about the integration of planetary companies, said, "Our goal has been to be a global company since we first started," and added:
Murat Müller published 335 million live commercials from Periscope
This company, established 72 years ago, is now developing to become a global brand and global company in the field of beer chocolate production under the name of Star Holding.
During this period, we developed from foot-and-mouthed chocolates, from ammbamencules, personal appearances, and all kinds of numbers.
We're at 77 factories operating in 14 countries, with 300 brands and thousands of sales points.
"We want to focus on our mother's work, and we want to be global in this area, and we are reorganised for this," said the country, who said that the whole Star Holding created "a loving family of 50,000 people."
Country's father, Sabri Bey's life story
We reassess our company, we reorganize it.
We have divided the earth into regions.
And we shared these areas with the CEOs.
We'll have our CEOs in the Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff.
He is responsible for the Third World, the Middle East of Turkey, K. Africa and the Turkish Peoples.
Mohammed Elsarky, next to our global Godiva work, is the American continent and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for England, China and Africa.
I can say that it's a kind of calit and innovation group, Ali Lülker, when I deliver a global message in its own field, and Cem Karakash will be my assistant in the management of the work.
China, Russia will be part of South-East Asia, and there will be areas for development.
Murat ülker SAF GYO has sold her feel at GYO
His words, "We are happy for the whole world every summer," are "The name of our global company Pladis which we have created to do this."
"Where did you come from?" Pladis said, "this name actually has no special meaning," and added:
They call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Iran, Pervin.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the seven star star Pleiades star team from Latine to the Mediterranean.
I mean, we translated the country as a global translation.
Star Holding Management Board Vice-President Ali Lülker, in collaboration with laboratories in various countries, pointed out that "we started to create synergies in innovation" and added:
We've got very valuable AR-GE teams, and we've got so many different synergys working on an AR-GE platform.
Under Pladis, we have 27 regular Ar-GE centres.
These are the biggest in Turkey and England.
This is where our dear AR-GE expert works for 300.
They even started to give results.
Digestives, which was created in the country and is to start moving to England, is produced in Silivri at the country's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: The brands are different but the products are the same country as the Crispian.
We have won our country under the name of a beautiful country called the Cricklys Cricklys Cracklys, a cracker technology developed in England.
Laviva, who we all know, met today with tourists in America.
Call of Duty series exceeded 250 million
This series of events, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer games are known as gold letters, and it seems that the long years will not be forgotten.
The number of sales that have been specifically explained is to give us ample evidence of how detailed we should be.
The Activization, which had no license rights at the time of the year, showed 250 million copies of the license at the end of the year.
The company that shared the sales number of the whole series last year has been able to sell 75 million more calls of Duty since then.
We're not going to make a lot of this number if we're going to make Black Ops 3 games.
Once more General President has been elected
In the event, Kemal Kalidora, who was elected President of the House of Commons, was re-elected.
He was the former president who took 990 from the 238 members of the House of Commons.
The number of plays that have been played is invalid.
After the outcome was explained, the parties were in a happy show.
A total of 275 delegates from the CHP were present.
Kurulta finished her work on meeting at 10 a.m. on Friday.
And in the set of swords, he said these things:
We wanted him to play games here, tell the Turks.
But it's not like we're here at the moment.
There's a truth to Turkey that doesn't control.
The atmosphere that's going on is all of it.
The reason for the Karamsar table is that they manage the country.
As CHPs, wherever you come from, whatever you come from, we're against you.
Terror is a human sin and terrorists should never be pardoned.
Terror is fought with intelligence and intelligence, and with riffon.
Of course we fight. We want someone to get this.
What's the difference between the photos in Syria and the photos in Lebanon, and the photos in the South?
When they sat on the table, they made serious mistakes.
The blood of the eagle, its eye, and all the rest of the dead are accountable.
In 2002, they took the country with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey returning to its blood.
Who is responsible for this?
The taxi driver in the diyarbakur?
What's he paying for in Turkey?
We're going to attend the meetings as a whole on the change of labour laws, and we're going to get our minds over.
We won't let anyone build a country on their personal meetings.
I say, "Let's change the working spirit."
In the morning, their houses are sealed up, and they are taken into custody because they have explained their views.
There are ways that we don't share, but people must be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "He eats the government's bread and hates the state."
And I want to ask him, why don't those who ate the government's bread and took advantage of the government's every opportunity to do so?
The largest change in the CHP is the country's party.
We'll always make preparations together for the fourth major revolution.
Whatever the case, we will certainly bring free democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can take care of us, they can do whatever they do, no matter how difficult it may be, this country will bring freedom to the CHP.
I'm calling you straight, David.
It's not behind the law of law. The man who hid it didn't throw his mind off the job.
You gave the guy who gave you the tip of the service.
What kind of work are you talking about?
Let's get back to the people.
The party authorities organized another three revolutions: the establishment of the Community at the end of the first major revolution; the establishment of the Community during the second major revolution; the transition to social democracy by Bulent Ecevit during the second revolution; and the transition to social democracy by Bulent Ecevit...
He has qualities and responsibilities.
Article 103 contains the oath of the master of the vineyard.
We know how important it is in this community that I have a reputation and honor.
If a man goes out and gives this word, he will do it to his death.
Because namus and honor are not discussed for us.
The man who's a dictator's son-in-law, doesn't mean honor and nuance for you.
What do you understand about honor and honor, why did you make this oath?
What do you mean by namus and honor?
I want to know that.
The religious man has a reputation for honesty and honor.
It's not their intention to remove the law of the court. It's to judge the law of the court.
They don't want the capital system.
How's the head? The boss's head system.
Why do you reject Osmanly's parliamentary system?
A man's gonna do everyone's order.
Are parliamentarians working well in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring free democracy, the system works.
They call it work, but they're strengthening the labour law.
Izmir's nationalist Mustafa Balbay, who explained his position as the general president, was unable to participate in the contest because he could not get the signature of the 128 delegates required for the delegation.
"I don't have a name under existing conditions," said the 92 signatory.
In the Kurultay hall, members of the party meclisi (PM), the central transport institution (MYK) and members of the honor-building community were taken into consideration when they were assigned to the former CHP Leader of the Seaz Baykal party.
And instead of sitting in a separate place for the citizens of the country, the former President sat next to the former president of the Republic.
Yalova's ethnicist Muhammad Ince was one of the issues that he had discussed at the club.
In fact, he explained that he was offered PM membership and that he did not accept it.
But from their general central sources, it was the idea that the need for a meeting was coming from Ince and that the PM membership was not proposed.
And he shared his message from Twitter, "Someone can learn from Istanbul's national Ali Ozcan about the content of the interview."
"How can I know if two people met?"
It's enough to say, "He's gone."
He's got a lot of pressure on him.
On the first day of the "Democratic, Change and Brotherhood" event, the party's (PM) class was attacked.
He started working for the PM list when he went to the next house to talk to the institution.
While preparing the 100-person list of key players, it was learned that the existing members of the MIK who did not want to take place in my administration told me that Jacob Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, and Erkan Karakash will be placed on the list by telephone with 13 members of the MIK, who are no longer known as Seyhan Erdoğdu.
It is indicated that the arrow can mark 100 PM people to a list of keys and can indicate another given list.
As a result of the 21 materials widely accepted at the CHP, DTK was required to remove its cities on the European Local Government Charter, which had been opened on the day, and to increase its local share.
In the notice, "the end of the state of the party", "the establishment of a state of law which can be calculated" also took place.
Kurulthai AK Party Deputy President Selchuk was watched by Ruhsar Demirel from HDP, Idris Baluken, MHP.
The AK Party has left the palace on the way to strengthen the President of the Kaličdoğan.
He said to himself, "I can't accept what he's doing."
In the hall, journalists from Can Dünder and Erdem Güll took their place on the "If you don't burn me, how will the darkness shine out" with a poster written by Kurtce, Turkey and English "Union".
In the morning of July, the Group of Yorum and Ahmet Kaya began with their songs.
Dyarbakir Baro, who spent his life in the armed attack, received a message sent by Tahir Elci's wife, Turkan Ambassador.
Uncle Elvan's mother, Gulsim and his father, Sami Elvan, joined the institution.
It was the most exciting part of the conversation, which you had to pay if you said you would have democracy.
So far, 34 of them, 18 of them, gathered at the CHP in 52, 53 of them in yesterday's Ankara Arena.
My participation is high.
There were more than 15 pounds of CHP in the 12,000 collusion room.
But there was no one who gave the rest of them the right.
The most exciting moment was when Selvi Kildaroğlu's wife entered the hall with her husband.
Wake up, and he continued to greet the two-way parlor.
He didn't mind the discipline he saw in the AK party.
Even when she was talking about the sword, there was a big movement in the area of Arena's area.
Of course, the CHPs, party managers and journalists who wanted to join the party prefer to call for support by understanding themselves.
One CHP administrator tried to state that this was not a bad situation with the words "It's better that parties who think like parties in Korea or the Soviet Union don't sit together and don't move."
There's another difference between the CHP facility, the AK Party or the MHP facility.
These parties are just general leaders talking.
The CHP also becomes a platform where party problems are discussed.
The number of parties wishing to speak in the day-to-day system was too much to be seen in the setting up of President Divan Murat King's period.
There was also a gap between the hundreds and the languages of "The State Is Going Bad" and "You are changing the way out of this hall."
All the CHPs, "Let's do something" and "What to do" didn't have a strong statement on "What to do" question.
The effect of this is that no elections will be made in the next four years.
When we got into a shooting hole, we were waiting for the reporters to tell us what to do.
He said, "What's going on"?
He paid attention to the issue of detained journalists, to those who were made to the academics, to those who lived in the South, and to the issue of foreign policy.
He gave a long notice of "unsubstantiated parties", "supporters", "elisters' parties" about the party such as "Aadolu" and "Aadolu" for the party.
And when he came down "what to do," he tried to put "strategic" in the middle instead of talking about the amount steps.
He pointed out that it would be possible to bring more justice to a stronger democracy than all these problems.
He also made a promise to the CHP, and "We'll do whatever we can to bring democracy."
He said, "We're going to fight his death for democracy."
One last note; it should be remembered that the CHP has dealt with the "organization" issue in the course of its 53rd session, and that it is now possible to collect it without problems.
Meanwhile, a card was printed for 900 journalists who said they were going to follow the institution, but it wasn't at that level.
And the Ankara representatives of media institutions were not as interested as they were in the AK party.
He asked for help from me.
Dyarbakar, who was arrested by the President of the Republic for 7 counts, was sentenced to 4th term by the General Court.
In India, the PKK/KCK terrorist bodies have been identified as the top-level managers of Diyarbakr, Istanbul, Shránk, Mardin, Mush, Hakkari, Sirit, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Aguri in some years and under the name of "administrative" in some areas.
The idea that youth and women were found in their actions outside the rule of law was expressed by the leaders of Dyarbakir during the years of the Sur, Baghler, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro, which were reported to be increasing in security forces, public organizations and institutions, the homes of fellow citizens, the workplace and their vehicles with long-range weapons and rocket attacks.
ISHID'S HIGH HIGH HOLD OUR FUTURES.
The clashes between the Udden and Kara Mezra, which have been fought by political groups in the Far North and the Ishid, continue to be intensified during the last days of the conflict between the Udden and Kara Mezra.
The voice of the armed forces and aircraft fired during the talks between officials and ISIS, which are close to the border, is also heard by Turkey.
As the waves from the areas where frequent explosions came to the surface, looking out from Turkey, the security forces across the border were confronted with vehicles that were heavily armed.
On the other hand, there was a fire at the City of Mehmet border Karakolu near the village of Kili, which was controlled by Ishid's soldiers.
On that occasion, when he found out about the rules of the U.S. Army, he had a hard and heavy weapon against the area where fire was fired.
According to Idea, Russia has launched an attack on Hamein village, 17 kilometers away from Turkey's border.
Six Syrians injured in the air bomb were brought to the Kili State Hospital for treatment by their neighbors.
Loto took his drawings
Robinson, who lives in a small house in Munford, in the state of Tennessee, preferred to receive a single payment of $328.8 million (about $1 billion) if he would receive a total of $528.8 million over a 29-year period.
He said, "There's no guarantee of our tomorrow, though."
John Robinson, who worked in a store prison, and his wife, Lisa, who worked as an assistant at a dermatologist, said that they would be at the start of the day of the market, although they would now be a millionaire.
The couple plan to pay their home credit first with the money they earn and help their neighbors.
It was explained that the great ikram was divided into three parts.

The company also said that it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for tattoos.
In the past year, FedEx announced that he was going to get 50,000 seasonal workers for the tattoos.

Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx, the nations of the past year have been forced to return to the former elite, which is why it's happening in the Express unit.
But the explosion in the translation trade increased the results of the FedEx Earth Services.
In the last quarter, local services increased by 29 % but the operating income was based on large packages and high prices in the internal security.
When they got into their high-performance business business, they saw an express unit high up because of the high-level ones.
In the pre-opening process about an hour before the opening, FedEx's feelings ranged to $3.85 or $150.15 by %2.5.
On Saturday of the year, they closed under the record level at 11 and 17% in attendance.
At the most widely anticipated meetings in the years ahead, Federal Reserve politicians decided that it would not be time to increase the percentage by almost 10 years this week, spending an average of 27 days on a table with Honduras.
There will be a wall image of the United States of America's two-part meeting room located on one side of the central bank.
Don't remind me that Fed's woman President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues have kept their national economics on everything else.
There are two tasks that the central bank has taken from Congress: to get the U.S. will to the top level and to keep prices stable here.
But since Great Britain, Fed's leaders have admitted that there's been a third of them that's not written.
And this third issue may be an X factor in a close decision that has not been expected to start with a short-term rate of non-comparable warning support from the United States economy that will be announced on Friday, 2008.
While most data show that the economy is growing in a healthy way, the latest developments in the global financial markets can lead to the rise in the number of attention to Fed members, the reference federal fund figures - even in less than one percent of the world's population - by increasing corruption.
"The obvious market for labour force and inflation will be the first and most important thing to watch," said leading economist Lindsey M. Piegza, a trade union firm by Steve Nicolaus & Co.
He said: But I think if they are looking for a treasure to prevent it from growing, it will provide them with what they need in order to wait a little longer for the uncertainty surrounding the world market.
There's no consensus on what Fed's gonna do, and that's what makes it possible for people in their financial markets to get involved.
Half of Bloomberg's economists recently expected an increase this week.
Meanwhile, financial markets expect Fed to be waiting together with a possible increase of approximately 30%.
In this case, while Fed's location is increasing, the policymakers can indicate a fall in the market if they don't underestimate the effect of another increase.
On Saturday, the Dow Jones index averaged 228.89 pounds or 1.4 times 16.599.85.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "The difference was touched by the expectation that the Fed politicians will hold their place this week."
He said, "It would be amazing if Fed would now increase the supply."
If the Feds had decided in this regard, "They would have to take a long year to relax the money markets so they can panic."
Other scientists suggested that a rise in currency could slow down financial markets due to the rise in the time of Fed's interest rate.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be on the way to a 0.25-pound increase, which would be a small step that would enable the US to collect money gradually.
Yellen said despite the demands of liberals for a more economic period, she was expecting this year's growth in the early months and early writing.
Despite the rapid decline in job creation in Augustos, the growth in the labour market has taken place this year.
Last month's unemployment dropped to five, one of the lowest levels in the last seven years, and the level that Fed had in mind was close to the level he had in mind.
He showed signs of gas increases.
And while the central bank of inflation continued to look under the target of the year %2, Fed politicians said that there was an important reason why oil prices that were cut short.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said, "The economy can cope with higher levels and needs this in spite of the quality of the labour market."
But at the end of last month's global financial markets, it started to collapse after China's money went down.
The fact that the Dow Jones stock index mediated down due to the fear that a slow Chinese economy could slow down has led to a 16% decline in the record level in May.
Piyasa, when Dow was under almost 10% of its high level in May, she suddenly collapsed.
The gambling for Fed politicians makes it more difficult to calculate when the interest rate is increased.
UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate research partner and former Fed official Stephen D. Oliner said "They may have been involved in this meeting with the lack of knowledge about the most recent financial markets in the economy in China for a few weeks and the lack of information on economic weakness."
He now expects them to wait at least a month for better management of these effects.
"There is so much uncertainty about what will happen to the U.S. economy and there is almost no data in his hand to link progress in China to the history of progress," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of Fed's primary concerns, so there must be no impact on the technical disclosure process.
But in fact, Fed became the world's secondary power.
The impact of the central bank has been very high in recent years.
Until then, President Ben. Bernanke's only idea was to "increase the paradigm of Fed's global market distortions" in 2013.
In a world where markets and economies are emerging, federal officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere but also to speak to other central bank managers and scientists to read the global economy better.
Investnet Inc.'s asset management firm said that the decision-making process of the world's strategic chief, Zachary Karabell, is "beautiful of my knowledge."
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, V. President Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month "that Fed's past attitude towards financial markets that are not related to economic foundations" has been excessive.
For example, Lacker, who was a member of the Committee on the Rights of the Open Market, who was a member of the Political make-up, has been in favour of its 1998-99 decisions.
Lacker said, "Despite limited recommendations for the increase in the U.S.," the financial crisis in Asia showed that there was a %0.75 point cut instead of showing up during the three meetings of Fed in Asia."
A year later, Fed's agents took back these cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Central Bank of England's Board of Inquiry, said "Fed should only face financial concerns during major crises, as in the 2008 market. "
He said the last game didn't get close to this level.
You really don't want to be afraid of going to an increase in prices, Peterson said President Posen of the International Economic Institute.
The Central Bank's law does not yet have two powers and money, and I don't think they should be in this direction.

Brazil recommends health care during the Rio Grande Pediatrics Committee in Egypt
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS conducted a shocking process to show the importance of health care for women during breastfeeding.
Human milk, many proteins, water, vitamins, and carbohydrates have come to the surface, providing all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system for babies.
Because I need more energy, it is recommended that pregnant women and new mothers increase their daily calorie intake to 500 calories.
What is more, according to new studies, is not limited to the use of calorie, which mothers need to take.
Texas Baylor Tüp College Professor Robert Waterland has been responsible for new work on women's health, affecting the genetic development of their babies by pregnant women.
It's a pity that the ill-equipped child's disability has been affected by the fact that we are not the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise, Nine's leadership in today's show, despite its leadership, has been successful in the reigns.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson were unable to provide an increase in the number of brains that they had done to Canberra for today to reverse the leadership of Liberal.

The last three people who think Bekar Sam Wood is a perfect man, but who will choose him?
Did it go out in the middle?
Lana Jaavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski may have been wondering who will win Bekari.
Sam Wood was in a big secret at the end of Bekar's program.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell us who the last funny area is.
But we'll check Lana Jaavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski the day before the three people hit each other; they may have given a clue about who the winner is.
Sam Wood spent his day at the end of the day
The three women explained why Wood was perfect in a likary language, and they said they wanted to be his partner by hitting on his skill, his reputation, his family values, and his positive attitude.
But "But if you don't, who should take Wood's last smile?" the answers they asked, might include information about who's gonna win The Bachelor's heart.
They called Mackay's best name for Wood, except for Jaavons-Fellows and Marcoski.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been very close since the first day.
Jaavans-Fellows said, "I felt that since I came home, I've been able to think about the energy (Sarah) and Sam's energy, and I've been thinking about it all along the program."
Marcoski added, "Sarah is very practical, very enjoyable to be around."
I saw them once and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable when they're with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a very good couple.
Mackay told me last week that the visitors thought Wood was "the right person."
He said, "When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no more than a game - I'm totally connected to him now."
If he didn't, when he was asked who Wood could choose, he was undercover.
"I don't know if I can say that."
"I love the other girls the same degree - Snezza and Lana are the same."

Jarryd Hayne's career in the NFL became a range of options.
After Detroit and Seattle were transferred to the U.S., she was very interested, and a lot of other teams approached her after the day of the public training last year.
But Hayne San Francisco 49ers and his partner Jim Tomsula chose, and this seems to be a very well-known decision.
Some of the cars were sitting in jail for losing their performance in the Soviet Union, just as it was in a 20-3 battle against Minnesota on Saturday.
But Tomsula believed this guy and found out about Hayne more about Reggie Bush's silence after a game.
After the tomsula game, she continued to show the real color in her bedroom.
Instead of downgrading them in front of the whole team, he gave them comfort.
At the same time, Tomsula supported Hayne in the post-game press conference.
49s team leader Cam Inman said Hayne was also disappointed by the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and forgot about this fall and was advised to think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne, why did Minnesoa Vikings number in the first circle, and he fell into the crowd?
This wasn't what Hayne and her big Australian monster kitten imagined for the first game in the NFL.
Well, after the ball fell out, he saw him and then he refused to go out of the field, and then the Australian radio officer Hamish and Andy said he couldn't think of a better start for NFL's career at 2DayFM 104.1.
He said, "That was just one of those things. You're sorry about the next game, and that's it."
Hyne also recalled the first game of origin with the back steps that led to Queensland in 2007.
Still, I've had a great experience for this 27-year-old player.
In fact, after the game, a post was published in Instagram while holding an Australian flag with its sides.

In Nepal, Police Protechocular Plastic Shooting Kills 4 People · Global Voices
According to an authority on Wednesday, a police officer who was presenting a demonstration against a new mother in the country was killed by fire with plastic bullets, and a 4-year-old boy, including 4-year-olds, lost his life.
On Saturday evening, President Katmandu came to the funeral in Rupandehi, 175 miles away.
The chief of police, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and that some threw stones and bombs.
Mr. Dhakal, before using plastic bullets, said the police had opened fire on the air using a beer gas.
He said half of the police and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets used because they are less deadly than they are.
The conflict has usually been the last of the violent protests that continued for weeks in southern Nepal, and here the members of the Macedonian ethnic group continue to see the political impact of the newly formed regions.
The ethnic group Tharus wants to establish its own governments is doing protest demonstrations in eastern Nepal.
At least 40 people were killed by the police as a memory of 11 violent incidents since August 10th.
They agreed on this date to divide the country into four major political parties - it is also important to prepare for a new motherhood in Nepal, which has been managed by the central government for centuries.
The work on a new mother has continued since 2008, but the legislators have given up this time after the devastating earthquake that struck thousands of people in the month of Nisan and caused the death of thousands of people.
Lawmakers worked on their mother-in-laws in Katmandu this week, and the authorities said the new text would be set up until Friday.

Google has launched an 11 million-dollar matching campaign for Google developers
Google Inc (GooGL.O), a campaign of 11 million dollars to help thousands of people from war-affected and impoverished countries move to Europe to help their civilization.
Google has posted an unexpected personal attachment to me on the blog.
Instead of making this statement by an administrator, Rita Masoud wrote her own personal experience with a seven-year-old Google worker who had fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
He wrote: "In our journey there were many dark buses and trains along the coast of hunger, thirst, cold and fear."
I was lucky.
But my family is very supportive, like my family, because it's growing up in a crisis of malaria and migration in Europe.
Grants, beneficiaries and migrants will go to a four-year-old organization that will help them: the International Rescue Committee, the Office of the High Commissioner for the Rescue of Children and the High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs.
Google said the first $5.5 million worth of google.com/refugeelief would be equal to $11 million.
Europe, 2nd World War, in the face of this most devastating crisis, the biggest reason for this is the Syrian internal war that took more than 4 million people this year, four years.
Many war victims also fled Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

In patients with moderate renal impairment, weight loss can help
According to a new study, type 2 diabetes mellitus may be at least five years of age for the benefit of obese surgery.
But it's early to say that diabetes patients who are banned at average levels have not lived longer to see patients who have not seen surgery since they've been sick.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, a scientist who wrote an article on JAMA's new work on the operation "it takes a long time to identify the circumstances of the universe."
Kilo loses operations using various methods to reduce miscellaneous printing by other means.
These reduce hunger and weaken the body's ability to digest fat.
Within years, type 2 diabetes mellitus has been shown to be active, but most studies have been performed on persons with or above 35 or more dementia.
The BMI, which measures between 185 and 24.9 kilograms, is normally accepted.
25 or more BMI is more than kilograms, and more than 30 BMIs are considered weak.
You can calculate BMI from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, Taiwan's fully-formed Min-Sheng Hospital has used two types of
The average number of patients enrolled in the fifth year of the study was between 31 and 24.5 BMI.
The BMIs of those who saw non-serious surgery remained stable on the 29th of February.
Diabetes has been partially resolved in 36% of patients.
In a treatment group, diabetes has been eliminated in only %1 and only partially in %2.
Also, according to the authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "red" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "group of surgeons" seen.
Researchers have shown blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which in patients at the same time burns blood sugar.
According to researchers, A1c haemoglobin is best kept below 7%.
After surgery, A1c haemoglobin ranged from 9 percent to 6 percent.
The medical treatment group has remained stable in about 8 percent.
However, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and team friends who are conducting a better "glysemic control" study with the A1c haemoglobin levels, these deaths have not decreased during these five years.
The investigation team compared the findings of these two types of operations.
In the fifth year, a group of tuberculosis-nasal groups (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (%3.1 to 2.1) were found to be higher and possibly to recover from all diabetes (%46.9 to 16.7).
In the end of the fifth year of the study, he said that if it did not indicate the immediate benefit of living after the surgery, Dr. Blackstone said that it was a useful data from Arizona Tüp Coleji-Phoenex, which was performed in more than one kilogram of patients in Switzerland.
In this Swedish work, the number of obese patients diagnosed with biliary surgery has dropped by 29 percent in another group, which is likely to die within 15 years.
As long as this new work has not shown what the benefits of living for patients of surgery are, it is a security comfort for people under BMI 35, according to Blackstone.
This is also the most exciting part of the article, because there has been no increase in the risk of death or renal failure in a low BMI group.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin to take the matter seriously by falling to the BMI on 27th of July 30.
I think we've been waiting for people to take this matter seriously.
I think it's really hard to turn this into a version after we've collected these genetic changes that make their bodies weak and devilish.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama, who said that Europe could not afford a home for all of its citizens, added that the real solution to the current economic crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibet's leader, Buddhist leader, has been calling for the end of violence in the countries.
Dalai Lama changed from the beginning of a 10-day visit to England to the mythical crisis that Dali Lama was going to work on ethics at the opening of the Oxford Centre.
He suggested that under existing conditions, countries or countries should lay the foundation for mankind's exits.
At the same time, however determined, it was also pointed out that this situation was not enough for the countries of Western Europe to deal with the overwhelming crisis.
He said, "It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe."
As far as Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis were concerned, Dalai Lama asked that these were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to deal with a few thousand volunteers, but at the same time you need to think about long-term solutions; you need to think about how you can bring lasting unity to these Muslim countries, based on education and sustainable development."
We need to think about how we can reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
I've never solved problems with my use of power."
As regards the situation, Dalai Lama also changed after the 11th September attacks and asked that the U.S. forces had begun to arrest incidents that had not been controlled.
In my letter to President Bush after 11 June I addressed my main health requests, and I said that this problem had gone through non-violent procedures.
I know their powers are well meant, but he used his power and why the consequences were unexpected," Dalai Lama said.
In the last 4 years, there have been 4 times as many cases of hand disease seen in children.
The health control centres in the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 per cent in the high levels of alcohol in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to George Zehir Central Manager Dr. Gaylord Lopez, 12-year-olds who were reported to the Centre for Anti-Semitism in 2010 were from 3.266 to 16.117 in 2014.
Lopez said to CNN, "Children have shown more interest in this kind of product, and it's sad that there are hundreds of people between them who are going to get rid of it immediately."
Some kids said they knew their antiseptics and who did it in social media to influence their friends.
Videos on YouTube show antiseptic symptoms of low alcohol consumption.
It has been reported that some herbs have mixed their antiseptic compounds with oral water that contains alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Little children can get caught up in antiseptic tastes.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of those who are more attractive are those who are used to it.
There are the latest antiseptics of alcohol, fruit and portal flavourings, which are very popular for children.
Where the antiseptics are from, it's between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially for young children, it can only lead to a few frying with alcohol.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the Center for Disease Control at the University of Kansas, Kansa city of Fox 4 is "alcohol high there."
You can't leave a few habits in the middle of the whiskey bar, but people leave these antiseptics in the middle, and this is a very easy way to get too much alcohol for children.
In recent times, only four times as often as alcohol is used in school was quickly removed with the aim of seeing six-year-old Nhaijah Russell treatment.
It was two parts of the legal limit adopted by Dr. Chris Ritchey, a medical doctor at the Gwinnett Tüp Center outside Atlanta, where he was found.
Nhajaah can't call his words and can't walk when he comes to his emergency room.
According to Rithey, the doctors kept her under surveillance all night in a separate child hospital because she was caused by an alcoholic girl to fall and hit her head.
Anne Ortoria Scott said she was "very scared" when she explained to CNN.
He could have been a killer for my kid.
Lopez, grandparents and teachers recommended that they use alcohol-free products or take short contact with antiseptic ideas and remove children from places where they can't reach.
In addition to the use of alcohol, some antiseptics were found to be associated with death threats.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of an antidepressants containing an unexplained toxic substance.
Health authorities pointed out that the matter of speech is not alcohol, as indicated in the list, but that it could be methyl alcohol that can have a lethal effect.
In October, three third-class students from the north of New York prepared a complication with the "inventing anti-bacterial production around the class" in order to poison the "bad heart" teachers, according to police reports.
The teacher ordered that they be used as a class because they're allergic to antiseptics.
The plan presented by the police is intended as "a free coach" to provide discipline to the school administration.
You too go to Samandraa
Robin van Persie, who watched the game of the European League played by the Lokomotif Kuban of Fenerbahçe, finally came in contact with Udoh, Vesely and Melih.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with Udoh, who was a great man, "I came to watch you."

There were others who died, and also those who were wounded.
Who's guilty?
Of course.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's not the fat guy.
I'm afraid you're dead!
The killer's out there, he's holding his hand and looking at our face.
Some people are trying to turn their attention to other ways.
While the killer is in front of us, he creates opportunities for him to run away instead of signaling murder.
He's doing great with Katile.
He's hiding it.
After he's gone, he says he's actually innocent.
The sides of the war we've been living in the last 10 years are very clear.

In the dark, a voice that took us years ago...
Then it's open.
It's a woman who lives on the side of the window and jumps down.
Who's there and why he's up there, it's like he's been accused by his neighbors.
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
'Ebruysal', a popular writer, who was inspired by the Sea Cakr.
She's abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There's been things from childhood.

This interesting entrance is a different size than the entrance to the girl's house with the key of the container 'Murat' (Kadir Chermik).

Putin, he's calling you back.
Russia, in a situation where Turkey's services cannot be compared to another way, has made a statement to the Turkish companies that "can work with Russia", and the Russian Tur Operators Union "does not leave their Russian citizens from Turkey".
The Russian Economic State Authority, which calculated that the collapse of existing economic ties with Turkey would lead to an increase in the economy of Russia, has published a new "Issinian state" project on Turkey's government.
Even if I'm going into the area where Russia has to do according to the schedule published in the Federal Administration Directory, it's expected that Turkish companies and companies will be allowed to work with Russia.
It is estimated that it will be impossible to provide other sources outside Turkey or that local production in Russia will be able to generate and benefit from the production and services of Turkish companies and companies.
The karma Commission will identify which Turkish human property and service will be included in this category with other aspects of the Russian Economic Protection Supervisory Authority.
Thus, any Turkish company will be able to decide by choice by bureaucrats who can work with Russia.
According to the same document, it will be necessary to demonstrate to the Commission that private companies and state institutions in Russia are not capable of doing business with Turkish partners.
In the event of its entry into force by the Russian government, the tax will also be established in Russia by Turkish companies.
The Russian Tur Operators' Union, in a statement made yesterday, said that the Russians did not leave Turkey.
The statement was put in place: "In spite of the advice of the Russian Foreign Office not to go to Turkey, the sales law and the Russian Foreign Office began to search for a formula for organizing our fellow citizens' holidays on their own."

This trip seems impossible to carry out with the current situation."
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
Russia's State President Vladimir Putin reports that after the crash, economic developments will become more and more inexorable.
In those days, our employees who were trying to go to Russia, our THY staff, are officially knocking at the border door.
Turkey's assets are driven by wealth, based on control that won't come soon.
It's not much longer than a month ago, and it's a day since Moscow.
That's what I'm doing. It's a job.
So why?
You're so simple.
At a time when the economy is so global, you are no longer trying to turn the political barriers into economic war.
Look, we're still writing to Iran about how the economic embargo applied for years has gone wrong.
It looks like a friend like Russia and Turkey, but it's not much like it. It's a real threat to each other.
It's not technically possible to cut off these two countries from each other that night with a tourist partner and a customer.
If you close the door, these two countries will enter each other's country.

This must be discussed first, and Russia needs my help in this trap.

Dedicated accident: No inconsistencies in Celtic
Deila doesn't care about the words of nonconformity in Gryffith, Celtic.
The fight against Kalplerin, with Warburton's retreat from the warburton against the U.S.A.'s sanctions and the unity of the team against the attack by the SFA on Neilson
Leader Don's got his point of view on Celtic.
Adam Rooney's first half-pounded penthouse brought Aberdeen to Pittodrie to a treatise against Don against Hamilton, and gave Don a five-point distinction between himself and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about words of nonconformity
The statement made by the University of Celtic inconsistencies is echoed by Griffith's hand and shows that he and his teammates were not under any increased surveillance feeling when they were preparing to meet the Ligi Leaders in the Netherlands.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I'm in the corner where the players are impatient for it.
The fact that the Scots don't fight the unsub's life is a burden on Boer's life in the Netherlands.
Randers' former middle-level player and the Dutch football player Ronald de Boer, says they lost their interest in Celtic because of not having their football team rehabilitated with Rangers in the Netherlands.
De Boer, now an Ajax messenger, said, "They don't give the memories of Celtic games in the Netherlands anymore, why?"
Because Rangers isn't there anymore.
People don't just talk about turning Rangers back.
They're talking about the old team.
They're talking to teams when they're talking to each other, and they're interested in that.
Those who wanted to watch those games in the games of the old team were not just Scotch.
I'll fix things, Deila.
Ronny accepted Deila Celtic's struggle, but he said he was going to return to the Norwegian patronage.
The news against Malmö and then the Champagne champions followed the match that was lost to Aberdeen in the five-point table.
But Deila said, "Celtic has lived in the worst days, and we will return."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is so bad and so many people are angry or sad.
We're in the same situation, but we have to go on.
We really need Celtic's support because these games feel much better about themselves.
Now it's so important to stay together.
Warburton's Ocak Transfers Dr.
Just two weeks ago, despite the fact that some Ocak transfer targets had been identified, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton was afraid of signing, he insisted that Ibrox's team should not break up.
The ex-Brentford story told them: "The real transfer window is very different from the writing window."
For the players you wrote, there's a time before the season you're dealing with, and we've seen it in our own group.
The team's really fine.
Sometimes it's more harmful to add players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu in the field of business.
From Swansea's ruins, he contacted Celtic in the Michu transfer window and emptyed out the chances that he could be cured by the end of his conversation with the Dogs.
When he was 29 years old, he lived in a troubled leg pain and couldn't find a way to get out of Galler.
The hearts are ready for the SFA award on Neilson's terms.
When Paterson was fired from the game, the hearts were 2-1 before and then 3-2 lost, turned everything into the red card of the defense player -- the third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't give up on what he says, he's making a point: "I never asked for unity, I didn't make any progress on performances."
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The famous Hibee's old Hearts player, Rudi Skacel, was hurt when he said a song containing words that attacked him.
The event took place in March 2014 in Tynecastle, in front of Edinburgh, in a bar in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh.
"It was a train game and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can definitely say that after this, I'm not going to Tynecastle unless I play with Celtic.
Dundee United trusts the management of the Tannadic Foundation - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, the board of directors of the Dundee United States is still confident that the task will be corrected, but they agree that the outcome of the fall in the field should be final.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get kids ready to be put on the way back," Donnely said.
Welcome to the "crazy victory" against McLness Hamilton.
Derek Mclness admits that because of Adam Rooney's first half-pound pen, the Aberdeen team has found it necessary to stand up to Hamilton Accies in order to see the top seven hits of Celtic on top of the beer.
Mclnness said, "There's no team that won anything in the middle of it without winning the game."
As unemployment rates increased in England, there were similar rates between Scotland and England.
THE number of unemployed people in England has risen to 1.82 million during the May-Temmus period, while the number of unemployed in Scotland has not changed to 164,000.
According to the National Statistical Office (ONS), unemployment in Scotland is 5.9 percent higher than 5.5 percent in England.
In Scotland, 122,000 fell in the last three months, and the number of people who are currently working is 2612,000.
It's going to fall to 70.0 percent for Scotland -- this number is higher than 73.5 per cent in England.
State Secretary David Mundell, responsible for Iceland, said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's been almost a year since the history of Scotland decided to become part of England.
In the past 12 months, we have seen developments in the labour market in Scotland with the increase in demand and unemployment.
Why I am a Witness to a person in Oklahoma
I'm going to watch a man's death for a late legal lawyer in the hours ahead.
I don't hope so, but if I could, I'd sit in the hospital watching the death room in the state of Oklahoma Prison, where Richard Glossis was signed with a deadly injection.
He wanted me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The invitation was first made by his best friend in October, and I accepted whatever shock I had.
As that day drew near, I began to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted it because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
There'll be a perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor people in the United States, and because there is more application than any other place in the world, there is a terrible piango in the middle when it is decided who is to be chosen.
It's been five months since the Okkahoma media sitting there.
Whoever is chosen will follow his feelings without being touched.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the last few months and for a two-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We're very often laughing when we're talking.
The authorities in the prison told me that I would not be a witness or a journalist, and I will not be given a sentence or a leave so I can record what I have seen.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A law-reading journalist accused me of being undeterred on Twitter.
That's it.
Tell the judge's story as he likes it, get it.
I accused him.
And he admitted "you can bring it better" but he still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossy, what I say and write is not the same thing as me.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list when he wanted it.
But an international guest wants to be there and write them down.
If he dies, he thinks it'll help him face the death penalty.
A Huffington Post agent, Kim Bellware will be with me.
If you want more information about this, please listen to the podcast series I'm preparing.
I'm not gonna tell you all the details again.
I have no idea about Richard Glossip's innocence.
Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make himself a criminal partner.
But I still believe he's not guilty of his murder.
I believe there's enough evidence to justify a death penalty.
I think his character's wrong.
And I'll watch his death with this perspective.
I can't really say I'm being objective.
You can take care of the other passengers there.
I'll have the follow-up you'll get from me, from watching the death of a loved one who's accidentally killed.
After the arrest of the police, the man was confirmed by the Canning River.
Canning Vale police meme, he's been dead trying to convince him out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's behind the police car ended up trying to get him out of the car and in the hot water, by trying to convince him to return to the Nazi grave.
The Canning Valley Police were called on Saturday because they were not allowed to enter Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape from the police by entering the Canning River.
But it didn't go very far.
"The Chief Commissioner's assistant to the trader Castle, standing in his own water and saying, 'I'm not going out, 'Come get me'," he said.
The police Member Lachlan did not want to undermine the government's uniform and used a more secure tactic -- "good police spokesman."
"Sometimes people say funny things to try to escape," said Assistant Commissioner Castledin.
The champion footballer Ben Cousins provides an outstanding example in mind.
In 2006, Cousin left his car to escape alcohol control and went across the Swan Nehri.
The battle was unsuccessful, but the local people were inspired by the plans of Ben Cousin's biology.
Peter Moody claimed that the monkeys were spying on themselves and threatened to leave the race.
Peter Moody said that Racing Victoria's stories were trying to prepare a show last year and that he threatened to leave the competition immediately.
Racing Victoria took over the stories and the union department and said they were taking a personal campaign against Lady Tatai at their final contest on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the contests, and he told Lidari that he found himself in the forces he couldn't explain.
He said he didn't want to "be like nice flowers" for 18 months.
"I wouldn't say these things and I've been stuck on it for a long time, but sometimes you're very upset and everything's going to happen together," said Moody.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you're reacting, and you're going to join the results, and I'm going to join the results of what I'm saying.
When I go home tonight, I'll sleep quietly.
I want my head up and my bosses know I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking I haven't done this, it means I shouldn't be an executive anymore.
I thought what I'd do with my license.
Moody had previously bombed his department of unity in a rallying.com report, at the end of which he was accused of being in the spy room.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting with a man in a room -- I'll call him if asked -- and he was offered to work at my end for what I'm doing at the end of my life," said Moody, Racing.com.
They believe I'm a three-year-old.
If that's the case, they're all gonna have to take over the brakes because they weren't enough to catch me.
RVL's former president Robert Roulston, RVL's new president David Moodie and RVL's current general manager knew this, and now they know it.
Should this make me think it's starting to be personal?
Does RVL have a series of teams and maybe he wants to blame what's going on in the industry?
I'm so bad for the nurse?
I'm so bad for the enthusiast?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and get me out, but I'm not afraid of what I'm saying.
But at the moment I'm here, I don't care about anything, and I'm sorry.
This really hurts me.
I'll press on them, I'll charge them with the responsibility of making decisions.
I have my family's support and I'm going.
The long-term question of cobalt in the operator's Lidari has led to the idea of saying, "Put my license on the floor of the table."
In preparing for the upcoming campaign, Moody, who won the Moody Day, was appointed as a "dark" watch, and he said that it was contrary to the rules on the foot of the horse or horse.
This is contrary to the rules of competition.
I have to take over all of this."
One of my men accidentally hit his leg.
He could've taken the night.
He could've taken the rain. That's what happened.
It's been a day.
Moody, at the end of the interrogation of the managers, he may face three months' imprisonment for using the locker on the day of the trial.
It's a joke.
Those who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand that we need the rules, but this is a lot of progress," Moody said.
Caught command to run in Cobram
The police arrested the man who ran off a bicycle in Cobram last week.
The biker was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him in the Vadisi Autojole.
The police told him the driver who was shooting had escaped from the scene before he could help the victim.
On Tuesday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalia submitted to the police station in Shepparton.
It's expected to stop in an accident, help and blame for other traffic offences.
At 40 years of age, Cobram is still in a stable condition in a motorcycling hospital.
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy gave a strong answer to his ideas about how to deal with the problems of the crew.
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy appointed his team as a "probational" effort for NRL's two favorite priorities.
Sydney Roosters trainer Trent Robinson Cuma said that at the end of the half-night in Sydney, at the end of the game, Storm had allowed his own team of lawyers to "run" with his own team.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett's Saturday night on the North Queensland Cowboys won a semi-final match with the North Queensland Cowboys, which was designed as a "extraordinary" match for the game's Arab league, and said that the two Owensland was not "very big" in comparison.
He defended the fight of the Bellamy team and said they were focused on "themas" while fighting.
Bellamy said this was taking power from what came to the two previous team because it meant that Storm was worried about it.
This is happening -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson spoke on Wednesday, 24-2, and he said on Wednesday.
All year long, I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or in our techniques, but we've only made a real shot at our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and it's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and it's obvious that there's a big team he's been hunting, and he's probably not used to losing a little shock for himself.
It's funny it's been on the table this year.
Bellamy, who was against Bennett's idea of "renewing football", recalled Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons' priority by playing "hard" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football game.
On Saturday night, he made our Friday night match with his own games and how exciting their games were."
I remember St. George's being raped in 2010, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a fair girl.
But now there's a team to play football that we can call exciting football, and especially young people with speeds.
This is what you want to play when you're this type of player.
In 2010, he put this point, and now everyone wants to play football in this way -- each team has half of them, like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it's not possible to play in this way.
This gives me much more confidence because they're talking like this because they're a little scared of playing.
When they went to big games, they probably didn't bring us up six weeks ago.
Bellamy also indicated that Storm and Roosters had a higher score than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the school? 16-12?
Our game 20 - 18, we have both sides of our game more school, but is this the exciting football?
Or do you want to cut off your attacks but not make a scorer attack?
That's what I think every day is.
If they're talking about us, it means we're going to meet them here on a side.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulella Sharks won no end this week because he won the right to pregnancy in the AAMI Park on Saturday night.
The Srp Man was released for 200 thousand dollars in security because of his drug crime.
A man who was arrested on 40 kilograms of cocaine in Queensland and facing a potential death penalty was released for 200,000 dollars in security.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, was one of the five people who came from South America from the South American country of Vanuatu and who had been taken from the left-hand side of Coomare in August.
Maximovic met with his criminal partners at the sea during the morning meeting and later met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, which found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of meeting a potential negative penalty because of the presence of cocaine too much, he said that Maximovic's lawyer had no evidence that he had access to all drugs and that he could have a valid purpose.
Mr. Divan was concerned about the risk of a flight from Maximovic by Chief Governor Peter Flangan.
Serbia has open connections.
She travels to Serbia very often," she said, in the court on Wednesday.
He lied about where the police were staying in the camp.
Maximovic's mother and his stepfather offered 200,000 dollars to stay safe.
Judge Flangan said, "It is clear that every two people have read their pledges of $200,000 after they have read them. The security bill has actually created a financial burden on them."
However, he warned her that she was not enough to take her case.
Maximovic, Australia and Serbia's passports were issued free of charge and every day, and six-six-six-six-day travel laws were passed.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to force the pedophiles to show up
A pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for child IDs.
Steven Hogg, when he was sleeping on the girl's phone, offered him a series of inappropriate children sent to him by another user while I was sitting on a translator's text service.
She woke up later and realized that her phone wasn't there, and she found her phone in Hogg's hand.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before he warned his mother.
The police were interested and saw five images, then analyzed the computers in the address, and discovered "inflicted" Web calls made using terms to find inappropriate images of children.
Hogg later told the members that the reason for doing this was that he did it for "the management of pedophiles" on the Internet for "the fear of acting like a cop."
Mali's agent Elidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Justice: "It's an addiction -- it's a fear-related relationship.
He accepted calls from the computer but said he did it to scare the pedophiles to act like a police memory.
Questions were asked about interviews with people who did not know who sent their pictures to them, who wanted them to send more pictures than they did.
He said he did it to punish them.
When he was drinking, he said that he was exposed to ill thoughts and wanted to watch scenes of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When she found the messages on her phone, she cried out to her mother and cried and cried.
Mom saw inappropriate photos on the phone and then came after the charges.
She met the girl and said she used the computer and Playstation to look younger than she was.
Ward Road, 23-year-old Hogg, living in Dundee, found it guilty of taking or producing inappropriate pictures of children during the last 14th of July, this year on 25th of October and this year not being held in court on 24 March.
The defense lawyer Gregor Sim said that Hogg could argue that there was no "known sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael's case ended in October to be reported for social history.
Hogg was released safely in this case but he was kept in custody for other guards.
Sex crimes were recorded before the court history.
Robert Mugabe made a wrong speech in the parliament in Zimbabwe
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest head of Africa, fell from a podium at the beginning of this year.
It wasn't hurt, but the enemy's video went viral on social media.
Parliament's opening-up, the presidential debate, during Mr. Mugabe's speech, was confused by his ideas that he had taken the threat of unquenchable death from him.
The last month in Parliament, they were excited about the national vote they had taken, and they stopped talking regularly -- she repeated the same conversation on Saturday.
President Innocent Gonesse, leader of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), explained that seven speakers had come to the cell phone so they wouldn't bother themselves during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech has ended, he comes from a number that doesn't show the message to the journalists but he says, 'I'm sorry'," he said.
She says that her non-attachedness is correct in the Parliament and that she does not work for non-attachedness when she leaves Parliament.
The chief speaker said that Morgan Tsvangari "has been involved" in the threats to political leaders of the party.
Hewlett-Packard will complete 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will finish with 25,000 jobs in order to re-work and reduce expenses in organizational services.
HP will separate the two companies listed in this year's progress; computer and writing works will separate the company from the fastest growing companies and service operations.
A HP statement indicated that the fourth round of work expected would result in a margin of $2.7 billion.
Hewlett Packard said that the post-departure HP head and executive chief Meg Whitman, "will provide the new Hewlett Packard Company with more affordable and affordable services," he said.
"Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Company today will be less and more focused on HP than it is today and will be a large and deep portfolio for companies' new operating modes," he said.
As a separate company, we are far better than ever to meet the needs of our clients in the world.
According to a company statement, the annual income of the Hewlett Packard Company will be over $50 billion and "integrity-free technology solutions will be devoted to companies".
In the 1930s, Stanford University tables are divided into two companies called "The birthplace of Silicon Vadisi" in Palo Alto, where Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard are installed to make electrical equipment.
With a big reorganization to get mobile devices out of traditional personal computers.
This action of HP, one of the world's largest PC players and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is one of the latest events in the sector of belief that high-performance companies have shown better performances.
Arsenal Captain Michael Arteta says that his team friends are in trouble with the Dinamo Zagreb before the game.
Wenger pointed out that Wilsher's silence was in July and that his treatment was planned, that he had no reason not to play in Christmas.
The best scenario already means that at least four games in England will be completely lost and you know that when you look at the past, you will not appear to be participating in the future European Championship.
The last part of the problem is that Wilsher's most embarrassing side of the problem is that it's over the past season after a different footing of Willsher and then it's over.
This guy's not a threat to a long career, Wenger said.
It's not a perfectly good shirt.
It's not big.
It was just a disaster.
It has nothing to do with the sciences or the past silences.
According to a medical perspective, these may be correct, but there is a risk that Wenger will be more likely to become involved in the middle of the season, as Wenger will admit.
At the same time, there's an unsatisfied stay.
According to a study by the Premier Creations Ltd, there have been 23 different disturbances that were recorded since the beginning of the six years since Wilsher.
In the last five seasons, Arsenal's 157 league game was only 65.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of the two First League teams that have been lost since 2007-08 since this eight-year period.
Wenger accepts a short turn of potential, but Arsenal believes that there will be a improvement in the long term.
"Sometimes you live in an open time during your return from an hour, it's a time you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack's as young as he can stand under it.
I hope his body is stable, I trust it, and I believe he will do what he deserves.
The champions have to play Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur games on Wednesday night before Arsenal, which will start in front of Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday, and he will play Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow, preparing the Hungarian team for it.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia. This means that Matthew Debuchy will play Art.
Wenger can start with the Nacho Montreal instead of Theo Walcott with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
"I'm trying to find a solution that we need to protect the sea and play," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a member of the F Group's open-ended favorites, he is located among the most dreaded stadiums of the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb in Europe.
The last season in the dynamic is not 41 games after producing its own "Funny" campaign.
According to Richter's size at the stadium Saturday night, he was crushed by a depression of 3.2 violence.
This is the 10th anniversary of the quake in Zagreb.
Wenger Arsenal's last season of champions believes he has received the necessary training against Monaco's League of Champions, and it prevents him from being motivated with a long-term goal to bring the first European Cup victory to the club.
"This motivation goes on," says Wenger.
It wasn't like that in Arsenal.
We're very close in 2006, but I've got the experience of being real on the other side.
We're stuck, but we're not amazing.
FriendsFest: A comedian program that gives us serious lessons about friendships between men
It highlights the absence of similar portals in programmes, especially in a time when there is a 15-year-old gathering of young men who feel more needed to open up.
This was the biggest cause of deaths among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in 2013 and more than three times in men than in women.
To address this problem, Sefil Life Fight Campaign (CALM) launched 2015 as a Men's Year and aims to confront a culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
There is a friendship in the centre of the struggle to fulfill this difficult task.
A study among more than 2,000 depressive school students showing symptoms showed that there are two sides of the chance of improvement if a person with a high incidence of depression has a "normal fashion" friend.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, it brings about the physical difficulties that can arise from healthy friends.
But, of course, friendship needs to be available before it can work.
At this time, social media is a heavy communication; it makes it more urgent to communicate rather than meaningful communication in the living room, including in the living room.
Our digital life, our strong, fun, and the need to look like successful people -- even if everything is really the beginning of isolation.
These include those who claim that money, prestige, and social status are beyond the reach of successful psychologists; these include the internal values that have a deeper impact on our mental health — our personal development and our internal need for friendship.
As the Creator of a billion video games explained recently, money will no longer buy much happiness.
The beauty of the friend's order was to turn this room point down.
It was not by his actions but by his personality; it was also by his dealings with his friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent beatings, the minutes they were watching football in the Confortory Chambers, all the men's feelings about explaining exactly how they're doing to Ross's relationship with Rachel were actually coming back from knowing how they could handle these things.
"I've seen how the smallest interaction between my friends can make a difference when I hear people who are depressed and infatuated."
They don't talk to most of the men who've been in touch with us.
A feeling like going out is very powerful, and that's how it's a sign of weakness to talk to others."
It's one of the programs I've been thinking about when I've proposed long-term recovery mechanisms.
He's been shot at by the little moments of his boyfriend's friendship.
My goal is to make sure that a foreign status on the phone helps people when they are in a difficult situation, but long-term support comes from family and friends who are close to their personal networks.
And if you join the FriendsFest of Comedy Central this weekend, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment where the scenes are redesigned to celebrate?
Or, better, if you only see someone at Starbucks, smile and say hi.
You don't know how your friendship will make a difference.

Di Maria's goll made it easier for PSG to heal Malmö.
Angel Di Maria congratulated Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his defeat of Malmö.
Angel Di Maria, at the beginning of the Champions League, made it easier for the Swedish team on Saturday to pass over the PSG's name to Malmö.
Here's the game reports and the game reviews.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani started with a 2-0 last-rate and clean gylindrical match against Malmö on Saturday in the city of Parc des Princes, Paris Saint-Germain.
Di Maria was a PSG player who won the French Championships in the League before four more minutes, but at 61 minutes they couldn't appreciate Cavani's second hand.
A Group of Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk needed a strong start against the Swiss Championship in Paris, and they needed it not only to get out of action groups, but also to ensure that the final performances of the final cycle of the last three seminars were improved.
But the game they were playing when they took points was not the best game for Laurent Blanc's team, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of space on the penal scene, and he was later transferred to the state team that started his prominent career with him in 1999.
"It's not easy to get out of the league champions, it's not easy to get out of it, it's going to create problems for our fans, and there's some things we need to improve within the season, but it's a good start to give a calm appearance again," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and win, even though we didn't throw one or two arms anymore.
Abrahamovic returned to the Paris team at the end of the week with a 2-2 player who was playing with Bordeaux at Lig 1 but was in the shadow of Di Maria at the fourth minute.
When the Argentine flag player was transferred from Manchester United last month, he viewed PSG as a higher-level player in Europe, and Marco Veratti showed that such thoughts were wrong when he ran behind Malmö's defense and sent Johan Wilde away with a good fight to the files from far away.
With this, everyone was disappointed, waiting for PSG to win a big fortune.
To pass this game, Malmö went down to the stadium with nine international players, who played Celtic on the play off, and had two players in the middle of a five-and-a-a-half field, a heavy replication.
At 34 minutes, Nikola Djurdjic was attacked by Kevin Trapp except for a few attacks.
On the other hand, the PSG gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passports and the latest attacks, and Ibrahimovic failed to perform at least five attacks on the first half, and caused Cavani to lose his mind without sleeping.
He showed that he was superior when he came to organize his colleagues, and at 52 minutes, Di Maria was Abrahamovic, who was behind the fake war that he sent to Willan's castle.
After a full hour, the second round came through Cavani, and the Uruguayan player, after Ibrahimovic, recorded his sixth hand in the middle of Maxwell's left leg.
After the thought of Malmö's coming back and after the game, after which Ezequiel Lavezzi, who was not supposed to be behind the back of the show, was completely healed by Willand, David Luiz, and did not allow him to change his course.
Later, Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG was superior to his team, and Norvechli said, "Our final champions were in the middle of the last year."
From that history, we've only played together at the Swedish League, which is not at the same level.
The teams in the arm aren't enough.
He's being pulled out of Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore got $2.5 billion from his emotional sales.
The Swiss-centred mining debt, Glencore, had been paid off from his lost assets and bought $2.5 billion on Sundays, including his debt-sharing plan.
Glencore, listed in London, explained that he sold a new feeling at 1.6 billion Sterlin to pay his debt.
This year, a company that lost 57 percent of its market value, was deeply affected by its prices due to the rise in Chinese demand for economic slowdown and market interference.
The issue of the right was why Glencore's emotional costs were raised at London bus in early Sunday morning.
In FTSE 100, Hesseli fell to 131.60 pens by 2.77 degrees.
Last week, Glencore revealed a $30 billion debt collection, which was part of a $2.5 billion sales plan, which was part of a three-to-one reduction plan.
The company sold its new years to 125 pens, and this number was 2.4 percent discounted on Friday's cover.
The group sold $1.3 billion, equivalent to 9.99.
Concerns about China's long-term increase in the price of iron steel are falling by half; copper, copper and other materials fell between 20 and 40 percent.
White Saray Xi Jinping verified Washington's Visit
In his statement on Saturday, White Saray confirmed that China's President Xi Jinping would be present at an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The statement indicates that Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and that a visit to Barack Obama came to Beijing last November.
After the second meeting of the two presidents of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama, Peng Lijuan's wife and Xi will have dinner.
In addition, the statement "The visit of President Xi will increase the cooperation of the United States and China on regional and global issues along the lines of the two countries of the visit to Bashkan Xi and will enable President Obama to address the issues that have not been agreed upon in a constructive way".
The visit, which was first opened in February, is expected by Xi to meet some U.S. technology leaders before visiting Washington, New York, and then by joining the BM General Body to be held in July.
Obama and Xi are expected to take into account some of the controversial concerns of Washington about China's cyber-sex activities, and some of the issues that China finds in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon seems to care about the variety in film production
Matt Damon, when he said that it wasn't necessary to be in the back of the camera during an interracial argument, came out against the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown.
In the project Greenlight Pazar night section, published at HBO, the project called on an experimental actor to point out that the Brown project's selection scenario requires a black-main alternative look-in.
Damon, when we're talking about different kinds of things, you're not in the player's frame of show, you're in the movie player's frame, you're in the idea.
Brown, who's shocked, showed his reactions to such expressions as "Oh, okay," as Marsley's actor continued.
The co-workers on the finalists of the Damon and Brown show were brought together by Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers.
Brown once said, "I wanted to show people how they would behave, no matter who is in charge."
One black character shot by a white chat room.
The famous White People wanted Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to be the editor of the film's rights, and the finalists wanted him, and Damon announced their tasks "in a way that could not be achieved."
After the debate was published, there was a wave of hostility in the social media against Damon's condition.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at cutting off "Matt Damon's speech about the only black person in the room can explain the diversity of this person as a pain to BEYAZ ISE."
After the tweet was sent, he got 5,000 retweet and 4,000 fans.
Damon's condition came when he was in the front line of social disputes in the field.
After a young white police memory named Michael Brown was killed in 2014, the Black Life movement was moved to end its application against lawmakers and colourful people.
On Saturday morning, the singer Prince spoke in a closed manner about the movement when the annual album was announced in Grammy's Awards.
The albums are still important, he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Life Action published a report on the question of whether Elizabeth Hasselbeck's group, an important character in Fox News, should not be considered as a hate group.
Leaders, Black Life is important. The network is a love group.
In the past it was announced that Damon was included in the list of artists, artists and media patrons who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the recognition of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if he hasn't accepted the invitation or if he hasn't met Papa yet.
"American Ninja Warrior" race to the first championship
The professional stone miner and co-commist Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warner's program on Friday night.
In the seventh season, this competition has never seen a complete competition in the barrier party.
At the end of the season, Caldiero and Geoff Britten were able to stay in the final stage.
The last mission was to climb a 20-foot bridge in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first person to finish this race and so he managed to be the first athlete to complete the 4th season of the American Ninja War; but Caldiero was able to finish it three seconds ago.
After this brutal disaster, Caldiero spoke to E!News about the shock of winning a $1 million prize.
Isaac, E!, told him a big deal about his money, saying, "I think it's great to think about it, I won over $10,000 a year or I've never been through."
So I can't even imagine what it'll be like once... it won't be known.
The manufacturer Kent Weed de The Hollywood Reporter finally met and explained why no compensation would be paid even though it was the first competitor to finish the British press.
According to the rules, money is given as fast as possible.
Weed said, "If it's over, it's going to win the fastest reward."
Though money is a great reward and a change of life, it has earned a great deal.
I don't think it's a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He was so impressed by their surprises that he took a few tons of credit.
A great man and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "I'm happy to be Isaac if somebody wants to eat me."
I think that if he had changed his roles, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
The American Ninja War has renewed the agreement for the eighth season, and the attacks will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers through Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- the second half of the season wasn't very surprising for Detroit Tigers.
At one time, Tigers, one of the best baseball players, is currently taking place during the last time of the Central American League.
Tigers, who brings the game into disrepute, was able to play Minnesota Twins on 5-4 a.m. on the day of the line.
The Twins lost the chance of raising the second U.S. Ligi prison card in mid-point between Houston Astros.
And for Detroit, even at one point in the middle of the second half of the season, he was going back to a good game that wasn't very much seen.
The manager of Tigers, with Brad Ausmus' statement, "No matter how bad things are."
The Tigers team shooter Alfredo Simon was able to pick up one in the sixth and ninth shots by showing support for Detroit's first three times in the first two wars.
Simon (13-9) has been shot in 3/1 rounds, three of which have been shot.
This was only the third quality of the last nine.
"I just want to close your year," said Simon.
It's hard for the hostages to play any game free, so I wanted to get him into the game too.
Tigers' elected shooter, Victor Martinez, has made three attacks, and both escaped that it was the first RBI he won since Augustos.
This was the first three night of the four attacks that Martinez won against Seattle Mariners in six weeks.
"He's stuck his ass," said Ausmus.
It looked good (in the shooting training) and it was better in the way I looked at BP than it was in the game.
At the end of the seventh battle, Twins, who captured three escape rights, took the best chance to re-enter the game.
The middle stage player, Byron Buxton, started a two-way fight on the left.
Right-hand player Aaron Hicks could only make a slow fight, and Simon took Brian Dozier's second shot before he took up the fight for Blaine Hardy.
Mauer, two - the right-hand player in the race, Drew VerHagen, went ahead with the only player that could win against Miguel Sano.
On the second round, VerHagen was able to pull Trevor Plouffe into the second game with a pair of runners.
Plouffe's attack on DP was 27 times the big deal.
After meeting to guarantee Detroit's 9th run, Mauer passed the RBI and opened up between Tigers and Bruce Rondon, making 5-4.
Along with this, he was arrested at three fires in Sano to save five lives.
Detroit lost his form with Phil Hughes' early departure.
The Tigers won three shots in their first two shots against the new right-hand five players who had been away from the fields for over a month because of the burning of the order.
"This isn't the game I wanted to play clearly," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable in the future and I was able to do very good exercises in the third shots."
Hushes took Ian Kinsler out of the game when he took a successful shot first.
Right-hand player J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone on his first run.
Victor Martinez competed with the racers to cross the 0-21 band in the number line.
Third hunter Nick Castellanos watched the right one shot and won another flight, but Victor Martinez was shot while he was trying to do the third one, so the threats ended.
The Tigers made a second addition, they made a three-to-a-a-half-a-half-year-old player from the catcher James McCann and Anthony Gose.
Twin's manager Paul Molitor said "a great fight."
He didn't shoot very well, but he threw it right on the ground.
Hughes, who was shooting, did three shots that didn't bring up the number until it changed with A.J. Backer.
Hughes was charged with three escapes in six wars and four indiscriminate attacks.
Nottlar: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez is out of play because of the pain in his brain that he used to shoot.
In 2007, Sanchez will be interviewed by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery.
It's been planned that Sanchez, who has been on his watch list since mid-August, will start working on Wednesday.
In the case of Sanchez, LHP Daniel Norris will start with DL against Twins.
The four other games that David Price moved in 30th of December are in the case of Tigers 1-1 with Norris.
20 August has not been due to the pain on the right.
Tigers and Twins will finish their three game series on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open up more to the world.
On Saturday, a group responsible for managing the reforms said that the economy should be more open outside in order to speed up the enlargement of President Xi Jinping.
To strengthen General Reforms, the President said in his 16th meeting, "China must develop open policies with foreign investment skills."
Xi said when he promised to open up, he said that making new reforms would create a new area for economic growth by bringing new energy and life.
The Group of Leaders would have been a series of initiatives such as a negative list of market access, cross-border control policies, the promotion of participation in state-owned entities (SOEs) and the monitoring of local registration systems.
According to the report, a list of legal sectors and non-profits for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be tested at a low level and will be developed using test programs.
This important factor will play a greater role in identifying the sources of the market for iron and will make the market more transparent by providing the legal basis for the business environment.
At the same time, the government will ensure that companies carry out their own business by exercising control over companies.
This statement also indicates that the new cross-border economic cooperation models in the border areas of China will be monitored and new mechanisms will be introduced to promote regional growth.
There will be a much more extensive private sleep to open up the sectors controlled by the state.
The statement said, "The government will not change the management policy for foreign investment, and the foreign finance companies will be better served by protecting the interests of foreign companies,"
In addition, it will facilitate the regular placement of foreigners or the acquisition of "green cards" by way of optimising and implementing procedures.
The Court also held a meeting on the protection of the rights of judges to practice and the development of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an explanation published after the meeting, President Li Keqiang and prominent leaders joined Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
The Minatar Cart is now a multi-mode-Time newspaper with two
In the fashion world, roads are turning around and coming back to tents.
I mean, the last time I've been out of my mind, the ones who've been mined...
You can also tell the adults that the little bags connected with them are also being taken care of.
They say that everything's very small.
I think it's fair for the bags.
As soon as he couldn't move his pants and chains on his bosses, the wind began to flow out of his way, and he wanted the bags to be reduced.
There were small bags already, but this time they came up against us with reduced levels of large hand bags.
These tiny bags can only cover your phone, credit card and key.
I started with Céline and Hermes, published with Prada.
The turning of the Chanta's beauty into a mineral interest has also been the result of new models.
Loewe, this season's fun bags are packed with two rounds.
The Panda, the box moon, and the file form are the most beautiful ones.
It looks like the most redstairs of the size of the large bags that are filled with phenomen's names are still the redstairs.
Hermes, Jane Birkin's most preferred "Birkin" bag.
Lieutenant Jane Birkin said he didn't want his name to be understood by the press, but we're still doing this in memory.
The fashion weeks gave me a break in my bag.
And in the podiums, my bags are coming out.
It's not possible to hold them in your arm because they're too thin.
They can be used with their long arms, with their prints.
But in the podiums, we've seen a lot more of those long arms, and they're back on the billboards of models.
I'm a fan of those who've taken my bag issue to one point.
There's a point for those who don't put me in the bag but those who don't give up.
They're my friends in big bags.
How?
We're turning the mini bags into one that can be connected to the sizes.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let's see what else we'll see!
The profound change in religion
Turkey is in the process of dealing with the world's brands.
This experience I've gained in my life is now enriched by my design.
Loft's one of them.
We've seen some black models that used to start taking place in each season.
When the blacks were so high they found their closest friend.
Deep pieces and detailed designs are important as a friend of the religions.
In general, short model models called "motorbike" in the day.
And when the powerful air of the brain is finished, the black pieces are still finished; the long-distance blues, the sprayed sweaters provide a bright view of the sport.
Young people used to say they wanted to lose their clothes and their stock.
He was supposed to save the day.
Now, young people want to move a piece of wood into the cold as long as it's safe.
From this point on, you can say that Loft has correctly understood the target kit with the collection and complete pieces.
Small step for banking, global
The World Prize for the Collection The Art of Banksy, which brought together the treasures of the Secret Road artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
It's the first history of the Global Karakóy building that has been built for 15 years and the first time in 85 original series.
The first day of the history of Bansky's secret street artist in Istanbul was opened at Global Karakowy.
Of course, there was no famous artist in the world who hid his identity and used his master's name.
And we don't know he's not coming to Istanbul.
But according to surgeon Steve Lazaridas, Bansky is not even aware of this.
There's no situation where he needs his permission.
Because the way of the old friend Bansky and Lazaridas has been separated after 12 years.
Some of the collection was collected by the collectors of Lazaridas and some of them.
But there are things that Bansky's followers are interested in.
What did Banksy think about the history of The Art of Banksy, which was brought to a close of 85?
How did they react to the introduction of a serial ticket (35 TL)? What if they saw a small store that was built at the end of the 800 square meters of glass?
Does it sound like the red balloon girl, the cleaning woman, who's been looking at things that are so bad in the world like now?
A history of an anarchist spirit-concealed artist who conceals his identity is so admiring to the Banksy followers.
It's no way of Banksy.
But you can still get your limited number tickets before you break them!
The great story for the little, global world for the Banksy can be seen until Nisan.
These are the people who are weak and unjust.
If they leave, they'll be punished.
President Recep Tayyyyip Erdoğan has taken the view of the academies who signed the notice.
Those who were arrogant will say, "It is they who are the wrongdoers. They are the ones who are the lowest."
Those who are with the wrong-doers are the wrong-doers.
He said, “They are guilty of the same sin, because they are with those who commit it.”
Recep Tayyyip Erdoğan, who succeeded in the explosion in Sultanahmet, said, "In this action in the Sultanahmet area, which is a common area of history and culture, I have to apologize to the German Prime Minister for the death of our ten German friends in such a region and to the German Chancellor.
And I want to inform all Germans of my requests to the families of those who have died before."
He said, "Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination."
Erdoğan, who deals with the academies who sign the information, said: "I stand up against all these terrorist events and publish a piece of information, and I am particularly sorry for those academies who signed it under those catholics, and I am very violent."
It doesn't make anyone know who our country is much closer to, so in front of you, Professor, it doesn't make anyone know who it is.
These are the men of discernment.
It is they who are the unjust, and it is they who are the weak.
And they did the same thing because they were with those who did the same thing.
So where will those three-year-olds who are in China with their father put up with these three-year-olds?
How do these promote their consciences to take place near his executioners?
I invite you to take care of all the court cases, the university's Senate, and our laws.
I told you yesterday that the steps that should be taken should be postponed over time.
Let them go what they will do there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in Parliament.
But if they can't do it in Parliament, they'll go to jail or go to the mountains.
I'm so open and clear.

Celine Dion lost her wife
In Canada, the original singer Celine Dion's wife, René Angelil, lost her life.

Mte Gümürhan's second documentary "Gench Pehlivans", 66.
The first Turkish documentary selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February).
He's a real executive, but he's a company in the Netherlands, and he's told me why and how he's done his drawings in 2014.
The "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival will be the "Generation Kplus" document describing the story of the six-year-old Amassian school student who aims to become a world champion in the south.
One of the names of the young Pehlavans, the first documentary of Turkey's selection in this section, is that of the Crystal Moon.
Despite its birth in the Netherlands, it's actually an executive director, Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a child, he listened to and watched the passengers.
"There's only political issues in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anadolu.
"For example, it's sad that Dad doesn't know much about our sports." He wants to come up with six managers and prepare a documentary project.
This project will be endless, but one day the news on the plane will open another project door to Gümurhan.
'We're stuck in the sugar factory.'
A 10-to-11-year-old girl named Mete Gümürhan, who has written about two small brothers, goes to Samsun, whose family lives.
The children's father won't let him get a warrant.
"I've been thinking about what I can do all day.
Because support could be withdrawn from the Cultural Watch."
Dad was talking about a sleep school in Amaziah where children go to see me.
I thought I'd go there.
I met 26 kids who were interested in sex at school when I was raising two children.
In a week, we started getting them ready and we're done with them.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We slept in the bedroom of the sugar factory."
The most difficult language that has been conducted in three weeks has been the most difficult language that has ever been conducted by the document.
"I don't know what I'm going to meet when I'm driving."
"They didn't know Turkish," she says.
Young Pehlavans are focusing on the story of 26 children from the same age group.
Baran, who is raised by the sea and who lives on the kilo, Aaron, who is not involved in training for breaking his arm, Beitullah, the school's favorite child, Umit, the smallest champion Ahmet and the group...
Mete Gümurhan tells us he's working with the children, "I left them completely."
I was just trying to use Muhammad everywhere.
I've been driving for the first week of training.
I wanted the kids to act like they didn't have any cameras.
"Whatever they've done, they've gone fast."
It was a surprise to be elected to Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan, who said that the young Pehlivants didn't expect to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival, said, "We were ready, but we were surprised to be elected to Berlin."
Young Pehlavans aren't a sport documentary, but I'm doing something to get rid of their children's struggles and get rid of their lives.
He says, "I wanted to plan ahead for the children who have family problems to find out who they are and what they can do with their problems."
Support for academics from around the world
Following the announcement of the "Academics of the United Nations Initiative" of the "Academies of the United Nations" on the morning of the day, they come to their post-post-post-up statements to investigate the academics and take care of them.
The first support came from a number of authors whose name was widely known.
The filmers of the past day, and today, the theaters have explained their support.
In a statement signed with the signature of the 138th theater, "We declare that we are at this honorary meeting of the academics who have been called upon as artists in the fields of theatre and art and art, and that we are at the same time with freedom, equality, the right to life and the unanimity."
It was said, "We're singing our voices and our whole heart to the lecturers and to the call of the academics."
Among them are the Turkic Sea, Atilla Ozdemir, Nadir Srübbeb, Self Alper, Serra Do Not Walk, Honor, Ethim Master, Pelin Esmer, and Tolga Karachilik, and more than 400 cinematographers "We are with freedom of thought and art.
But if you say, "We shall not be partners in this sin,"
"We are with the Institute of the Peace Academy," he supported the academics.
And the filmwriters' Level (SYAD) commented, "We are with the academics who have been brought to the target of the Linch campaign."
The Initiative of the Peoples of the World Peace Academy, which was launched on 11 October, published a headline entitled "We Are Not Sharers in This Crime," in agreement with the joint statements made in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 October.
With the order and books of the 1128 academics of the 89th University of Ttne, Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, and Etienne Balibar, they also signed.
President Erdoğan and President Davidato, however, strongly called on Erdoğan to "do the job" to organize the organizations by calling for the announcement of the academics to be "terrorist" in a "terrorist" manner.
After this call, some universities were beginning to question the prosecutor's office.
He was taken to a large number of colleges last night.
I'm surprised, please help!
The red hair of Sultan's honor, the Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
Although it's considered normal to work in a place like those, it's considered psychological discomfort after the point where life begins to affect itself.
'Celebrity warship syndrome', the name's another 'farety worship syndrome', which has become academia in the world already, and we've been talking about something new.
It can be considered normal to run into the cave halls with the famous photos of the ladies.
But remember the 'Hurm Sultan' age that all the dawns are walking with hot hair in Ireland.
We've already learned that "Beren burnu" is the beginning of the 2015 aesthetic surgery that we left behind.
It's not very different with the gentlemen.
Once it was a custom to dress like Polat German.
Now, it's completely different. It's going to be the middle.
Justin Bieber's copy of the case, we're surrounded by a stone.
And he read on the Internet thousands of times as much as he did when he said, "Listen to your bones when you are like this first, and place them over your heads."
Only the sides will be short.
After the cut is done, you need to give your hair a little bit of water.
Set your hair with spree after the drawing process has finished.
"Justin needs to be trained to get hair."
All of this, which has already become academia in the world, makes it clear that we are the new-mentioned 'Celebrity Warship Syndrome', another 'Glorious Worship' syndrome.
The fans of the fans look like we're falling in love.
The artists stand up with their amazing numbers and the extent to which they are affected.
Whatever the psychological situation is so simple.
It's a matter of deciding what to eat, what to listen to, what to wear, what to wear.
The name that is used for unreachable service is identified as an overcrowded, role-taking model spiritual discomfort.
The Uzman Psychologist Demir admits that Turkey has been back in its work in this area.
But it doesn't ignore the fact that family knowledge is slow: "One of the basic issues of psychology is that one agrees with one's own, that one's identity is quiet."
First, it was not taken seriously to fill the children's room with bags, someone's daughter.
It's changing now.
He feels like he's gonna have to take a stand.
"It's a sign that something in your youth's life has gone wrong."
Fans of sensory early training
It's safe not to run away from the crowd.
Demir suggests not wanting to get married, to be jealous of his wife, to give attention to her guests like to prefer her dress.
We're talking about people who are famous for their name.
It's normal to be interested in them, to be involved with their lives.
But most of the young people who have lost the ball of the canal in the canal of the sciences say, "I don't care about the family or the child around, but when there are no names that represent the point of good behavior, it's full of guilt."
Not always good examples.
"And he's copying his shortcomings, boy."
When we tell them how we'll get close to them, Demir starts by reminding them that the syndrome is more difficult to detect.
The problem becomes more calm when it comes to the fact that the dawns can be insecure.
And when they grieve for what their families have left behind, We defend them and treat them with kindness, [saying], "Indeed, we are not going to find out their secret ideas."
New research suggests that changes in the brain are being made because of changes in the brain.
"The connection between a young man who is in high-speed train must also be natural and mild. "
It's possible to change behavior
Suzman Psychologist Demir reminds us of his duties to overcome the syndrome of worship:
Know his emotional pain, make sure you're calm before he gets into trouble.
Don't ever let him suppress his feelings.
You showed him that you respect his miracle to reassure independence.
Set a good example by teaching rather than overdrinking, and discuss with him names that will be a role model.
Try to take the place of the speakers in our daily lives together.
It will be helpful to read together the books that explain the truth to those who praise God.
Convert your communication to a mature adults.
Do not forget that addiction and motivation are used the same ways in your brain.
Share with your child the opportunity to change mistakes and accept them as it is.
Get some scientific support for your work.
The one who is sealed, and the stoned, feels a terror.
There's a need for medic hope and help on the basis of the syndrome.
Love that doesn't stop, it's actually a call for help.
But I'm sorry it doesn't work out that way.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to restrict one country or another.
Dr. Recai Jahyao, notes that there are certain names that are involved in television all over the country.
The syndrome shows itself in connection with these fames: "They're out of line."
Most people don't have their options.
As for those who have power, they will not be like them.
Or because they're not mine or they're not disappointed.
Those who do not have the means to do so will be able to see with their own eyes those who do not live like them.
There's no difference between those who dig or watch as much as they can.
They both smell wonder inside.
They earn money without work, they're on the magazine's day.
Even knowing this is enough to increase your chances.
Another suggestion of Demir is to ask about the reality of those lives at this point.
You must not ignore the fact that the Sunni is the word of life.
The support of the person who has been honored goes around here.
But the man's pride leads him to admit that he's like his own pain.

Dr. Fevzi Self-defense answers the questions in the Mayan newspaper.
There's a stone on my trip, and every morning when I get up, I go to the bathroom with my wife's pain after meals twice or more a day.
Could that stop me from giving me a kilo?
I've started using alcohol right now, but I don't want to eat, I don't give a kilo.
That's what I've been doing since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
You think I'm supposed to be an operation?
CEVAP: A infection usually results in a similar infection to that carried by the Safara.
It is a sign that when you eat the pain of this woman who has grown up soon after your meal, you may find that you are free from the discomforts of the journey.
If you're in trouble because of a long journey, you're trying to get out of here.
That's why you're going to the bathroom often.
And because you're going out in a tough tub, it's getting your food fired off and it's slow to give you a kilo.
I think you need to fix this situation.
If you're going to a gastro enterologist and you're diagnosed with what I'm saying, you can get rid of it using antibiotics.
But at the end of the trip, you may also have to be on the mission.
The probosciscals can't slow down your complaints, but they can't.
Whatever it is, I say, continue to use the probation.
Because the biggest help to your weakness is this probiotic dust.
I'm eating a lot of food when I'm stressed out.
I give myself food when I'm stressed and tired, and I take a kilo.
How can I do this?
CEVAP: The excessive demand for food actually means that the energy needs are not fully met.
It could be a little food or a little breakfast and lunch.
Another reason is that you don't have to bite your teeth.
To do this, your system needs to work well.
If you're tired, reflect or have a problem like this or use a good probiotic medicine as easy as possible.
You'll see more of it.
I can't wait. I don't know why doctors don't know.
You have information that usually tends to be weak.
It's all very meaningful for me, but I'm a little different.
I can't take a couple of pounds.
I don't know why.
He's saying something to the doctors.
CEVAP: The techniques we use are not just about to weaken the body's physiological work, turning it back into ideal sizes.
Weakness and weakness are the same kinds of discomfort.
It's the same technique that we're dealing with not being able to take a kilo in the winter.
And you are weaker when you eat of the fruit of the date-palm and grapes.
I think you've already understood that.
You can also be warned with carbon dioxide and take kilograms without a healthy intake.
I mean, you've been getting away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have been getting away from their ideal bodies.
You'll reach your ideal body by kilograms, and they'll get by kilograms.
If you remove the system problem from the center, you take kilos, they'll give you kilos.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

A child throws himself into a 'freat' from a worthless sense of self
There are some feelings that come from the world of human emotions.
Fear, regret, happiness, surprise, forgiveness, anxiety...
But hate, anger, feelings like resentment are at the root of childhood and some wrong attitudes.
Everyone needs to know how to be a fool.
I mean, you respect the decisions of the public or the social environment, you ask yourself questions and you feel it's worth it.
It creates the basis for a healthy person to be made.
For example, in matters where a child is concerned, it means that he does not respect his child’s character (to dress or to eat), that he or she does not care about his wishes and that he does not have his rights (to send him to an instrument course that wants him to go to football).
Because a child who does not respect his identity and his existence loses his freedom of self-defense, the defense mechanism makes him feel guilty and hate to protect him.
"Because it's really the opposite of being angry and hateful," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that he doesn't accept what is done to him and that he's worth it and he's trying to tell him about himself and his environment.
A scientist who doesn't accept the child's status and then says that his attitude is a significant development in personality development, "The hate here means 'I am here', it serves to protect the child's self-esteem."
He says, "If you're allowed to have a child, you'll get rid of your hatred."
The child tries to protect his identity by avoiding anger and hatred
Arslan, who says that in the younger age, and in the most vulnerable times of the physical and spiritual nature, children's ancestors, who are left out of existence in verbal and emotional violence around them, will probably live to feel that their existence is unknown and invisible to children.
Arslan goes on to say: "This can sometimes be in a way that is not only sensitive to the needs (not to love, not to kiss, not to be interested in school or other needs), but also that of the physical needs (e.g. food, drink, shelter, school needs, etc.) at times."
It's a development that opens the door to hatred.
But in emotional and verbal violence there are acts of humiliation, contempt, neglect, torture, unnecessary and heavy punishment, feelings of worthlessness and pride.
These behaviors touch a child’s personality deeply.
"The child or the child will lose his respect for what he has heard, and will spend his life with a sense of self-esteem, self-esteem and lack of love, or seek to protect his identity through forgiveness and hatred."
His story, he gave Boyko a piece of shit!
Dnipro, who wants to take the two footballers of the section, is preparing for the second half of Antalya Belek.
Technical Director Myron Markevich spoke to a public institution about the 27-year-old Denys Boyko on the Black and White List.
Markevich said, "If you have two clubs, go to Boyko, and make him a champion."
The 1990-year-old Brazilian stopper Douglas Silva Bacelar, who planned to transfer the President Fikret Orman and his establishment, also reported that Stuttgart was also interested in his 64-year-old student from Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, the Argentinian player Jose Sosa, the Black-White, found out the details of the official offer from River Plate.
The head of the club, Rodolfo D'Onofrio, explained that he proposed $2 million for an experimental medium-sized field, but that the Department wanted $9 million.
He turned his eyes into Super Lig.
