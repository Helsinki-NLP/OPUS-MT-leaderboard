CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor paternity in Prague.
The new CSSD elections in the capital area will obviously have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand at the municipal council with their former colleagues and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they knew the Argot who was born during the last few years at the fair, when they were partners of the current coalition that were leading Prague.
The vocalist argued that Prague's political cream was in the course of the previous era of Mayor Paul Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that the new elections do not fully understand the terms known.
At least they say it.
"This is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a young man in Prague's politics who responded to Lucas Kaucky, the choice of culture to the "parrain" vocabulary test.
And with regard to the political veteran, the election of Karel Brezina has reacted the same way.
For example, the word "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you suggest I use"
Otherwise, I don't use Argot.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Actualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the ODS Pre-Electoral Congress, the edition selected 6 examples, in particular those related to the mayor of Prague.
Socialists should explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf club in Prague", "all to the patisserie", "boeuf's nose", "capital tragedy" and "encourage".
Three of the elections were agreed for the castle, the fourth one - Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not drop the phone.
The fifth election of Peter Dolinek successfully rejected the test.
"I don't care about all these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy show up: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently working on how we are going to understand ourselves in our programmes," he replied.
As we have already heard, the election of Lucas Kaucky would not appear in the legend above, which is about the influence of Janusek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does not say anything at Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the biggest golf match in Prague".
"It's about the Blanca tunnel," said Kucky, adding immediately: "But I know about the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay me a language course," he said.
Not only the Killer Karel Brezina but also Lucas Plachy, the environmental elite, know that the golf course is Blanco's tunnel.
The two social-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lucas Plachy know where to find the person - he means "go to the bakery".
"It is, I think, going into a business," Plachy is ready to become the headquarters of Janusek's companies.
On your own, Brezina recalls that he takes his knowledge out of newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no argotic logic in social democracy.
"I've got some advice with my colleagues and it looks like we don't really have anything like this."
"The names are sometimes used for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democrate Party, who members of the Party call Hilda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, by Karel Brezina about overnames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and walked.
The Weinert election is Papy for the party's members or the least friendly little old Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the scroqueries during the party's sponsorship, is called "the little joy".
Surnames are also the only ones who allow social-democrats to work within the party.
It appears that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hilda, but every day Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
He recalls that Peter Hulinsky received his doctorate's title at JUDR. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of "sorcers", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, foreign reported women have common treatment.
They are part of the old generation, they can't work for health reasons, they're free and they don't have children.
The one who becomes "sorcer" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We no longer judge young women in good health as they participate in work and raise children," says a sister who is working in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of over 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to act against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help to limit the hunting of turtles.
It's a "hic" thing.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," warned the daily Die Standard about the inconsistencies of written education.
The charge of sorcellery is current in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and then burned with the oil they had poured on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
The criminals claim it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual injections was found in contact with the woman.
The oil flashed, it seemed, when the team wanted to "break the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sorceres" is approved by people from all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The human spirits eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the sharpness of the shocks, the Gambia has seen the President himself in the last year.
"After the death of his uncle, President Gambien Dzammi launched a large massacre against the nurses who seemed to have participated in his death and would have been forced by black magic to kill the President as well."
"The calls from Guinea to the shelter brought to the presidential station in Kanilai under the protection of the police and the personal custody of the President, the men and women elected in the Hasard in the villages of Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
Prisoners were required to drink a plant-based potion of hallucinogenic effects that produced further effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure, about a billion people were released free.
The tenant of Bakal: The hotties, he signed a higher rent.
An old taxable man comes out from the door of the company RPG Byty's "carb bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried a case with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his wife, his daughter, and his son, who are going to clean up a punishment.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to adjust from the next year for a 2+1 second category apartment of 4400 crowns.
"And there is no hot water, and heating works on solid fuel," says the poet on his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I've signed it at the same time" he explained to you for anger and half-resigned.
The city association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new conditions for rent as "immoral and independent", advises the tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, the date on which a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed.
But man reacts to it by a hand gesture.
"One said that, the other said another thing" by pushing the sources.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic do not meet the market price.
Currently.cz has decided to visit the "laborator" personally for this reason.
RPG's waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m. in the morning.
Right next to the door is a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is on the touch screen.
A single pressure and paper with a random number on the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to shine on the big screen at the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction it's your turn.
After a short time, an old couple arrives to learn about the rent, but the new rentals don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to deal with current problems as a whole - demand for repairs, insurance events and other events.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments receive mail with new dance contracts in their letter box from about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them an increase in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special key for new rentals is open to the public since 18 November.
"he's been working for nearly a week, so it's still at the test" answers, after a while, the employee behind the tip when the client is present as a journalist.
The demolition and old Bbal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of Parliament and the former President of the Ostrava Lubomir Zaaralek region of the Democrats has been sufficiently supported before the elections and is now filling local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new plan."
"They haven't even changed a piece of board in the wcs, the man mentioned in the introduction calms down.
However, in particular, employees believe that pensions will be made to ensure that they will receive a return on the new rental price if they now sign up as RPG has promised in a special offer.
It is a return of half the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will sign their new contract before 15 December.
But the "delegation" guichet of the Havirovaska street is not really acquiesced by the issues.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," says the employee at the guichet.
And yet RPG is posted both on its website and in the vineyards of individual entertainment on the houses when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent it is an independent court that will decide.
"It is not a threat but only to inform on the unique and legitimate way of acting legally," says RPG on its website.
"No one's going to the court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the client centre gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee immediately feels bad at ease.
"We'll come."
"Mr. Zaaralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
The rental regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rentals do not always reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Paul Klimes, director of the RPG Byty resident portfolio, who is just the neglect of the housing fund that angers the tenant is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG has been able to invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen extended to the ceiling in front of the refurbishment defects of the Havirosvka street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments."
"And this will always be up to more than 7.50 Czech crowns m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase is only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
"In these cases, this is an increase in a very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns at m2," RPG adds.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not result in a radical but progressive increase of 4-8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in the rents (cf. the graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the increase in rent agreement have priority.
The mother school is part of the office that includes architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he would also open a small mother school with everything he needed - colorful walls, imaginary furniture, toys and finally a land of miniature games on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can be made.
The Arch. Design. Architectonic Project Company, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini-matural school of business since the first ruins of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially of the age of children, and it was important for women architects and project managers to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced working contracts, the mother school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. in the framework of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.They themselves imagined this mother school and with the support of the leadership they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mother school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding grants (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and, after two years, provide qualified staff as well as road construction.
After the use of funding provision (two years) the company Arch. Design. has been obliged after 3 years to operate the minimum mother school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the Economic rating company that helped to make the grant application.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a maternity institution every day take care of children. Children can go to a maternity school without age limit but have more than three teachers.
As it is about a "Mother School" there may be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more to replace.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is a care and individual education, the programme of the primary primary school is similar to that of pre-school education.
Children only play, but quality education is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation of school banks English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginary games and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their children and do not have the stress of being late to look for children in a remote school from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus included among the companies that offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and are friends with the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HRs.
The house in us continues to fascinate after 100 years. Leave an eye in the interiors of Gaudi.
The toy looks like two of a prehistoric saurien, the ladder to a vertebral column of dinosaurs and the balconys to open fish holes.
So it's the house of Casa Battlo in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received the surname of the House in os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, square fragments and mosaics, making up the stairs and all around the curves, that's all that's important for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front face of the house opens its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, we see the geometry, rhythm and order that is precisely thought of.
In the night the face of the house becomes even more dramatic and it is lit up in such a way that the impression of the brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The rotation and rotation of shapes also appear within the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies the windows frames, balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyeelton and the lammes.
The Battlo house, which is located in the Eixample district in the Passeig street of Gracia at number 43. It was born from the construction of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house ended in 1906.
Investor Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolition of the old construction and construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house in multiple housing was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that decorations for a representation apartment of the owner of the furniture and the use of the mosaic for the façade are born.
Other artists and artists also worked for the audience.
The joint work on house plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises named the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "the house in os".
In addition, I was referring to the specific window opening mechanism called "the bathroom".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges, the patron of the Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture include hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system at its central heating time, with air-conditioning events and typical roads.
Their 45 degrees inclination seems odd.
During Gaudi's creation, he did not fully respect the construction guidelines and was not allowed to interfere with them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city's side to build, knowing that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion, the municipal council was threatened and asked for changes.
For example, it did not favour the members of the municipal council, but the pillars of the construction were impeding on the public trottoir.
There has never been a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city of Joseph Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner would move to lower floors.
In the gallery at the second floor there was a common living room and a third room and a private part of the apartment.
The cut-off was rented to a restaurant.
The entire six-storey house is divided by a stairs by which we access to an independent toilet terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern space link concept.
The common party can be fully connected by opening the halls doors and the high society can communicate comfortablely or well within the private space for more intimate entertainment.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction also received new forms of non-traditional towels and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with the light is also impressive, with blue and white vibrates with which the inner court is decorated and with lighthouses.
The two-colour game provides a maximum light in all stages of the house.
It was simply enough to reflect on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that otherwise absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
The first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to break this step in 2002 at the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous Creator.
They continued their visits because they noticed that it was a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and to the border, including the toilet terraces.
The ticket to enter the monument is not really expensive and cost 16.50 euros; students, pensions, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is still above the entry price in other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a friend among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mate and a summary: women have criteria other than men.
No ostentatious frame, but instead of the quality of the area reserved for bed, therefore the matlas and the summer provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must be complemented in harmony to please a particular user.
During the selection several things are determined: weight, size, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the matlas and the summit is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the camp house where latex matulas are not constantly damaged, they are not suitable because they "recreas" gently.
They have a higher weight than standard polyurethane materials.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in their heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who passes the light of time abroad where very expensive materials are often used with a rammelling layer will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's what all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and sides, they needed materials with a rammelling layer of percussion mouse."
"These materials are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore abuses the "information" of articles and skin," explains Sylva Adamkzykova, who specializes in restored furniture.
That's why a few years ago the matula with the Persian mouse won the hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico also have suitable materials.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to appreciate a transparent mouse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimises its rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat or adapts to your body's heat.
Nothing pressures you and you won't come back in the night as well as after a difficult match.
You'll just sleep better.
The Persian mouse also works as a protection against the shadows.
To choose the material according to your size, add the length of your feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For beds in one place, singles, for example, are recommended to take at least 120 - 140 cm.
It's convenient for you to visit.
However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are sleeping on the floor you should put your hands comfortablely with slightly spread ropes. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Materials and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching in specialized schools.
For a bed in two places each needs its own summaries and mats, however, be careful when choosing the height of the matas.
But it will only stay for you to mount the summit at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Mushrooms should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the rising mats of at least 15 cm, which is for the shape and air layer of at least three centimetres.
"When you touch or sit on the material you don't have to feel the resources," says Héléna Prokopova.
Each material requires a well-defined type of summary.
The bed-summer, when the matolas and the summer are together as symoshes sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The materials were very bad; we don't have to wash them, which is happening very badly today.
And since during the night it is usually transpired from 0.2 to 0.75 l of the sister it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mass begins to remember a big (and empty) friend.
For this reason, experts refuse to make the claim for a 25-year life term for a matola or life guarantee.
But it's all his butt.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm sheet, cancel, for the cover of the sheet, to the hygiene or washing machine, but add a protective sheet that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though today it is common to make clothes with glazing closures for the whole, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) neither handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed from a small weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid plate in your bed instead of a summary?
Never!
At least for one bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the plane (if there is no) of airflows and use the source material with a minimum height of 15cm with suchet sources (Germany Taschenfederken) and an air conditioner.
A polyurethane material must not be part of such a bed.
For single-position lamb summits with 14/18 lambs, latex or sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coco noses), it will always be better for you to have a mass with more than lambs, 28 and above, where the lambs are doubled in the bottom of the kidney and so it is possible to adjust their rigidity.
For multi-position tables, no source tables should be taken because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to fixing the rigidity of the needles, we can also install what is called a spindle.
This is a special binding of needles that allows pressure to insert the needle so that the needle of the bedroom "integrates" properly.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the two," it's really an important thing.
This is already being considered by the materials manufacturers who began using a rammulating area at the level of the shoulders for "mousculins".
But they also think of women - they also offer them a more softer surface at the level of hangas.
For the most difficult customer there are shorts of needles or plates with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure varies in more points and decreases tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad ear (large and airborne) on good mats and summers, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple ear: the ear must support the head and its points only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm for Scandinavians by example.
When it is extended along the side, the threshold must set the height of the sphere (with the tip of the summit or the rammollie area in the matlas).
Modern matulas still have something common with the first ones based on straw and grass.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to biomass.
The raw materials based on petroleum, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use only soja.
"The quality of Bio for materials means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for the coatings of materials; one of the first was the real floor.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes from the forest or laundry.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of boulevard plants to absorb heat and cool the body, "fried" the man, the clothes "chauffen" the women.
The extract of red powder accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current preferences?
The materials made from frozen mustache (it has more holes with a disturbed cell structure than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the frozen molluscs provides polysane matillas that know exactly where the head, bottom and foot are located.
You're playing a quality scale from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters are less than VAT and are considered as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached its first place.
Saving for the matter and the summaries is not easy.
From time to time we may have special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers of two materials for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company offers Duofreeze matulas with the memory museum used to cover 190 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of persesive or viscoelastic mice with an open cell structure and a large spacer was started with the matter of Tempur at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a material for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to the launch of major load factors.
The Tempor falls to the heat and drys, on the contrary, to the cold.
He therefore adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic muscles are used not only for materials but also for products for health, such as special shoes for feet that relax the legs and the vein system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
The devices to monitor people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child is growing in the minds of more people to monitor them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track people's movement and help in some cases such as that of small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a bottle of lamps but will soon be of the size of a view.
The case of little Anicka has raised a large number of people and they have started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private life.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I'm afraid there may be cases of abuse of such devices, such as placing them in the bag of someone who is not currently present, but I haven't met such cases yet."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what purpose "the bottle" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child doesn't want to bring something like this to him, he will get rid of it.
"Even the smallest can show great creativity when it is about to get rid of something when they don't want to be under control."
"The portable phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long-term expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very controversial.
"If it's a ready rapt, the author will do everything he can to keep the child out of electronic devices that can locate him."
"At present, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will also search for them because the sale will be supported by a publicity campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be on the police," said the psychologist.
It's just like such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers car tracking services and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device may be set in such a way as to be in regular emissions after a specified period."
"In case the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who has slipped and is in a long position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, the portable telephones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having been trained with a special programmer.
The problem of the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to those that is present at the time of the size of a light bulb or of the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, tests are currently being conducted to make devices similar to common digital displays.
"It will have the advantage that any aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will return it after some time, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of acquisition systems of a GPS position (which is used properly in auto navigation) and a function of a portable phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonators that it could make the Czech Republic tour with it, but it can only have two years.
The army bought for 445 km of wires used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought it 224 km.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of cords is from two to four years maximum.
The army bought codes that were detonating to the anonymous STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general government has given rise to the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cables to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the estimates of the reservation to be held by the military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES contacted, it is recalled that even generals, law enforcement officers, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual duty on explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army, are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonators.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the military reserves could subsist there for 10 years.
On the contrary, if it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to cover more than 2 m of detonators, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and genes - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the early intervention brigade soldiers have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their poignant weapons and that the shootings are limited because of the need for money.
We don't talk about lack of body tongue.
"And I don't take my head if they buy us so many detonators."
"That's their decision, and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive to be happy traders," said STV's business director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of kms of detonating cordages are due to the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, is only four years of life of detonators and police and military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly placed in the warehouses, it can go up to four years," said one of the two who did not want their name to be published in view of the military's criticism.
The duration of life passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains complete and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a low amount of 445 km of detonators.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than last year's delivery of 245 km," says the Pejsek spokesman who interprets the opinion of the department of defence buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the pyrotechnic codes of police that neutralize the munitions of the second world war or that of the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition required to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for the safety reasons of pyrotechnics and for the more flexible access to more modern and reliable types of detonating wires.
The Ministry of Defence today has serious problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong two hundred thousand men were preparing to move, not on the Rhine.
What awaits this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted in a few years: to neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonators that it buys today "in the good market".
To this day I benefit from contacts I have received from the competitions.
The sale under franchise of his hotel has helped Lucas Pytloun to win the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lucas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lucas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia he lacked a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had gained while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 to half-demoli apartments.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher studies, it was a courageous act.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region has given me something to do," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment built to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the apartment that he turns into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, the entrepreneur's action has allowed him to open 4 pensions in Liberia, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable one of them was until recently the four Pytloun star hotel design.
This year, he had a different quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the franchise of Pytloun hotels," the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the company of the year has served well, adds Python with appreciation.
The victory has brought him more popularity and popularity to Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often happy and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
This is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he used his contacts and knowledge so far that he could not otherwise have obtained them.
"With those I met with thanks to the competition I began to maintain business relations on a regular basis.
According to him, the reputation for success also had an impact on employees.
And there's about 70.
"I observe in them the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work for all of us.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective of the winner Farmet has the best moments behind him.
The one who came looking for the prize in Slovensky during the first place of the competition for the Company of the year organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky, owner of the Farmet company.
The jury has rewarded its efforts with which it has transformed a workshop in Cesca Skalice into a company for 100 million korons.
"I can say that the reward has encouraged not only my colleagues but also me and has increased our confidence in combating competition," says the winner of the competition in the last year.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the Communists, he did not long delay, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with some friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they started specializing in the press for vegetable oil.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic press in Central Europe after the end of the 18th year.
The company was even known in the non-specialised public after the success of the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to really get to know the brand Farmet but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that had achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the school year did not pass on to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was made from the 2008 and 2009 economic results.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
In addition to the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped from this situation."
"The business figures fell by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even license," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that there is an urgent need to take action from time to time.
But they managed the situation correctly and kept the benefits even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, they continued without commitment to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with grants, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibition halls and gained the main rewards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky said.
Let us all think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of employees is also renumbered.
"In a new winner I want this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which deletes unintended regulations.
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The most glorious winner of this year's Absurdity survey was the obligation to provide documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, social affairs administrations requested a paper extract from the trade register while the staff member could obtain it in two clicks of interest.
It changes with the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will no longer require the extract from the trade register for insurance payments controls," said Jana Buranova, a spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Making all the rules and orders that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's Absurdity competition.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Homórske noviny and has a greater popularity.
If the last year 3,000 votes were expressed, at least 4,000 this year have brought their votes.
And this is not surprising, there are many legal obligations in our country that make it more difficult for the company to freeze.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for fiscal declarations first in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activities becomes a declared goal of all Governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is located at the 74th place for business conditions, 8 more than last year.
The Year's Absurdity competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Any person who can make a statement every year of administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To take account of this, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for the "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during the month of October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and at www.ihned.cz.
Absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared winner.
Until the last year's investigation, it is one hundred or more exactly 105 regulations and descriptions that have lost their sense of existence.
The notes are sent by entrepreneurs but also by trade unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition is, for example, the obligation that road maintenance vehicles and fast roads pay their wages, or even if entrepreneurs with twenty employees claim two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition site.
The invitation to tender, which begins at the beginning of November on the Veneslas Place in Prague, is part of a restraining party that regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Peter Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended at the moment of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts tons on the shoulders of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to eliminate, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today make it difficult for the company," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd descriptions is not a drop of sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a parking lot.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Company Act.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a 30-day travel of service for a foreign employee, was deleted with the text of the Law on what is called the Green Card.
And it's okay until the third session of the competition.
Absurdity of 2009 was described as having a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balance sheets.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year; the obligation to have a refrigerator was deleted.
A new category rewards the socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or other sports projects have been evaluated.
The news of this year's Homórske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Company responsible for the year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and maintain a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Portal Phone Operator, Vodaphone firm, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the annual rebellion competition.
For this first year of this sub-categories of the 2010 firm, organized by the Vodaphone firm, companies that have not succeeded in achieving a single long-term objective for the company are registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article should be published.
Although the object of their enterprise is different from one another, their support activities and forecasts can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Of the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic, there is no example of the Prague and Netera prologic society that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of the firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main contributor to the grant fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
In the case of employees with health problems, the Old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant which employs more than 70 per cent and for this reason has been entitled to the company responsible for the central Boheme region and which is thirdly placed in the region in the competition for the Vodafone Year.
At Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has obtained to introduce business hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week by average and, without being proportionally, less pay.
The jury also owes it the title because it buys priority for Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoinian activity in the immediate environment and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryzarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible for IT Login from the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has established for each portable computer a drawer and ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses local-protected catering services for their actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, company representative.
At the last level, there is also a Lavage and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of benefits above the standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transport, increase in qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically included in the category of company responsible, all regional finalists for the Vodafone Year Company competition, which had responded to the questionnaires in the joint part of the registration document and sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incomplete or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the trade unions had not responded to the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company responsible but were not qualified for the "principal" competition of the company of the year of Vodafone".
"Independence inscriptions are not possible because it is a sub-categories of the main competition of the Year's Company," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organisational agency.
At the Plzen Land Fund, the police conducted arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the minutes to the local contractor and marketed Lubos. G.
This was an effort to direct just a call for public tenders for the regulation of a refund application so that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for a crime of initiation in the context of an appeal for tenders and a public competition," said Pravo, the chief of the Plzen Antonie Zelena Park, knowing that he is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police returned after 24 hours this 46-year-old freeman.
To know how it could influence public competition, we can only specify how little official information is available.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman of the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund indicated that the police had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace, which was during the public competition.
"It is a client and in no case an employee, it has been specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for the right to transfer land under the Land Act" and has been implemented when several law-enforcement candidates appear.
"These persons, in the context of the appeal, offer a higher value of their right to refunds which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the proposed rights a class of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesman.
Lubos G. had, of course, information about the persons who were registered with the appellant and, as he is himself, a beneficiary because he had purchased a large number of entitlements, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was no doubt disappointed by the fact that he had to leave.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpolation.
Lubos G. had extensive contacts with FdT standards (Funds des Terrains).
He was involved in the case of FdT Chief Vaclav Sankot, who was continued in prison to edit lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, in particular in place and place where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he will exchange it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is much higher.
The mayor was obliged to accept because either it was likely to put the construction in jeopardy by a blockade of the lands.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns per month for housing.
From January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rent will also increase.
Thus, families will have to pull their wallet from January to a hundred more monthly crowns from now on.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas by almost 2 per cent more, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be closer to households per 100 korons per year more than the current.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices by providing sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but certainly when people need it most and thus have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the price of central heating varies from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay for central heating by January almost 50 more times a month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1,000 more each year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, there is an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If rents do not change the prices, an additional 6.8 per cent will be paid.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest compared with the whole country.
In Bohème of the north, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 per cent.
For example, rental prices will increase significantly in the 450 000 apartments rented from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company that owns Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments has decided to increase to up to 100 per cent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be transferred to the courts by the company.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 per cent next year.
The children of Czechs are born into rhum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and is always mild.
Fernet, rhum, vodka and otherwise the best whisky brand are also stolen from parents.
These are alcoholic beverages that are most common among those who are breast-feeding, who are not yet 15 years old, among the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for relapses are not excluded.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who experience cases similar to the admissions of hospital children's departments.
"Bears or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
"The trend is really strong alcohol," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the Horovice Hospital's Children's Department in Central Boheme.
"When they succeed in picking up a bottle of pop in the closet, it's about some whisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus do not feel it," explains the Chief of Department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokesman for Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's from rhum or fernet."
"It's today alcohol in fashion, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, he has acted out of slivoves that they have recovered from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Chief of Pélikan department, seeing children aged 13 to fourteen years of age at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years just in a pediatrician where the ambulances were bringing students from around the world completely ill.
"A young girl was therefore hospitalized four times
"She started her career at age 12 when she was breast-feeding with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with an extra mixture with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovie Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that he didn't seem strange to his mother to be absent for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the frustration of parents or their tolerance outside the community in that their rejections are found to be the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, it is not about independence, in its strict sense, for children.
"A chronic dependence on alcohol for several years is understood under the alcoholic's vocabulary with all the phenomena that come from it but that it is not found in children."
"For those who use repeated alcohol, it is rather a significant negative social-family background," explained the Chief of Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova portal, about forty children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatrician clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in statistics.
Ivorian children who are following emergency care brought to their home by parents or by the police are not accountable.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, there are three seasonal cows with which we can count: the day of the sorceries, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
" Either they drink by violence after bad results or they celebrate the start of vacations."
"Of course I have lived on the day of the tears with a single single-birth child permit of 7 Ivy children," Pélikan stressed.
The Hebrew child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically better than the one who came home and suffers the next day of the "wood hole".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by glucose infusion and nutritional elements required by the body.
"They are better Lots for this because they spend an excellent night and then a gentle awakening and nothing harms them."
"They're only surprised at the place where they're found," Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time this gag is the good smell of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care can go up to tens of thousands of Koreans.
"From time to time, I have applied it as a means of education, taking into account the cost of their irrigation and that they could spend all their summer in seasonal work to pay one evening," Pélikan added.
However, he said that health insurance companies in their regressive management, who should receive care-related care by parents, do not treat the cases of ill-treatment children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign operations in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has replaced Casa C-295M transport aircraft, dropped Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS is staying.
It's the first time that devices of this kind become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the context of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is biplatic versions of L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and have been in flight.
The remaining devices are monoplasic versions of L-159.
These stations for the moment at Aero Vodochody and the commercial center – Omnipol firm – took account of them last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Defence Press, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is for an unknown time.
"The L-159 spare parts for exchange were taken on long-distance aircraft without additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 libraries have been changed in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He pointed out that the army will not remain unbiplaced because the ministry signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 with an agreement of 200 million korons for the transformation of four L-159 non-used singles into two bib.
The army took delivery of the first device in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it was committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance's countries.
"In the contract it is clear that the one taking the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve as pilots of NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one taking into account how to do this," Pejsek said.
Homórske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was completed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence has not launched tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the exchange ensured future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 Vodochody Aero devices and used them only 24 to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in the framework of a European-wide tender and in no case contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already delivered three planes from Casa, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the canceler is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the anhaler are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the amazing conclusion of a Wednesday study published by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the shower serves as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles, professor at the University of Warwick's Cancer Research Institute.
The honey could thus help determine which men should be subjected to the test of prostate cancer, including combining genetic risk or other increasing factors such as family health precedents, added Eiles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the canceler.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had the same length fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the chancellor, however, the risk was 33 per cent, for men before 60 years of age, the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The long-term report of the two dozen cities - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterine.
At least testosterone represents a longer index.
Previous research showed that it is just testosterone that helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is currently in this study but that he does not seem to think that the relationship between the length of teeth and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 roads are closed.
Czechia like most of Europe is this morning covered by snow.
On the roads and trucks, there are most of the time of the compact snow, the miners worked all night in many places.
The D5 road is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 road in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The driver of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told her about the information
In the 91st kilometer, a truck was injured, and in the 93th, two heavy weights were injured, the accident suffered injuries.
Several cars have also been found in the woods.
The problems are also on the road D1 to 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks are damaged.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190th km or go through Brno and then enter the 182th mile to Kyvalka.
A number of miles of cars formed in this area.
Also on the D11 highway, there's an accident and that's exactly what happened to Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimetres of thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created in Prosek, the Sterboholska street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take the delay, for example, on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the major state of the crisis in Prague must still meet.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast links due to the snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
The Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 p.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rumbled but with renewed vigilance.
On Vyskov's road, three side roads are improbable, Brno's road begins to have snowy areas and Blancko's roads are mandatory to pass some communication routes in the higher places.
The Vyskov region was part of the most affected areas.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milessovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowflakes and showers.
We can't estimate when they're going to be rolling.
On the road of Hodonin the wisdom is rigid in the region of the White Carpathies.
On the roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, held only by the presence of inert products, there is also a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warning CTK.
In Czechia, it fell between two to 10 inches [10 cm] of snow; it fell most frequently in Bohème from the north, with up to 18 inches [18 cm] of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 inches [15 cm] of snow.
The blackout disappeared in Chequie gradually.
The Americans have a new "intellectual weapon"
The U.S. Army sent to Afghanistan a new "intellectual" weapon, known only as the XM-25 code name.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an impact on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate canon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of several meters.
Special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive is actually functioning as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explore the target contact, but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
So we can use it against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a hole.
He is no longer protected above and when he falls upon a deadly rain of steel, it can also put him out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first child training weapon that uses "intellective" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus gets a specific point of view, where he corrects his target site and supports the prisoner.
"Let's say you've seen 543 meters."
"When you press the holder, the weapon is loaded and taken to 543 metres more or less, 2, 3 meters away, Audette said.
400 deplaced jobs
The Fujitsu groups delocate their Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park their place of work, which is currently located in the premises of the Place Mareinbader offices in Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu delocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he said Wednesday, the specialist in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the work place of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader site of Bad Homburg City, will be transferred to Astro Park, an enormous complex of offices located on the Lyoner Street street of the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, the group should group 100 more jobs so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Furthermore, open-air offices in Astro Park are better suited to the work of the partners.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also a real tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner stated: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is our primary location with significant infrastructure."
It claims that the connection to the airport is just of great importance for a global undertaking like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important business within the region caused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losses.
Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), the economic manager of the municipality of Frankfurt, said that once again a "planetary actor" had been won.
It's an "extraordinary profession of faith about the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees to the city and its implantation is an important element for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg's mayor, Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"He's not gonna say we've offered our help to this company," Mr. Korvisi said.
However, friendship relations would have nothing to change from the computer manufacturer's difficulties to the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In conclusion, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place is not occupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, used so far by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "vertical bridge", as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienabad, were part of the project of the controversial construction of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance from the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. This led to many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the areas that sometimes served part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment notation company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specializes in Immobilien-Cancen purchased buildings occupied by Fujitsu while the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real State Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group whose headquarters is in Tokyo is considered to be the third largest software supplier in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and provides essential services.
Its subsidiary located in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to be installed in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other branches on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square metres have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, opens up among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Menaces against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has released from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This hidden attitude may be political pressure after hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes have been published.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is increasingly attacked.
The Wikileaks cyberactivist group has lost access to its host server so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, American Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies at the Wikileaks Boycotter.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is researched by Interpol, is likely to live in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikilaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists from the origin of the revelations through the social Twitter network.
Earlier, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyberactivists have been using the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to access the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formible, our dollars are now spent on people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The CNN television chain, quoted by Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon forbade Wikileaks to use his servers after the survey conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The President of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott to its face, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse the use of servers through the platform.
"Wikileaks is an illegal, monstrous and uncultivable way of doing this, which puts our national security at risk and at the risk of ruining life all over the world," according to a communiqué of independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether it is American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of violence, is listed by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australia lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is located.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified for orchestrated intrusion by its tractors the prosecutions committed to his encounter with Sweden.
Wikileaks' spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told London that threats have been posed against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was particularly afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks keeps hiding.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to the statements made in North America.
In the United States, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that Wikileaks' revelations be continued and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief of Government, Stephen Harper, announced on television that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
During this time, a polymic emerged between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, Vice-President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama, described as "ruin and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assagang demanded the resignation of State Secretary Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats and recently disclosed that he had been involved in spying.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government is now fully in the bank trying to protect its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for the fight against refugees.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the deployment of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which all administrations exchange and protect information.
In addition, the U.S. Government announced that it would want to take care of the security of dissidents and soldiers if they had never been threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have implemented everything to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley of the Department of State.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the University of Gelato in Bologna, ice compressors are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day course organized for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
They did. Where'd all the ice come from?
Of Glacier and the ice machine.
The ice cream, i.e. in German the slightly decomposed ice compressor, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice production.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the frozen wine with the help of a spatula, it's available in the garage and then starts selling it.
To know, we don't need to go to Anzola del Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian Carpigiani firm.
The sorbets manufacturer founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that ice creams from his machines respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day course organized for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and extend over several days. Practice sessions are also organized in private ice cream.
In the full-time crisis of the quarantine, a number of people hope for a new career, others risk simply to satisfy their burning desire on the cold ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, an art education professor from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European product of quality in the country of industrial ice.
Also in Berlin she is advised to manage the company and she wants, after a few years, to pull something unique from this test for nerves.
Two Egyptian youths hope to open a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children worshiped Italian ice cream.
The skimaster Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal features of perfect ice.
It is determined not only by the good wisdom but also by the smoothness and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training of the cheese on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still maintains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing is actually simple.
Luciano provides basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a robot installed on the machine: it comes out of a pasteurised base white cream, based on all kinds of ice in milk.
The trainer is quick to test the question: Is it possible to manufacture ice by using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can free course be given to the personal enjoyment of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano cautioned against the fact of letting himself be misled by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have been used by stabilisers: most often a natural product, such as the grain of guarantor obtained from the garnet.
Of course it is possible to manufacture ice without using a stabiliser, only it needs to be sold within a 24-hour period, or it will sink and the customer will crochet nothing but ice granules.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more passionate with aromas.
Master Luciano sets out the difference between the ingredients obtained in the fruit or pastries of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to represent twelve aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Both in fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Both in the ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to the eggs, becomes a yellow cream and is, when added to the cocoa powder, the basis for all possible chocolate deserts.
Now, all participants in the course have to go through the use of ice machines.
Luciano invited them in time to produce four types of ice: wool, chocolate, moca and nuts with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less wool or other natural ingredients.
The different types of ice for fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The ice on the nuts does not necessarily contain the taste of the nuts when it is made up mostly of nuts.
The ice in kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly captures the taste of a ice," says Luciano.
The production of ice is a calculation exercise: if it is used to clean fish with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for ice to lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the grapes are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the root muscle).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The production of ice no longer requires both physical intervention.
This is not just the machine of automatic manufacturing of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the mixture of ice is cut simultaneously to make it unquenchable and brought to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, small pans are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbows the fruit of his head on his feet and thus excavates his study friends when the control of the blender ball colossal escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident is likely to occur during each course: it's just a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguity position
According to some sources, the industry which has experienced the culture of genetically modified plants has exposed the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered to be an independent institution for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," said Wednesday at Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information is that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked closely to develop the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and was thus clearly in a conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr.then.
The prescribed requirements are in line with the Ilsi pressure group's positions in paragraph and are thus the trademark of the industry which would, in essence, be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
It's already the second time Testbiotech claims a conflict of interest.
A senior officer of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss Agro-food group Syngenta without any condition or transitional period.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed personal relations between the European Union's control authority and industrial lobby, which raised both concerns of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry, are exploited as well as professional quality.
Experts working on the Efsa account are not prohibited from contacting this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper acknowledged that he worked for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based on the United States.
This body is considered to be a neutral forum comprising experts who, among other things, belong to science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without the money of a lobby.
In this regard, independent experts such as Mr. Then find out that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding test and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize on the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, not all genetically modified plants, which do not produce reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then about your defendant.
That's also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is trying to further influence or deduce critical sciences.
Therefore, there are still researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the opinion of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell searched for it, about 400 kilograms.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube at two.
There was a manifest.
It was wrong.
The story is known: In September the excavators were here and began to detonate a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousands of people demonstrated against the S21 project, the conversion of the main train from Stuttgart to a underground train costing several billion.
A large part of the bridge was in ruins when the demonstrations started on the end of construction work.
Breaked in 6000, 7000 lacquers.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier calcair) of Crailsheim, a pavé tente and gravel built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
Some fragments have been searched.
"These stones are relics."
"They don't have to disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "A modest and well-marketed, simple and land-based rock."
He says that when he dives into the ski, he heard the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
You Gsell too.
the trails of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old storage of the French army ammunition in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man makes old stone trade.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were beaten or disappeared in the discharge," he said in his office in a hut, which was sometimes a guard post.
He reported that he had been subjected to insults and threats when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the North Nile to the demolition company.
But he negotiated with the S21 project opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing to resist demolition.
And if she did, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 S21 opponents then carried one of the weighted-weighted stone paraallelepipede of an average of 80 kilograms of value between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory while hoping to get it back during a reconstruction.
Rongen had 500 tons, 25 full truck charges.
About half are still concentrated in the forest, the rest of which have been sold for many years.
Owners of gardens, landscapers, Particuliers.
They came from everywhere and carried everything they could enter the vault and the trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or within the limits of the grass band.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"and this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, making the tour of his wide empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he had left. Later, he started studying biology before he became interested in information and eventually became a career.
And a stone amateur.
The stock is 40,000 tons.
He loves his treasures everywhere in Germany.
He says he's the biggest merchant of old stones.
He's talking about it.
Sculpted sand stones with art are placed on the snow.
"Sometimes they were part of the Marienbrück bridge in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, gentlemen, please say it with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the way up through the forest.
He shows a bag of dougs: Pierre red sand earlier, part of Karlsruhe's car.
That's it.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepide was a member of the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
Around the snow of stones and stories, Cannstat's cross from the police prefecture, the red granite from the St. Blasian cathedral, the tube from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sister!
When Mr. Ronggen thinks that stones were sculptured into hand and moved with simple pallets and carts drawn by bows, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He didn't become rich, even less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculpturer, a baker, a glass fan and a gardener are installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's grateful," says the waste recycling officer.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
There's stones to save.
Fight talents to win high potential
The accounter knows a living influence.
16 students are shopping to buy small bread in salmon, tomatoes juice and white mangoes.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the future car with VW designers, and then they know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to compete for better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most suitable diplomats in the amphitheaters before they reach the employment market and are not escorted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they are trying to detect exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical University of Brauschweig, the car group loves the talents.
A young staff service lady shares the styles, bonuses and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She is talking about the calendar of professional courses and studies for young talent students; she shows them the ways to access the group's fire.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for the two parties: "Students come in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can meet students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who are online as a partner."
According to Mr. Sei, such cooperation is inconceivable.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract students.
"Sometimes the focus was rather on the professional project," said Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new diplomats will become much closer.
In the property of the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by making a trip on a roll of candidates.
But they need to be reliable and, above all, to cut the hands of highly qualified workers.
These are especially the diplomas on engineering lines that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineers remained unemployed in October.
And according to the VDI's projections, the gap in engineering positions will still increase.
Roman Dykta is going to hunt for talents for the KPMG account, audit office, accounting expert and advice.
It organises cost-effective events for the recruitment of talents, such as the KPMG-Race cross course, a sort of paper rally where competitors must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students to the United States in the coming year.
Participants can access KPMG's branches and know the company.
The person who has to participate there shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of many candidates will be involved in the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to seek high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to get out of the lot through the cross course."
"For us, a simple cruiser was too little"
For Mr. Dykta's talent hunter, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in contact with all the people who have taken part in the last year with similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon." he said.
In addition to direct landings in the fields, small and medium-sized enterprises are performing in a classic way by participating in professional careers where they are delivered to the brains.
"We are trying to reach the graduates by participating in the professional halls."
"For example, in the solar technology room," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, producing photovoltaic panels.
This company located in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the problem of recovery.
Currently, 35 posts are awarded on the company's website.
"At this point, it's very difficult to provide vacant posts."
"It costs a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions such as the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional courses or to write his final study project to us."
Honorable advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to make its advertising work by implementing other qualities: personalized environment, silver hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many times a large group can't do this," said Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in finding employment.
Flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for promotion are other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute of Great Place to Work, Solarworld is one of the 55 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is an annual salary table for German employees.
To this end, he asks the staff members about their degree of satisfaction with regard to their work and their context, while taking into account the staff conditions.
The chief of staff, Ms Stübe, hopes that this investment will allow the company's image to be restored to job seekers.
"I think that candidates are particularly referred to external assessments with regard to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employee Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employee to become attractive is through his own colleagues," he said.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the user's brand image within its own effective.
"collaboraters satisfied with the best messages."
When dealing well with their employees and they identify themselves with the company, they only make their employer's advertising with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing it in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama's branding new oil barrels
There will be no new oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico along the coast of Florida, South-East United States, over the years to come.
The Government of Washington has declared a ban equivalent to a ban and has finally cancelled its initial plans.
Even across the Atlantic coast, new forests remain banned for the moment.
The Secretary at the Ken Salazar Interior made this Wednesday announcement.
This is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform which is the source of this strict ban. It must remain in force for at least five years.
In the face of this incident, which cost 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this activity sector, indicated that he was willing to allow for new forests to be carried out in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The parties to this solution therefore want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries for oil supply.
The question of knowing who is responsible for the devastating black marina in the golf is not so far definitively resolved.
The British Petroleum Group, which is faced with several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary at the Ken Salazar Interior had lifted the gel of the forest described after the platform was exploded.
Following this decision, various oil groups had promptly submitted applications for new mining projects.
With more strict controls and more serious security signs, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been deposed after many allegations of corruption, is currently in the process of further reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would eliminate the lucrative tax cuts of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this activity sector are now publicly aware of the fact that the food deficit in the Gulf would be much lower than the case so far.
"The Government's objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit office, before the ban on mercury-producing drilling.
Furthermore, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been reported up to the next order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oil; it emits a smell similar to that in the essence station: Because of a flight, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live by flight, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't push yourself," says the environmentalist to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a young man wrapped in water up to the bottom of the bridge, as well as the grass train that surrounds it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water discharge in the colour of the arc-en- sky.
It can't be seen that the sub-soil is resistant to crude crude oil nappies.
On the river of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she was collecting blankets from all over the lakes here.
But in the meantime the calm waters are completely tartaric.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil fell from an oil tank that exploded in the huge marecage.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo must now take six hours to reach the fishing waters: the country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the width of the shrubs greets your eyes when you cross the mangrove walls through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the engine boat throws a cradling water. Whoever extends his hand removes all oil-covered.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil like reeds. Insulated palmirs leave their palms sad.
We look in vain for the birds' nests, as they are usually found in the wet areas: When the engine outboard stops, a fantastic silence lies on this paradise at other times like a service station by the smell it leaves.
"What happens here is a war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battle field that has been inhabited for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers came here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni is still prohibited to this company: whereas more than 2 million gold barrels are pumped daily through over 5,000 drills and 7,000 kilometres of olive oil throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni are inexplicable, as the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters are turned into the water of steel chairs as strange sculptures: The heads of wooden Christmas are described as very delicately.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them are driven by corrosion until they recover.
Akpobari believes that a head of nature's forest falls from time to time in mud, because a constant fleet of crude oil melts into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have emerged on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that of oil that emerged in the sea during the "Exxon Valdez" disaster 21 years ago in Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, sabotage and siphoning of olives are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution. Environmentalists for them consider the explosions of forest heads and perforated olives as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner appealed to the Shell Group to apply significantly less strict safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world: Only the rate of misconduct of conduct is "more high than all others".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, from a distance, looks like a abandoned workshop, full of camouflages and installed in free air: They are completely naked and covered with camouflages up to the end.
A sharp fire under one of the many tunnels that are so related to the tunnels, so that unreasonably sprayed on the site must be repaired: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tonne for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the essence of paint in a container through pipes, then, at the end of the course of the kirosene tastes falls and is finally obtained from the diesel.
So Michael and his four colleagues produce four barrels of diesel 300 litres per day: "It tells us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents are part of the chronic fuel shortage in Africa’s largest oil producer country.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than the ridiculously low 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they buy their first material free of charge.
it is offered by "protectors" who place the network of oil pipelines in a vacuum across the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the entire Delta of Niger.
Only a small part of the first provisionally placed matter is illegally cleaned: organized crime networks that also include high-level politicians and military members, the lion's part in tanks and the brand on the world market.
Military Akpobari considers that the debate on the issue of whether environmental disaster should be attributed or not to subversive activities to the population or to the mode of Laxist production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intrusions and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage nor illegal flights and refineries."
But, in the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so damaged that it was no longer a matter of retreating the group. "probably operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better revealed."
So Michael's getting nervous.
"It's a great time for you to quit" announces the Petroleum Open Robust.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not do the subject of an arrest, but they will also offer them wine powers.
Even the soldiers of the north of the country, especially those of the north, intend to take advantage of all the Nigerians of the first matter.
"At any rate, this trick figure has caused our low country to fall," Akpori laments.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
A380 is obviously suffering from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible lack of construction that could lead to "the catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas Air Company now wants to complain against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas were apparently more likely: During the investigation it carried out, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that some A380 aircraft reactors had a serious security problem and it was aware of a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it may cause fatigue and flight calls at the level of oil conduct connection, as indicated by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a catastrophic failure of reactors.
The Rolls-Royce reactors are concerned and have 20 A380 aircraft.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land immediately on 4 November in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian Air Company has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allows her to take other legal measures against the company.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages to the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts have been detached and the bearing surface has been damaged during engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it's oil inflammation that's the source of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors are now to be replaced in the world.
Australian researchers have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with reactors.
The security recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the ASTB spokesman, Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, Quantas Air Company had evacuated all its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor as a precautionary measure.
The two-stage plane is the largest line aircraft in the world.
The fall of snow across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany's entire white cover: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
The chaos rule on all roads, trains and planes are real estate.
At least three people are killed in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany grelotter: Because of glacier temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered by snow in the night of Thursday, which leads to chaos in many places.
In the north and the east, snow cover reaches 15 centimetres per place.
The movement is strongly restricted on several roads and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were not able to get to the bottom of the snow that had not ceased to accumulate.
In addition, violent raffles swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) is waiting for these seabeds to take place along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above normal.
The snow masses on the roads and on the federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Centre for Warning of Bad Times Meteomedia announced the level of Violet alert was announced in the Saxony: it is actually the highest level.
In some places, it has fallen 30 centimetres of cold snow that strong and cold winds have dispersed.
A number of trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the country of Saxe Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 road, the snow and the wind caused a stop in the movement and caused the noise.
In Thuringe, snow falls hit the A4 and A9 roads.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious railway disturbances took place in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, down trees on the railway roads, canals or ruined needles.
In Saxe, interregional transport had to be interrupted in Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Salfeld, Thuringe, an ICE train for Munich had to stop its journey.
The pumpers and paramedics had to provide 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drink.
Snow wind blew the roads.
The snow Chutes have caused many cancellations of flights in Germany's main airports.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport password indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers connected to the airport are no longer numerous, although 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
At night in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit by a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized.
The driver has lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car took a ton on an ashaffenburg skirmish.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be soft and soft, but it will turn around in case of mild raffles.
But the wind will fail.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it makes very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its yellow tours.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This property could report up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just been able to improve the group's seat: Jewel towers in the business district have been modernised; while waiting, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
The financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, such as the magazine "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a password.
This password did not specify the reasons for the intended sale.
He said "if it is more interesting to take care of the buildings or to sell them, and to refurbish them later on"
It is also the largest financial institution in Germany that has already dropped its seat shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the gold towers for EUR 272 million with own fund holders and then rehabilitated them.
The energy optimization reforms included, according to some indications, around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this activity sector appreciate the value of the tour, rebaptised between "Green Tours" and around EUR 500 million.
According to the spokesman, we do not know at present whether the properties will be resaled to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for school-based minors who were declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
It was not yet possible to rebuild the bodies because the security situation of the sinister pot continues to be cautious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been expelled from the land.
A probe had been introduced into the nested well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the strong concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief team was able to land in the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration had considered that minors were no longer able to survive.
So far the bodies could not be rebuilt.
Today, parents and friends have arranged a celebration of the Memorial of the Dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a shining sun in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 learned minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, boxes and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfaces, also had their place.
The stairs were placed in front of all the country's public buildings.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the Memorial that New Zealand provided hope that the children would be back on the surface.
"But they've never returned home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was taught in the fields, said he could not re-sign himself to accept his son's death as long as he would not see his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
The first explosion of 19 November also took place in South Africa and the United Kingdom.
The rescuers began spreading a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, burning temperatures within the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
The performer Nicolas Winding Rehn explores the boundaries of the old species through his film, "Wahalla Rising", an epic fighter.
In what public could Danish realiser Nicolas Winding Reffn well think about turning "Wahalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) who has only one eye is a prisoner; he is free from his bow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after one another. This seems ideal for young male spectators seeking a blood-staining action, just because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in bad mood, he draws his enemies' instincts without expecting them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bourgeoisie says no word about its real name. Even the other characters let go, however, in the absence of one or two phrases some possible agonisation crises.
Rather, we say nothing and we celebrate in the beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
This would be more ideal for mature filmmakers who are interested in existenceism and excellent travel.
When a film covers several target groups, it is harmful that they are excluded from each other.
The realiser Winding Refn has been considered, since the appearance of "Pusher", his trilogy with regard to drug dealer Farouche and full of style, such as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the film of art and trial.
Most of the sympathy of art cinemas must try to look at the brain that is spreading around and to the instincts.
The amateurs of action movies are killed again, when the castle is aboard, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship for Jerusalem; they are born for an eternity of peace and brotherhood before the crew arrives in America and continues to withdraw.
It is not surprising then that "Wallalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only in the DVD format.
This is especially due to the magnificent images of the poor who deserve a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bleeding appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor about a coherent action, all is an ambiance, a snow dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't get away from it.
Refn gives him a moment of rest and slowly cuts his throat with glazed images and a loud sound band, but especially with an insatisfiable hate that tears the heart of the individuals.
Only a young blonde boy, who is faithful to the side of the castle, maintains some innocence, all others are encouraged by anger.
More than all, the hero whose mobile phones are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by becoming warriors, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents corruption, but perhaps nothing can be done for those who are anyway.
"Wahalla Rising" is an eccentric film that we can hate or admire, which has for the purpose the excitement, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Secretary works of terrace
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications of a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less to submit itself to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four F-15 Israeli ships attacked a mysterious Cuban-shaped building on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the river Euphrate; the largest town near it is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is contained in the AIA documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone paraallépipede, dissimulated in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a United States information service briefing, the CIA, from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring area, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would enable nuclear weapons to be manufactured.
In contrast, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video of presentation that has a stream of satellite images.
Through the computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the centre which represents a minimizing copy of the North Korea model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the pictures showing the building located nearby, looking inside it.
It seems that the reactor was on duty, but he was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, more information is available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery is growing.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that the CIA was certain that Syria had built an reactor in El Kibar, but there were few indications that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapon programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious on this matter and speak only of a "reactor forecast", even if they consider the presence of the CIA as "pleasible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how it was ensured that it was a nuclear reactor, a high-level United Nations diplomat had given only a laconic answer in the meantime, claiming that IAEA had " sufficient documentation to raise questions".
The Syrians must have precipitated the defeats of the "unusable military building" and carried out a methodical landing on the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in El-Kibar the uranium traces produced by men.
In addition, IAEA received satellite images from commercial suppliers at the time it was directly following the attack. It seems that the latter are more exciting than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish its identity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret nuclear programme and that it has not built an reactor.
Damas argues that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particulars by qualifying for investment.
Since then, Damas has rejected any discussion on this subject as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of El-Kibar and refuses to access the demolition of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel kept a tight grip on it.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in force at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
The investigation of this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without a result and has become "increasingly more and more into a serious issue of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-level Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is finally a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-free treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of three other installations that need to have a "functional report" with the alleged reactor.
Until now, inspectors have not indicated which installations are here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the journal "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known under the names Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah as well as in the name of neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) of Washington identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf which would probably be one of the suspects.
It is possible that it is on a military basis or directly on its side; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the three IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is stated that the Syrians are reducing the inspection team to be in fact spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is information provided by U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the stone parallelepipede in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "use fuel production".
There would be no "indications on sensitive activities", such as the richness and withdrawal of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works through non-rich uranium.
However, there is the severity of the pulsible assumptions about the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where later the plutonium needed for the production of the bomb would have been separated.
It is ignored if the stocks, which could hide high-value traces, were stored on the three sites.
When hundreds of truckloads of land will have disappeared, no one will have information on the storage site of the warehouses.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that in 1998 Syria had examined Al-Tibni's salt mine, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could agree to store radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of satellite photos for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelly established a link between them and the relevant reactor.
Photos taken by satellite show, however, that Syria has carried out terrace work on the three suspicious sites and has moved huge containers when IAEA began to require access to these sites.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but this has not contributed to removing the suspicions.
In the diplomatic environments, the IAEA has been developing a plan for inspections to be carried out for several months. This plan should allow Syria to retain any military secrets. Only investment time shows the great interest of the inspectors in this matter.
During this time, Damas also made this proposal sound.
One year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not been able to do so, the emergency would not have been reported for this matter, for example, Glyn Davies, United States Ambassador, who has been referring to what has been known for a few months under the special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has available to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still reluctant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority of the IAEA Governors Council and a large number of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation on a scale.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who thinks, "Would it be worth it if they didn't find anything at all"
Love in Time of War
It's bad since Angelina Jolie started her summer as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbian origin.
We know nothing more about this story, but it's enough to provoke malaria.
A persistent Roma indicates that the woman, a Muslim, has fallen in love with her Serbian storm during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the tour sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and requested to meet the actress. Jolie is herself a well-willed Ambassador of UNHCR.
She's not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario tells us enough about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic ' s organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for the withdrawal of the quality of Ambassador of Goodwill from Angelina Jolie.
But what kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who received copies of its scenario, granted a tour authorisation in Sarajevo after a few delays, but we do not know why it did not then come.
The young author himself ensures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, but that she does much effort to face the Yugoslavian conflict. She supports her desire to implement the terrible consequences of the war and to give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about its content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circle on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where man works as a guard.
That is also a big difference with the version "a victim of violence loves his bow".
That Jolie's movie started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, as Jolie says, is "unjust and based on incorrect information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can seek peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as well as others before.
Let's get out of here!
This evening, it's all going well with the Irish.
No trace of contamination.
This is why the local team dominates the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cry out with joy at the bottom of a strong music, they shake their feet.
Cork's Balleyu-Pub in southern Ireland live because the players are starting and are able to land table tennis balls at a distance of three metres in the opposite team's beer goblets.
This strange show is called "bier-pong". The winnermpoch 500 Euros more air ticket for him to go to Las Vegas in January to the world's bier-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and reserved information, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
Despite this, 26-year-old man is trying to be fun, to turn away from the frightening issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in its projects. In January, it will conduct boarding entertainment in New Zealand.
"I'm trying a strange feeling," he said.
"The country of birth is so far away and I don't have to work."
Finally: His wife is already waiting in Auckland, "at least two, she revealed her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the country's nightmares, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, her brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even planned a number of 200,000 immigrants from here by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, this will be a current of migration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, the chagrin now takes its place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting young Irish, well-trained, who have known so far only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social exclusion seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But, in the meantime, three people under the age of thirty are in unemployment.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes widely the letters of readers written by young immigrants who complains: "In Ireland, everything goes on."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity goes and our country as a whole."
"The last one to leave the light. "
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a more bleak future because the government is only making it look foolish and offers no hope for the future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her friends creep out of a non-payable practical stage.
She says it's her greatest concern to immigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to address this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingA BroadExpo" room that offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But foreign work is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps at the level of the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of Australia's surfing and snow surfing in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a career, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
Six months ago, Seán O'Donovan knew what it meant to be based otherwise.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just off the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his country of birth, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete his contract credit to build his home in the country of his birth.
"The situation is already a bit rough," he says by breaking the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I get money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live practically no longer."
It pops out of an enchanted laugh through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-equipped front yards, with expensive large brand cars stationed on the access routes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 euros, funded by the credit.
"It was times of trouble, no doubt, money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything going down because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects on a moment, pauses at the hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to have fun and I'm young; even if I'm going through, I can go to zero."
The construction engineer doesn't like the complaints he's often heard these last days.
"No one has to suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what has sometimes been experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not what can happen worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
This idea please to Cian Tanner.
Let the future go and discover how life is going.
In his palmerese, he already has several years of work in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his wife.
But there is one more thing that concerns him about these last days: the festival to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn herself into an adieu tonight.
"But not many emotions," he said, drinking a long beer gorge.
"An accident, it seems quite worrying."
"Let's call it a night to see, all arrested, meeting some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does private enterprise.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey conducted in September and early October.
The first is quite sunny in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
In Peru, for example, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, democracy support has grown from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has returned after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the region, are convinced of democracy, which reduces the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region's respondents were satisfied with how democracy was functioning in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as in the last two cases; however, they grew significantly compared to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America have challenged support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again decreased by 32 per cent this year.)
But moisture varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are translated into a widely shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have increased.
It is only for the second time since the poll began that more than one response across Latin America in its entirety mentioned crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they or one of their neighbors have been victims of a criminal act during the past year; however, this figure is down to 38% in the last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for the private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of the region's respondents say the private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62 per cent of Venezuelan respondents are of this opinion (and 80 per cent support the private company); although their left president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriated by many private companies.
Brazil is the largest miner in the region, mentioned by 19% of the respondents (over 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9% in the last year), and Venezuela (9% in the last year, 11% in the last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote was taken
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the land was in fear.
Boxes were presented and a new survey was presented, ballot papers distributed in the gates, polling offices and intimidations.
The voting offices opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were moved after the January seismo, would be in the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them ended up leaving.
A dozen candidates to the presidential office, including a number of alleged favors, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, senior officer in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a pretty good choice in matters".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have frankly stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, whether serious or not they were, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are renegotiable to René Préval, president of the People's Republic, and to his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Miranda Manigat, an old lady, were withdrawn from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no tangible support among the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round.
With a cold cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the seismo still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be involved.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the organization.
Nearly 250 000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The ring is important.
Donors see the choice of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the foot towards the center
In the weeks after becoming suddenly widows, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a public sympathy wave that has improved its approval rate of 20 points to more than 50%; this is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, to turn this into a successful campaign for a second term of office during a election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently sad, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that were underestimating tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income voluntarily.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition was divided, and the situation was clouded in the development following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart crisis on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist Movement were contacted by Ms. Fernández.
But after catholic meetings (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers and where others accused the corruption government), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue with you," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President a much larger margin of work to spend on will.
The economy is largely overcrowded: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1 per cent but of many private estimates and union wage claims, this figure is approximately 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his role in 2003 when Argentina was in fear of an economic collapse, put the growth and reduction of poverty ahead of inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he hacked into the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, the statistical office, which had made official inflation statistics false.
Can Mrs Fernández now modernise these policies?
She called for discussions between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit the increase in pay next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
However, inflation has resulted in a drop in growth due to a strong assessment in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with officials who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its opportunities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be raised towards and agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve supervision by the IMF, as it is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudoudou, Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which is similar to a prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the church is very persecuted.
When the Argentinans return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have flown.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to review many policies of her husband.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese electors are headed towards a kind of union closer to the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the desert?
More than 7.5 million voters were present on 27 November, or 70 per cent of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general evaluation by the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having developed innovative business links, including a partial free trade agreement, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
I've done my test, but it's all right.
Although its part Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five medals, it has failed to win most of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressist Party (DPP), which considered Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all votes for 45% for KMT.
If this had been a presidential survey, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the part of his party's vote has fallen by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, including KMT in municipal councils.
The event has revealed most of the main topics of Taiwanese elections, including capturing trucks and mass-assemblies with girls who danced at minimum.
A mandatory mysterious murder attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, Honorary President of the KMT, has made an election tour for a KMT candidate in charge of the election.
A man of the crowd shot at young Mr. Link, just across the face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Unfortunately, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any way, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspect on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe China was the biggest winner of the elections.
It was disturbing to see how far the question of the Continental Party itself had been.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its real independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its links with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from activating anti-Chinese feelings.
This is the answer to a new awareness-raising approach that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, requested confirmation to know whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to return to Taiwan.
China has not spent time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but we start with the beginning.
This is better to be expected after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP is all over again.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-Bian, had been sent to prison for allegations of corruption.
The President from 2000 to 2008 was an advocate for an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates saw the day under the direction of Ms. Tsai and the PDP working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate to the presidency, as His Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their part is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their entertainment can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "deservable alternative" in relation to Mr. Ma's earlier approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to have been exaggerated by this change.
In a statement published from its cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have obtained better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic officer, not to interfere with the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have the wrong to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; despite a vertical economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its population appears to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office as well as his local antennas would be repaired.
The PDP's good results suggest that Taiwan's support for the approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Appointments to Grammy Awards: the jazz song Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "best new artist"
To make a president's request, and people have to take knowledge of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked up by President Obama to celebrate the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, noted one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a great reputation in the "best new artist" category.
Considering that Spalding is a very well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that a artist should not come out of more than three albums before the registration; which "makes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaged vocal style, his capable hands of pop and fun and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed at Spalding in relation to the success of Norah Jones in 2003, which is the closest for Grammy Awards electors, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards electors have rightly been entitled "History" by Vijay Iyer Trio in the " instrument album" category, a turn on a refreshing freshness from a registration that was one of the main favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by Veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by pianoist John Beasley will be particularly competitive.
Trombone Shorty, in favour of the Russian voice of the New Orleans and often invited to "Treme" of HBO, was respected in the contemporary jazz category; it also strongly moved towards a certain merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the Darcy James Argue Wilderness, familiar with the Steampunk, has gained some well-founded recognition in the big group; in competition with Billy's rich room-jazz children Ensemble and the eternal adventure Dave Holland whose album "Paths" of his eight lives was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as head of the group.
Appointment of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey are in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards year include a mixture of musical landscapes and composers around the world.
In the head of the nominations, Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestra work, with three "yes".
Among those appointed with links to South California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in line for a reward.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra recordings, opera, choral and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" showing various artists; and "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the names are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Love of Loin" by Kaija Saariaho du Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of Orchestra and the Heart of the Seainsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition are Pert for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattoto More", Magnus Lindberg for "Grafiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 was first at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil miner Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was named for its solo instrument performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he had just written the 15-minute work for the interpreter at the Avi Avital commandline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a large number of North Africa games and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old chief of orchestra, Pierre Boulez, received a appointment in the orchestra performance category to lead the Symphony Orchestra of Chicago in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumentistic soloists who received a nomination are the planists Nelson Freaire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only names of soloist vocalists: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic mixes, soprano Jesse Norman received a nomination for his registration "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula mosque project has won the approval of the Planning Committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics were taken into the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners said Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the word Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of them as American citizens."
"It shows that justice brings it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18 hours and lasted almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at a time of almost equally divided speech, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There's no more America," wrote an interviewer.
"It's another single planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America's fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also raised protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, where attacks took place on 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoussh declared violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 co-familys has been unaffected in the Riverside county for years, but she wanted a greater and better space than the store she had rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 foot mask on the Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two mines and rise to 43 feet high.
It occupied a 4,32 acres [4.32 ha] site on the road to Nicolas about two miles east of the Chapral lycee.
Opposers can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerating microbe raises the possibility of new life on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of an alien bacteria, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and maybe beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the abnormal bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorous or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" way of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report contained in the online edition of Thursday of Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and pain.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria discovered in the Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the arsenic phosphoric.
"We ask what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in researching life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, knowing what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we think are absolutely necessary for life, could not be established," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who conducted the study, chose the Mono lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it specified that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have the wrong to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like the phosphorous; it paints inside and somehow destroys the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the known bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorous but the fact that it can live with the arsenic at the place raises the possibility that a life form using the arsenic can naturally occur either on Earth or on another planet or on the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphorus was not new; nothing ever showed that it could go.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; so researchers have exposed the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to shape life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two birds of exposure flew were found in Compton
The other two dogs of exposure on four flights from the outside of a motel in Bellflover were found, the sheriffs of the Los Angeles county announced it on Thursday.
The four exposed dogs - two kittens and two yellow pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, announced to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered after noon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, told Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the Los Angeles county sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were restored to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They met on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for animals from the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old woman - were healthy and safe, announced to the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show to regional competitions this week, for the owners of Japanese dogs, were gone until their Wednesday night discovery.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend under the "AKC/Eukanuba" National Championship in Long Beach, where they were planning to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in other trials scheduled in the days prior to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Wednesday Times.
South California is one of the stops in the canine exhibition tour of nearly a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and guarantee their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs - a Chiot Boxer, a terraier Parson Russell and a spaghetti breton - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis in the farthest corner in the truck where it would be cheaper.
They've got some windows open so dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 p.m.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, which is a micropouse installed to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to rediscover again, the restructuring of MGM is no longer waiting for the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green fire to start again at zero.
A federal judge of New York's bankruptcys officially rented the "pre-embarked" plan by creditors, according to which about $5 billion of debt would be lost; opening the way to the entertainment company, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television.
With the decision of yesterday that the plan met the requirements of the U.S. failed code, there was no legal obstacle in front of the MGM to return under the protection of the Founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an all-embracing study.
The staff will be escorted to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase does not have a $500 million credit facility intended to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under a licence by the Investment Bank, which itself amounts to $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was engaged in providing guidance on how to invest its funds, since it did not have the means to pay the interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old Enron PDG and a well-known returning expert for his work at Krispy Krem Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and meet more than 140 students in the studio took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
However, the sale of cash attracted a few bidders who were not willing to pay the amount of 2 billion more than the creditors were searching.
In the spring of this year, there was a need for any reference as the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that was finally approved by creditors at the end of October after months of internal disputes and discussions.
When MGM officially fails in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a "first success" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which has been only one film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films that will be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be carried out by Peter Jackson.
Investigator Carl Icahn, who holds around 18% of the MGM debt, has tried to fusion the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Play Tech to maintain your budget presents in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful game is the IPAD, follow, perhaps, through Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important step in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bicycles at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic pearls, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and the Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, this year's technological game is likely to have more strength; however, the same price is slightly lower, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games associated with websites, two of the most popular types, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the play on buttons are increasing, as well as the play on rechargeable piles.
Here's some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, except if otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are playful games of the size of a Indian cocoon that sings a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start supporting, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated doll plays around games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative articulating feet.
Children who have overplayed the game use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the '80s, you will remember Alfie, one of the first computered educational games.
He's back (Hasbro / Playscool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a bag full of question card cards designed to convert a car ballade into a session with auto-correction and a van classer.
If you are upset when your child has your smartphone, here are three autonomous options.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3-8 years) is the most expensive and easy to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games are not as effective as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for 3-12 years), it is the first major review of the Leapster range, with a more recent and more bright screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-type system to offer electronic games and books and has an entry for SD card that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a group of five-blocks with more than one light box, each with its own LED screen.
The aim is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time is over, which is ideal for an unprecedented orthography competition.
More and more, players have a kind of online connection.
By their presence in game stores, the two largest are Webbinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online company animal from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) which includes a marked part of a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two items in the selection.
It can be made of rolls or of a company animal playing Puffle.
slightly larger than the dust at the bottom of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10 for 5 years and more) is the last piece of plastic microbots.
The false animal quickly moves on 12 live silicone pads in random directions.
It's fun to make a block labyrinth to see if she can find her way through.
She's strong too.
We survived a fall from the kitchen table and even a moment's pass into our dog's throat.
Bringing a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin hired a place in the city as a urban training officer by seriously inspecting his nerves, by issuing low-level orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - responsible for public order in China, afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and thought of violence - to convey some impression to a set of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be careful!"
Show them what beautiful girls look like!
Four girls who had a painful childhood in white gloves, clothes and identical olive-coloured pants, were in your custody.
Four pairs of black-and-white shoes tied to the rule.
Four perfectly cared hats caused by the top of hair attached by a blue and white needle.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with a detached look.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to break the image of the city inspectors in China.
A city required that all new recruits have a higher degree of study.
The province of GuangDong has changed the greenery of uniforms against a more demanding blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with their eyes in a strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had engaged in uncontrollable snack carriots by throwing black views, firmly for half an hour, until the co-porteur reimburses his business and part.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban area of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, their skin and their young.
The idea is to give the depressive police a softer side, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulties looking at this underground urban bridge in China
And for that reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depend on the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei hit an observatory after he used his mobile phone to film them while spreading a protest against a shipment of waste.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin inspectors, discussed and posted online, describes how to effectively win innocent offenders.
This year in Shanghai, a pasta collector was abandoned with a brain injury after a bakery with five officers.
A video game about violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to hunt street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," China Daily, a national publication last year, after a first politic on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "real complete cleaning."
Sceptics say the approach is very far.
After the district announced in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, appeared in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in good order."
They must have a size higher than the average, whether of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The retirement is compulsory for 26 years.
The officers stated that the work was physically excessive for women over the age of 25.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer to Rednet.com, a almost government website.
"Firstly, the external qualities of candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; this is the size, weight, face treatments, etc."
Then the temperature and "in-house qualities" will come.
The women of Chengguan are like flowers, he said, "In addition to being pregnant, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not belong to this description.
However, he noted that the requirements for height were the standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement for the order of treaties.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities should not postulate.
"We can't let anyone who pushes or comes to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pummeled games with a thin mouth.
She does not consider her appearance to be sexy, she says.
"Do you think I've got the hot air in this uniform?" she asked you for a detached air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old fellow fossils, says: "Our job is to present the city's image."
They are not opposed to their mandate being limited, they say, because they feed more career ambitions than simply throw salesmen into the streets where they are forced to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen ambulances that move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much as possible of small bread or tofu bags before taking the flight.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We have already said it several times!" said Mrs. Xu while a salesman was running away, temporarily leaving his bicycle-cart at nozzles.
The agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than expensive.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to notify their superior male counterparts.
This tends to protect the Sudanese public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rebelled after spreading false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a vendor.
In one night, more than twelve police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were reversed or burned.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace is not a good guarantee.
Just two houses in the square of Baoguang, where female sex officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the truck instead of in a store, such as their regulation.
The owner of the bike was created on the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm was followed before the police, on the left side, broke down a narrow road towards their vehicle and were involved at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
The Xuedong, 40 years old, a co-ordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white bag returned to hide his name.
Like female sex officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a role in supporting themselves.
Unlike them, they are not formed in order to keep a clear image.
"Sometimes we're literally fighting."
"Sometimes we beat ourselves physically," said Mr. He said of your neutral.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
The prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice raised the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, from a case related to an old campaign assistant and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday to the senator's lawyers.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the President of 2012 until the scandal around his business took place in the last year and ended his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, as a result of a year's investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice had "reported that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charge against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice has abstained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a surprise for many foreign ethics lawyers in the Ministry of Justice, which showed significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have intended to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, regarding the senator's business with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of policy fund holders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a partner of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by the Lobbying Act with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to be contrary to the said ban on the rolling door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and material violation of the law of the rolling gate," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defence of a government investigation.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reason for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the ministry seemed to be in the process of having political persecution after a number of high-level revisions by its section of public integrity, including the last year's decision to abandon the prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct of prosecution.
The federal prosecutors were clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the head of citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now take the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the ministry was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a communiqué, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the park.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to give up an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96.000 by Mr. Ensign to Hampton's parents violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that money was nothing but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find work on lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after accepting Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's head of office, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martialized" the Ministry of the Interior on a dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had engaged Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When the news of the case appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his post as leader to the fourth grade of the Republican in Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to set up a third mandate in the Senate.
Noting that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would soon follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and finalize its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call points to Twitter
One-half of them were on their way to the hearing hall.
They sent every minute of the terrible witness reports via Twitter.
Finally, the defence said there were more than 140,000 messages on the violence and children involved in their beds in a house that had been burned.
Thursday, the widely followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should be brought before an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already submitted elements to the court that require arguments of appeal, which can be held by the courts for years.
What's causing is that the intents of reporting on the process - as well as the generalized and widespread use by Twitter journalists - created a " circumference atmosphere " and satuation if exposed and instantaneously with fire details that the jury has been adversely affected by public passions.
The application could lead judges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this process; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms will affect the human rights of a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer by Mr. Hayes, a lawyer.
The judge of the case, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State, unanimously rejected the claims in the trial last week, claiming that the media were "soundly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been motivated by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the subject.
The appeal courses have recognized for decades that media coverage of known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a 1966 trial, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopathy, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, claiming in his decision that there was a " carnival atmosphere " in the process due to the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television and the film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers stated that the appeals courts took to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of hearing rooms, which were invisible in the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in the major shameless processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue says that some appeals judges may be disturbed by the idea that limiting instant communication from hearing rooms could lead to more fair proceedings.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr Hayes' lawyers, who may have been discussed for years; which delays execution.
The defence attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the actions of potential juries by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the jury's selection.
Some of the jury said they were threatened by the victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence attorneys claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge has unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been criticized in front of the prosecutors, and that he has abused pressure on a verdict by making an unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate in a week-end.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the impact of the intense media coverage of the process could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, which was filed last month, that the case was dominated by the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by the candidates at the Governor ' s post and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the media did not stop focusing on the flames of the business's emotion.
"The daily scandal of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the court of justice," the lawyers wrote, "they were nothing like what they had seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement, which the news reporters were more fire - than the media were slowing down, was a ludicrous view that would lead to the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals were often drawn by arguments that social and technological changes required court-martial adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 which had challenged Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and explained that they would invoke new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represented by Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring closer to the cliffs?
After a campaign marked by investment and negativity, a minimum of civility emerged in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of real bipartite cooperation before or at an illusory time before the quick return to the partian struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not take place on major issues that should be addressed during the "boxed" session.
However, there was at least a policy discussion on the differences between the two parties and on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Committee's public Wednesday meeting on the President's deficit was still civilized, despite the political differences that remained between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect across the ideological atmosphere; however, it still divides the members.
It is painful enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of testing and testing each other with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
This is why the Tuesday meeting and the participants' subsequent comments have raised a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed in the last two years.
As far as taxation, expenditure, health care or rights are concerned, the two sides remain at thousands of distances.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, an administrative officer from Bush, now on the side of the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections are caused by party passions and then they are surprised.
It's okay."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boxed canard" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
The two parties want to find a way to preserve one or all of them permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise on the extension of unemployment allowances should be considered only because the Republicans cannot give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimistic plan on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the "box" session with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th convention will meet in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely to be inevitable.
"Once things have to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism which would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electors present in the tea which contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, knowing that they must try to raise their promises to reduce public expenditure and repeal the new health care law.
These positions are timely and are already clear in the first response to the recommendations of the Committee on the Deficiency, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reducing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the issue of public agenda deficit in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes to be taken by the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had the wrong idea of reaching this number.
The greatest resistance exists among the group's elections, which suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, with little or no grounds for compromise.
Galston has two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of party confrontations, given that the Republicans are responsible for Obama's budget, tax and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
The public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then the two parties will observe closely the public's response.
The one who will be judged lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
The spirit of the party and polarization are larger today than they were in the middle of the 1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological difference between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the military of the two parties saw 2010 as a simple prelude to a more coherent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be needed on both sides to find an understanding field on issues that still divide them.
Published American documents describe Moscow as a heritage of corruption
The city's control is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and passes to Kremlin part of the wine pot and the protection money it collects, reported the United States Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service perform huge rockets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putine called the "vertical power" - takes its part while the money goes up to the top of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exported.
It was edited while Iouri Loujkov was still a major in Moscow; he was largely responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there have been few cleansing traces since.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who had a first-time construction company, have always denied the allegations of corruption over the years; and he has obtained several disdefamation processes on these charges.
In September, he said what followed a Russian television channel when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's shooting, it's nothing."
The Russians believe, to an increasing majority, that their society is corrupt; according to surveys.
However, it is unusual to find the information contained in a passport account; it is unusual to imagine that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to the term "disfunctional" and to state that the government was working more like a clandestine than a government," according to the ambassador's note.
" The criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " (the term used in the criminal world/the mafia which literally means " roof " or protection) through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as through the entire government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analyses to identify a three-level structure in the criminal world in Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the summit."
"FSB, MVD and militia are at second level."
"In the end, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups gather an empty in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB saves the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "It was explained that the owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (more than organized crime groups) because, not only, they had more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they were also protected by the law."
"That is why the application for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is widespread, protection itself may be unfair; even those who suffer are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not suffer quickly see their affairs closed under one or the other.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption, but he allowed little progress.
The note of the embassy transmits accounts of people who bring bills, probably full of money, to Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said a recent interview by Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indem".
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of a political class because he doesn't exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of power, he said that corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would rise to more than $300 billion a year throughout Russia.
The country was classified 154e in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified as at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, of Moscow's time, will certainly reflect the discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the shortcomings of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of resolving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Potine has shown the hypothesis that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing process and has reacted with anger to the claims that U.S. diplomats had made known the name Batman and approached Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor of domestic policy in this country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be achieved with such pride, such pressure and, you know, in contrast to ethics."
The old fighters of the Red Khmer forced to face the past
In a poorly-explained classroom with concrete walls of poor quality, the director of the secondary school of Anlong Veng mentioned the man who had built it, the last head of the red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"All the world here is my dear Mok."
"He was a good leader; he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when it was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remained popular in this isolated village of red Khmers in the north-west of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of ancient soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the red Khmers returned to the government, the long-term loyalty was finally granted due to Long Venge.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face public people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the story of the red Khmer children of its former soldiers.
In July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, delivered its first sentence on an old member of the Red Khmer, condemning, at 35 years of imprisonment, the former chief of the famous torture centre of Tuol Sling, Kaing Khek Iev, best known under the name "Duch".
In the face of this change in situation, anxiety has increased with the old fighters of the Along Veng Khmer Red Cross; their efforts to reconcile and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodia's society are complicated.
"There are feelings and fear among the old red Khmers but they are forced to do whatever it is," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"To them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
Under the Red Khmer regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the Government of Paul Pot-United States in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army were on their way to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement was completed in December 1998.
While Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading their base guard located in the mountains of West Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up to Long Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to make a mistake in the government, culminating in the capitalizations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who was head of government forces, was captured in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 waiting for his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the old red Khmer fighters have fallen into black poverty, common in the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some officials of the Red Khmer elite kept their positions as local director instead of placing the weapons, it was not qualified farmers at the low grade and directory.
"These people benefited from very little follow-up after capitalisation," Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, who organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed by the Utopian ideologie of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
On Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before being installed in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds all over the world."
But now life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The red Khmer court in force has also raised concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, initiate the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Trith, another former red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the main criminal officers, but it did not say whether it continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more time to calm the fears in Andong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district chief in Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma barrier, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, on a Thursday evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the camp near his wooden house on pilots, on a road from off Anlong Veng.
While the sun was falling from long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the red Khmer.
If the court had assembled her, she said she would have refused to go.
"Cambodge is peaceful and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who made a defect of the Red Khmer in 1978, also warned several times that an instability would occur if the court continued to have several suspicions; although experts and historians answered.
"Cambodge must cross a hole and bury the past, he says.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang from the Documentation Centre.
"Reconcilation in terms of Khmer is to reconnaissance the broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Red Khmer, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmer.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the red Khmers, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, studying at the high school in Anlong Veng, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he came home with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are sorry because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the process of complex and difficult reconciliation, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court began to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmer preserves a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a road, envailed by the bad grass and scattered plastic bags, leads up to a black sweat rectangle, covered with a rolled towel.
Paul Pot's body was burned here on a pneumatic pill after his death in 1998.
Num Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile salesman on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many of the people go to pray there," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's anniversary and, later that day, she planned to go to Paul Pot's last place of rest where she would leave a bunch of mature bananas hoping to give her a chance.
Belarus agrees to give up its military quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it was going to abandon its high-rich uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with the Foreign Minister for Belarus, Sergei Martynov, in favour of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up uranium highly enriched and seemed to have devastated the horizon in the past spring.
But the US officials told Washington Post that some classified operations with Belarus over the last two months have been carried out to remove 187 military quality uranium books from a Belarus research center.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 books, according to a staff member who mentioned the anonymity condition due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
It appears that it was useful to seek an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really impressed that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit."
"It proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the World Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton qualified the "very significant, important stage" agreement reached by Belarus.
Obama committed himself to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to break free from all their high-rich uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Security in Obama, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept the uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the uranium of military quality and the uranium very rich," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product ... we're not going to make room bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, expressing its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium in Belarus was particularly complicated in October because the material had been slightly irradiated.
It was loaded on a special train that took over 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to the officials.
The U.S. Government has spent $13 million in its efforts, mostly to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-rich uranium; not adapted to weapons.
"A minute coordination and organization has been implemented in order to strengthen confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bienewski, a Department of Energy Specialized in the Reduction of the World Menace.
According to estimates from the Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 military quality uranium books this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been under way for years, mainly because of the severe repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But the Wednesday statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"While welcoming the progress made on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The Government has issued no objection to CIA flights
The Government has not issued any objection to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda prisoners in Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks every day in El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández of Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed "can demonstrate that they exercised adequate surveillance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to 12 countries, Spain held a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "was surprised by the Government of Zapatero" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From the Vega he stressed that Spain has no objection to flights of intelligence over the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid "take them to the desert," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would give this case the lowest profile possible, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence.
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he did not have to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal element, no sensitive information," explained the Ambassador after he spoke to the prosecutor.
At the same time, the United States expressed its concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than about CNI or the Department of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will make our efforts to address the case differently between Governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are simply jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his colleagues "to avoid comments from an inflammated rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's action in this regard.
"In spite of its general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take part in any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she reports.
The barrier that passed to the eyes complained on the "accapable" network of being a mother.
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Treaty to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is a "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two originals of Noia, the village of Coruña, where she was the original.
The messages are dated 2008.
To understand them, you need to know his emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, industrial.
Their relationship lasted for a year.
Not long after they separated, we learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him test DNA.
We discovered another little friend shortly after that.
The hill was Alberto, a young man from Lousama, a neighboring town.
With him, she's been around for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to find out about the labour market, the girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of its communications, it is understood that their idyllicity is fragmented, they are separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorque alone, and she writes: "Alberto is very strange and excited about the fact that I've come to work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day long and does not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come in this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains: "If it doesn't please him, he leaves him with my mother, and I'll take him when I get home," she says.
In May, she says of her return to her village: "I'm going this week, but I'll only stay until 19, because I have to present myself to a job in order not to lose it."
She explains that if everything was going well, she'd have taken her ass with her.
"He will remain with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him of my life with another person if this person is not my mother," suspicious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July there's another job.
When she shut her down, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the first day of this month, had been reportedly killed on the 10th.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not on the other."
"He's with me on one side, and this place is a little nice to him, but another one goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.
"He'll be there (the child) for a few hours in the summer and I'll save some money from the baby sitter."
On the 17th, congratulations and complaints.
"A very big boss from Caesar's side, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto said he sent you out, I don't know what videos on the e-mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On 30, another: "The child's fine, he's going to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, he's a current partner, and he's like, "He's ahead of me of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had a sign in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Treaty to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, carefully, confessed his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica went into Palma's provincial prison yesterday, from the city centre of Minorque.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she no longer had the intention of doing harm to the minority."
Before she had seen Caesar nestled in the bathroom and placed her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following the significant increase in votes and votes by Members recorded in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already referred to the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more positive than they are, as the number of votes that this training takes in these double committees is normally the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in 2008 to the generals, while in 2006, they had received 316,222.
Last Sunday, PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this trend is maintained, with a result of a decline in the vote of the PSC and the reliability of the PP electoral system, the analysts of this training calculated that if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in the Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10, and PSC would lose no more than 9 Members (at 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, the ERC would lose a MP - he has three now - while ICV would save or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relations with the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and the populace agree with the fact that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would no longer have the opportunity to appeal to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican deficit, it would not be fantastic for this training to lose its representation in Barcelona's capital - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its voting number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only recorded a difference of 500 votes in relation to PSC, including the mayor, Angel Ross, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have been found several times.
The population also recorded progress in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and plans to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has made thousands of passports available in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police formed a Jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Territory of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's attacks that resulted in the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" has "failure" Al Qaida's falsification device at the international level and "as a result, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that in the two years during which it has been active in Catalonia, the cell has sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they have been counterfeited and distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The diamond cell is not the only one that has been operational in Europe, which is why there could be days of similar cuts on the same recorded Tuesday night in Barcelona in the territory of the European Union.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arsad and Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade), another event took place in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muslims Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who were leading the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries since Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly the passengers flew to the passports that met the conditions marked by the term "World Islamic Front".
This is to say that documents should be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45 with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Researchers point out that so far no detail has been found that links prisoners in Catalonia with Bombay's attention, even though the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it must be recalled that a few days before this attack was carried out, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after the members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police used a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complexity
The PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity to present to Artur Mas his personal terms in support of his investment as President of the Generality, identical to those exposed during the campaign, and who was reluctant to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-Sovereign adventures such as the economic complexity that the nationalist leader wishes to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples has arrived at your meeting with Artur Mas with the assurance that 18 members of the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make themselves popular, because the CIU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will take the opposition from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but for the moment, the discussions that Mas has with the rest of the political leaders are crucial to Catalan.
And with regard to the President of the PP, in support of an investment "all sovereign and independent speeches should be eliminated", and economic complexity - similar to those of the Basque country - that the leader agrees to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders jointly have their share in managing the political device of a very excessive self-government and the elimination of the tax applied to payments and donations.
Details of Mas investment negotiations will be taken up by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a strong opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will be with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laporta (Catalana Solidarity).
The bureaucratic claims that the deaths were not due to "a lack of measures"
Olot's owners do not eliminate the possibility that their nightly nurse killed more than 11 people
Geriatric Officers La Caritat d'Olot (Gérone) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 people who were responsible at the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was present with the center's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of the Caritat would be to have the power to bring charges against the responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil servants".
In addition to the social depreciation that the entity may suffer in order not to have time to detect the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to the Caritat is now taking the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victim's parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé warned that the first crime took place in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of geriatrics - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally investigate the dead but, given the age and pathology of patients, formality was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically challenged this situation yesterday and said that "the lack of measures could not at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one indication of imprudentness on the part of any other person who is not charged with it."
The person who was already baptized as "The Angel of Death" committed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed a second mother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it was difficult to control the access of medical personnel from the centre.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analysis will clarify whether Villa did not lie by saying that she had sought for her first victims a less cruel death or rather burned them inside while giving them the lesives as he had already told her that he had killed the three women in the interval 12-17 October.
Caritat does not believe in the statement of the night nurse, not in addition to the number of murders committed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Villa has given in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in how to kill after she has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they stated that they would remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB is at risk
Investors reacted badly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
Peripheral differences have closed the force and the actions of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must no longer underestimate the ECB's ability to corrupt itself and the euro has yet to record an increase, which is a social signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by short and very speculative positions closures.
The institutional investor will lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to come back for the fourth time in two years and what remains.
Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures at the end of the week, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the sale at quarterly auctions for unlimited access by the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We hope that we will continue with the obligation purchase programme and even give the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of yesterday's markets and continue to wake up to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of obligations and broke the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be reliable and consistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the end of one year of trafficking in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent of the previous end.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change in market sense after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, numbers of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February for private capital or will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, figures are included in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in an uncertainty facility.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Heads of State and Government Summit on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we understand all the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present tomorrow's plan of measures approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatization, measures to re-active employment include investment hearings such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Bourse has risen by 4.5%, the double that of the rest of the European Bourse.
Unlike in February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key to a three-year obligation that will benefit from the effect of Trichet, so we hope that it will resolve with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our recovery capacity.
For Spain to request an Aid Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasurer has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, the March triple, very expensive types and they cut access to markets every day.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "on the other hand, the parachute".
Be brave, we can get out of here!
Eulen's President will answer the Vega Sicilia Council requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the conflict open within the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will object because he considers it "no law", El Enebro's next 16th judicial council, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to speak their majority and compare themselves with the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia's titled firm.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José provide their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest hold of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year, which is registered in the Register of Trade and Companies.
El Enebro's judicial council for the next 16th, convened by the Magistrate Commercial No. 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of toners within the family Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge to establish the Assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the Assembly ' s convening.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Martha and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as "a desperate appeal from the applicants to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by violating the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically nullity on 18 January," according to his official speakers.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly has taken place, to be challenged in view of the fact that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the Magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, an estate company owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among others, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requested 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the fundamental question that the judge must decide after hearing the complaint for which there has not yet been a given date.
Red Bull triumphe in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates improvements in real-time cars.
After Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this universal selection of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new tour that came to be, despite the trajectory rising in the last few months, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all compared to the three of Fernando Alonso.
Without losing his skills as a champion pilot, the German Sebastian Vette, not more the power of the Renault engine that propelles his car, is talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put in Red Bull's hands to transform it into a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that Germany launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of high self-competitive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create high-performance assembly chains for factories around the world, power stations, and high-performance instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before it is built in a real way, thus avoiding inevitable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon photo equipment, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this information instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during the courses and trials.
Russwurm explained that the 1992 excursions had an average of 10 technicians in their teams that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 high-quality young professionals are working today who, with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design all kinds of changes on the balls.
Siemens' director explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull's balls except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can take place from the simulator's virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-technology high-tech self-keys.
As the only limitation of this technological perfection sheet there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit on each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to create and produce its balls in a 50-km location in London.
These are two buildings where visitors, especially for journalists, are restricted.
All that's going on down there is considered "secret top".
The staff for this duty includes 580 persons, including two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has contributed to its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is estimable and zero notation.
The company's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R+D's progress in the case of racing cars was 50 per cent of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85 per cent of success, while pilots provide 15 per cent of the added value.
Nevey warned that Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by the information, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install private stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 commercial networks between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plan to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the remand store located on the Great Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she works for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one from Barcelona being the third.
Herero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she realized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HM's management of personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the installation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the sector's experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff from institutions.
Helena Herrero noted that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging".
Barcelona's store includes a space with a global pioneer program that solves possible problems of secure HP computer equipment.
An online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"Then in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already engaged in technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sababell pairs on 'voler' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a widening of interest margins, which will try to compensate in part with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sababell is waiting to catch in three years a million private customers, his job to do.
Sabatell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will hold a three-year long disability.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to benefit from FROB's public subsidies, is to win a market share by the capture of a million new private customers - 700,000 if it is decommissioned from the bank - its large task is to do so, since this bank has so far been more affected by SMEs and companies than the individual customer.
This year he has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5 per cent, while it exceeds 10 per cent for companies.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the pari on productivity, or the same thing, of course, with the reduction of costs as a target, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks are now able to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has reduced all plans of the global banking sector.
Sababell, in fact, will complete this year's Optima's management plan, which he established four years ago, although the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a longer period.
Customers who leave savings cash will be their main objective.
During a small lunch organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcedental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will be slow.
Moreover, in two or three years this will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he believes that the war of the passive - which penalises the margins - is reducing, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashiers pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity is already moving to the credit price to compensate for the collapse of the margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't close the robinnet, but the differences are higher," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differences - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also noted that the banking sector's trend is now "to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The Saturday's management plan is based on organic growth even though the group does not, as always, eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "we will ask for greater dimensions."
"It's all going to happen next year," he said.
He claims that capital needs "greatly increase" and some Spanish financial entity could enter red numbers.
It also states that FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
It indicates that it cannot be issued, but on the contrary of what happened in June, it can be obtained from short-term funding through rest, which waits for the crisis.
The ECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the boxes
The Director-General of ECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings and insisted on the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the Spanish savings fund concentration process began, several entities were assured that they were not going to take part in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECA), José Antonio Olavarrita, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been made, it cannot be said that the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we are 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, which has also worked very closely in this operation," the manager stressed.
In a small-day statement by the Aragón Directors and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta showed that the concentration process is "as soon as possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain", he was impressed.
"The transition of 45 cashes with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unprecedented process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger in order to comply with Bále," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowdown of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and meaning," because "the Bank of Spain is reminded that it must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director-General of ECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, made sure yesterday that Spain has the most severe financial system of all Europe and the "probably" of the world and has assigned it to those who doubt it as a "inconsistencies of knowledge".
The manager mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings cashiers, a system that has begun a "very important" concentration process and "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has established conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adaptation methods, which included tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of 426 euros without professional contributions to the privatization of 49 per cent of AEA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of State Lotiers.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, agrees with the criteria of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility to detect the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks it to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, in Germany it is becoming more specific on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of Mark, although it now seems to be fictional science, with a very favourable current of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary hardship, amendments to countries that go beyond them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and this has long been defined, so there is no room for excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission had stimulated the deficits, the German Government had designed a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax relief plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second time of the Central European country was when Merkel was difficult to extend the decision to save Greece.
Since then it has been the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the public were against the withdrawal of Greece.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to enable the withdrawal of a country and at the same time obliged private creditors to support part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
However, its proposal, although somewhat uneducated, has been approved, and we should be involved in the Union reform process which makes these measures possible since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she doesn't think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we can't be too agreed, since that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be obliged to make a statement on termination of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also support part of the costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a serious growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumer moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external sales.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with enormous losses in the balance of payments, such as the one that preceded Spanish growth in the years of the tree, will not simply be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
This is not just to redefine the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace.
And that we can take advantage of the opportunity we have given us until the spring of 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the last Saturday meeting with the large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that despite Merkel's criticisms, we have opened the way to the theme that we must order the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities to be considered, it cannot be excluded from leaving an overcrowded monetary area of less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sports and fraud of the law
The Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show their zeal but not their willingness to escape to a penalty.
The initial expulsion by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match against Ajax on November 23 in the League of Champions has led to a great deal of confidence in the anti-sportif nature of such behavior and whether the two players should be punished by the EAFRD.
As we know, a few minutes before the match was finished (which their team had already won clearly), the two players deliberately lost their time when they made mistakes to determine the verdict to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will be the leader of its group, the two players will carry out the regular punishment during the next match of the baring match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons at the next phase.
Finally, the EAFRD Disciplinary Committee punished with two matches the team's coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice but rather common in the football world.
It is so obvious that it is part of the ethics, non-written rules, but follow this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the related case due to the fact that this had been a prominent team of the real Madrid entity (which in its hymme shows nobleness and honour and in the past has condemned its players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Murinho, which adds an additional episode to its history of historical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether such behaviour is expressly prohibited by the regulation contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether such acts are a violation of the law, because they are, in fact, actions that are relevant to the sport regulation but appear to be exaggerating its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, a aspect that has not been threatened by these actions, that is, there has been no violent game.
Another of these assets to which the right game is allusioned is to avoid that the criminal player team is unjustly benefiting from the opposite team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not agree that it is usually characterized as a crime or a fraud of the law, because its violation of rules has not been made in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has clearly tried to be as evident as possible to receive the sentence.
They waited and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders get from the wrong intentions under consideration.
It seems necessary here to note that we are not in a situation of disadvantage to rivals and there is no benefit in the same match no more, since of course the result of the action is the fact that they leave their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match no more, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the League of Champions without cartoons that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, because the team could be completely eliminated at the same time and on the other hand, with this action the players perform a penalty match and pass into the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with less than one in the first cycle.
So, recording the scales isn't so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which is why even part of the strategic decision-making that promotes benefit as far as the rules allow.
In our case, players have not acted to avoid the application of the penalty (that would be a clear case of fraud of the law), nor have they chosen the time at which they submitted themselves to it.
They have taken a strategic decision without enjoying impunity or being away from it.
Although the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is wide, on this occasion I think there has been a clear case of genius.
Poliemic seems to me to be due to two factors: there were two auto-expulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Infringement of bids to capture Christmas dates for groups in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship focuses this year on a reserve range of 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tour and lotteries, when December comes, there are also groups dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but because of the crisis, you are in an offensive price adjusted to catch most customers: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros a day or a meal, bringing together businessmen and associations from the sector.
In order to complete the accounting process, the calendar of this year (such as the night of St. Sylvestre falls to Friday) concentrated on applications during the week of 13 December, resulting in a round of daily reservations for the few days (the 17th and the 17th of December) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated collective income for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own taxes.
In any case, they are all asking for combat prices, confirmed by the President of Gremi de Restoration de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The employer's representative cannot now predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will well be "for those who give good price and with good service", he adds, and he recalls that customers tend to downplay the crisis, so that the cuts around 25 euros have become majority in demand.
In a survey in several centres of the centre, there is a breakdown of applications for the night of 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine boom of applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, which they responded by adapting their menus to the future, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the particularity of the calendar was further anticipated, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices for last year, with menus for all the tastes of 1995 to 30 euros," they explain.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, maintains optimism after detecting an exorcism from the second season and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The Group's sources state that 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
In their six group menus they added one per Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a provision to spend 10% more than last year than to require more details, such as the Catalan wine manufactured according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also saw the first improvement signs in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the side of the patronate Fecasarm (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomá, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that reservations are globally "lived", even if customers "exploratory".
This is true, the hope regarding festivals has not fallen, regardless of who pays it, indicates it.
Pakistan ' s nuclear programme generates a great deal of concern to the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks' filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the clear and well-known details on the content of the talks and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreased" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not collected but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in case of attack - is one of the main concerns in Washington.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, also listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under the Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials, which is short-lived and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is being considered, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has the responsibility of recruiting personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear programmes or missiles," said expert Yuri Korolev, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistan ' s nuclear weapons production.
An Ambassador's delegation in May, who qualifies as "frustant" the communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is often lacking; aid offers remain unanswered or eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian National Intelligence Officer, notes that "Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" the officer that "the Pakistani Army must end with the support of the terrorist groups".
In the case of the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count on a high responsibility for the counter-terrorism fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to follow the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it's not new, but it's dated November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the recent filtering of more than four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
The 20 international police bodies in Lyon (France) ordered the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday after receiving authorization from the authorities of the country.
Thus, 188 Interpol countries have received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, according to the organization's explanations, consider the network call as a free way of arrest -- that the police's national body should make - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England where Assange is thought to be.
The movement prompted lawyers from Assange, who yesterday published a letter condemning the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks's video conference to answer questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"It seems to be a trap, not a legal persecution," the journalist laments.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to be found in an unknown place, but he wasn't.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the Director of Time magazine via Skype, where he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to American diplomats to the United Nations by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was challenged yesterday by the press secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" the application for resignation.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a website should interest us," he said to the CNN.
Obama himself has been charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new flight of documents.
President Barack Obama's oral attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have proclaimed these days.
Peter King, the congressman who has since January presided over the National Security Committee in the Lower House, asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate their funds and continue to provide them with contributions or assistance".
More far away, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's adviser, Stephen Harper, went back on his statements after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should transform it into a target and use an aircraft without equipment or something similar."
A person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possibly a candidate for the presidency.
"The person in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be a very nice punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eye-clints for Cardot's adapters
The President of the Republic will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more pluralist executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the first internal revolution within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of decommissioning is not sufficient for former leader Joseph Lluís Cardo-Rovira's followers, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as intense as his liar and that it can’t give him any headaches as he had with other extended currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyeglasses that allow him to be blind to municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ECE consultants would be able to speak about its continuity in secret.
By means of ballot papers, not in front of your hand.
If the carodists want to take a certain vote of punishment to the President, they can do it without fear of repressives.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgaria" would be no longer good.
The people close to Cardod require the President to put his position on military service, a gesture that is of no value when Puigcercós controls the largest body among the congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force decommissioning, they will try to make an executive board of road until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the Board will vote on the National Council at 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to program the conference for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The ERC leader warned that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make it possible once for all the organization to wash its living room in the family.
In this line, the article that current adviser Joseph Huguet signed in his blog is a symptomatic result.
In view of Puigcercós's ideology, the Innovation holder thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five, which he highlights two.
The first is "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90 per cent of the military, i.e. new figures from the CAROD adaptive sector.
The second can be the character of a big new one.
Huguet proposes that the ERC is liquid once for all of the assembly as a operating mechanism.
It therefore advocates a reform of the Statutes that enables Congresses to be carried out through elected delegates by torture.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Concrete Convolutation led to the revision of the Assembly model at a specific convention on the reform of the Statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal marriage in recent years has not recommended addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors of waste, the time could be good for recovering and closing it forever.
23 executions in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILLION of the State of Mexico, a decline in 4 cases was recorded in 2010 compared with 2010.
In November 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILLENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut into the Gulf of Mexico.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, town of Toluca.
The subject had at least three bursts of fire and a drop of thanks to the head, along with the legs and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the port of a vehicle abandoned in the Mixtecas street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Very early in the morning, on the fourth day, the owners of land exploited together found a body with signs of torture and at least three layers of lethal fire in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan of the Hall, in the sector crossing the Villa Guerrero municipality.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was killed with eight shots of fire when he left his house to start his collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by an impact of fire on their heads in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the edge of a fire in the front, a man's body was found on a lonely road by Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet hit by a 25-calibre fire weapon.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the Black Water Canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the members of the body, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a body located in Peña Colorado, the hands attached behind it and the eyes bound.
The man had a wound caused by a knife of fire in his neck.
In the middle of the month, two men who had been involved in coverts and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of Villas de la Hacienda department in the city of Atizapán in Zaragoza were found at the same time with the victims of two death warning messages.
A day later, a carton containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony it was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th cover, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of Ixtapaluca and the following morning were located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been involved in a yellow and blue cover, in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left behind.
In Ixtapaluca, with gun cuts of fire in the core, it was found the body without the life of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Aquautla.
On the woman's skin, she was detected from Santa Morete's tattoos and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found on the side of a car in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impact and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed by a criminal organization, which said: "That's what happens to those who don't agree."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with attached hands and feet, two bodies were found inside a taxi left behind at the San Agustin Center of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had been disabled in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been involved in black plastic bags, attached to a canal rub and a message on the side; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a bridge with a message.
China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of this country in COP16 has ensured that its country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon trace and has kept its supply low by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, provided Su Wei, representing this country to COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei made sure that her country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, it has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been recorded in all these areas, including last year's approval, of a new Energy Act, which recognises the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, explained it.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy savings goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, it stated that there are various ongoing or completed multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese Government and by the Governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial project of climate change, another for the change of fire-ignition lamps by economic lamps and another attenuation and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of this country on climate change, made sure that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, it showed that the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of its historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and is planning to do another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national director of PAN has explained that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission.
The national director of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos was legalized and that the former Panist leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission.
In his previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagado as a state governor, he said that the expulsion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a claim to the National Council's Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he made it clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidate.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action National would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December internal elections where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a aspect that has never been on the negotiating table at least for now, was an approach for local elections that had succeeded and achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; rather, "we are samurai and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the Council would no doubt be able to choose the best leader whose National Action is needed for the next three years, so it would give rise to "the person determined by the Council."
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of President of the Party to any of the five."
He provided that the party's resignation to the 4 July elections will be reflected in the next debate, although "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For now it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that issue alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the trap and will be a cause of observation throughout the country, so that "there is so much hope for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the top of expectations".
When he was asked about the criticisms of PRI against President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prizers to reflect on the six years of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that they're out of love," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive could make statements such as those he had in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gambling in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promises on Twitter the law for students without papers
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legislate students without papers, with a message in his personal account on the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its short message now opens a cybernetic link with a broader document that requires the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote for legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we expect soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was made public after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the tax reductions in the Bush era and the funding of the Government continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
In connection with the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs stated that he was confident that once the tax problem was resolved, a agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we've got a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this sense and then we can plan the rest of the sequence," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "exclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legislate undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even though it would probably be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the Act of the United States of America would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and stayed in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the participants need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need to compete with a large number of Republicans, at times when the protagonist project's organizations are intensive lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against it and only one Republican voiced his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the participants in the Dream Act need the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the shortest Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who completed his mandate as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who has supported him, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the shower on the beach
The second stage of the language Players was a walk in which participants made the drawing of the narrative.
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the shower on the beach? what do you expect from me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the language’s Artists, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and which used the subtitles of her question (for another time the round table was dedicated to the language, she explained).
The shower on the beach" ...we put it in the barras" slowly launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who were gathered at the International Forum of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to hear this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plaie" is, she goes from a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only from the tracks in the same narrative series.
From the infectiologist she turns out to be convinced: "The patience isn't my strength, it may be my pleasure."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath into the center of the color, but who explains to him that the beach is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the beach is what is really open, the symbol is the scarcity".
The protagonist sighs and concludes: "On the beach I have only been able to know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but he is convinced that the pleasures and parts of the language must be closely linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating narrative that he entitled Eloge to the invention, where the shower on the beach is not designated but at a given time it is discovered.
With the touch of magical realism, he spoke of a famous unsorned cloud-crowding people who had gone away or repaired verts that a lady-in-law had lost, a narrative that turns to speak about America, the great new one that had since the beginning of her own chroniclers and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the over-narrations of the victorious Captains.
"Servants who invented all of us (the writers) were deceived by false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise we would never have told the story of America with an idea that was missing even from power."
However, he stressed that "the fools and liars have the best idea" and here the reality is converging with the lie, we don't know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apologetic.
It's actually called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It's due to its legacy that we are what we are counting on."
In turn, writer Mayra Monterero announced and praised the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The right to the beach.
Cuba-Portoricaine has given its attention to the great scourge of social violence that her country has experienced - and Latin America shares - resulting in disputes over traffic and drug sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry and good songs are a silent commitment which is not necessarily predicated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "this must be on the bed of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that is very fast also in terms of intellectual customs and control of consciences that turn to the benefit of dogmas, "there is a small non-participation behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be teachers of our own feelings and to be teachers of the reality, we need to dance: and dancing means many times putting the shower on the beach and making people feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, white and black, in established ideas and nuanced ideas and also the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting people to get the sense of writing.
Romano on his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defects in his finals he had high and low in his career, but he had reached three times the decisive series.
With the sadness of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are more than two different styles that are faced, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defects in the finals, he had high and low in his career, but he has reached three times the decisive series, although he has not so far put in the thousand and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
Argentina ended up consoled with the sub-scheme medal, he remained behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The sensitistic strategy came to its first end as an coach in the Open Tour 2002 when he held the ranks of Morelia with which he lost a total score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in Closure 2003 he also reached a decisive duel and lost again with the total result of 3-1 and was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentenary Tour 2010, once again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a relapse because his team had a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game, but in the series of fines he received a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players were 11 meters away and he suffered defeat as a result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Dioblos Rojos and one with Monterey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same luck, he tries to detach himself from the evil so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that the institution is more important to him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," commented the Timonir when he was asked what his points would be at the end.
He remembers a lot of the last one, which he makes sure he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold is that until the adbit doesn't touch the end, we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, the players too, because the last time, with two pins to draw us were already ready to run, and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concern him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish at a regular time, but sometimes we are not prepared, the previous round has been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title between our hands, but it has saved us, it has served as a lesson for this final situation and we hope that we will no longer get there."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a champion technician and enjoy for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People have to go to the Visa Applicants Service centres before their interview in the Consular Section; waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the procedure for the processing of visas to the Ambassador and Consulates of the United States will be changed.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to be present at the Visa Enquiries Service Centres (ASC, according to their centuries in English) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will provide some benefits for the aspirators, including the following:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get a date, another payment for the visa processing and another payment for the e-mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visas with a request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas should not have an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only be presenting themselves to the ASC where they will present the documents and they will be taken into consideration.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants wishing to meet a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less time than before.
Also, visa applicants for the Juárez City Consulates, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra duty rate of $26.
For more information on the new procedure to request the visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/voletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency has quoted the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living in space.
The U.S. National Administration of Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow morning at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrology, science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA ensured that it would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were incapacitated and would allow us to become intelligent as humans if our conditions of life improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, which lives in an environment where it was thought too late for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any way, creation uses the arsenic as a way of life and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our favorable atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will communicate the actual amount of discoveries at the tomorrow press conference.
At the conference, geobiology will participate in Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite in Saturn), with the view that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
opposed PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible.
The 60th was to be installed when the Congress appeared to be an opposition block led by MPs of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four were asking one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the 60th legislative installation session, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezekiel Reynsoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonate' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, since there are now two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four Members, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only to vote against the Director chaired by PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme by means of a political will and if they did not, they would be re-examined by the two parties and thus the opposition coalition would end.
"To this end (the opposition coalition) is what I think, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, de Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are contradictions and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that after being monopolistic, or now "duopolistic".
"This is not the spirit of reform of the law that has an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group begins with 5 legislators and now talks to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has been enough.
Ezequiel Reynsoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress is now transformed into a 'butin' between two, with an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one part, now they divide it into two."
Mr. Montalvo asked to respect the candidate's personality, to give him his place in the negotiating tables.
"If they do not leave out of co-operating agreements outside 5 which are likely to be 9 Members, now that we see, separated from different groups, we have decided to join us to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have, they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Marie de Mazatlán pays another check on the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another 200-mile weight check for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by Mary.
In addition, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles of weight.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 weights, as "supplier account liquidation".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Supreme Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and will therefore be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We haven't bought anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs have "reapparu" the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Law when an undertaking is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July, Noroest had published a review of the checks issued by Marie to her suppliers, revealing that in the March 2008 period - July 2010, in the thirty-first year of Maaire Jorge Abbel López Sánchez, the town of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pounds, over 42 Czechs.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, covering more than 3 million weight checks.
Tourist sites should be cared for
Tourists regret the accident of a foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sanchez Taboada Round Point in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a cross-point Sanchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zone Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of destination be taken care of and that new activities should be replaced by others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trucks affected the tourist movement and they saw the disorder and avoided close trade.
"Politics don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, or they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and entertainment on the part of Marie.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid it again, how to do so, so it has been through preventive maintenance and not only to correct it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a city itself, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and Mary must change her strategy for the sake of the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, as the tourist comes, it does not depend only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has its own property in its beaches, boulevards, permanent entertainment of tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that is known to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary for Tourism Promotion, stated that the recovery of the tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and design a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be lined up with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, ordered and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Mazatlán is happy to offer many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned and lined up to make them attractive so that they can be added to the inventory that we have to promote this destination."
IIP request for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
The Mazatlán business sector requires a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Last year the 60th legislation was set up by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, total of 40 people.
The list of expectations that new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of spirit of party or patriarchalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
"We hope that MPs are actually exercising their right, free of agreement between parties, because the custom is that they make agreements to protect their own interests and become the carnival mask of rulers and leaders of parliamentary groups."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that make the current Governor's progress.
"We will ensure that they are working decently and particularly committed to society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their voice of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of 40 popular representatives is to encourage and add forces to seek the economic growth of the State, as the economic situation is currently very complex.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in turn stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators attach its importance to the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is inextricably an important economic activity that generates currency and investment and which directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help ensure the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
Looking for king magic
Peoples, cars and bicycles, among other games, are the desire of children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to carry out their illusions, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desired.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live daily because their father has no stable job.
"It's sometimes very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and after noon I go out with 'pples' to sell in the street," said Cayeta Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of children.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a doll.
In his turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long dreamed of having a 'trick monster' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayeta suggests size clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'were, my son' because he was very cute'," he recalls with sadness Cayeta.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, threw the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, threw the size 10, while Michael, 8 years old, threw the size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five-and-a-half-six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, giving a game or money to receive Noroeste.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen investigations were carried out in Austria, Wednesday, as part of the demining of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Forty people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The investigations were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hasschich, money and equipment for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two leading heads assumed of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Persons arrested should be compared to the Sherbrooke Court of Justice in the hours following their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession in order to carry out traffic, complex and service flights, among others.
These investigations were carried out following a long-lasting investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"This is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Security of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Region participated in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The draft law of conservators who, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine migrants would be evident when the three opposition parties knew Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I have a debate with a party who created the granite under your feet," said Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals claim that the proposed draft law, which would allow for up to one year everyone from a ship identified as transporting clandestine migrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the draft law because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all parties to the opposition are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the backlog of the criticisms that her part was not strong enough about clandestine immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against clandastin passengers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives Bill because it takes refugees and holds children in custody for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a pallasson."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could have led the country to elections resulting from its rejection.
However, a conservator told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who would object would then appear before his voters.
The new unit does not make unity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea does not exist yesterday: Québec would have consulted New York's Department of Investigation on this matter since January last.
Metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the morning announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was never discussed at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for public security criticism, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad of "labin out of a hat" and "British solution on the edge of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, please say it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the introduction of a public investigation.
"More Mr Charest refuses to create this investigation committee, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to deplore Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisver, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
In order to stem from this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the verifier General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Québec could give the verifier the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to be obliged to testify.
The creation of a permanent skeleton is not the only project in the Charest government's cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would be sent by the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed to him that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently referring to certain amendments to this matter.
During the Printemps 2001 operation, which attacked the murder groups, although the criminal code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently adopted the Gangsterism Act.
High-supervised rivers
Several water courses remain under high surveillance due to strong precipitation which has been attacked in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another blast would occur in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There's a road down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong precipitation has taken place in several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected to last night, according to the regions.
The sectors in the north of the river and in the Ouhuaai valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of total rain.
As these precipitations must be added to the source of the already accumulated snow in some sectors, several water courses are feared.
Warnings of flooding were issued Wednesday night by Quebec Civil Security for the Oueau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The North Rivers, Saint-Jerôme, the Laurents, and the Chenea, in Lotbinary, were the subject of flood protection and would remain under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitations led to the demarcation of certain lakes in Saint-Juliane, Saint-Marcellin-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was transported because of heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated in a preventive manner.
In Outauaai, the demarcation of certain lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The Civil Security remains on a alert and monitors the situation near, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Québec Cross Prediction Centre issued Wednesday for its part strong warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, The Assomption, Oueau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blame dupont
Québec's radio animator Stéphane Dupont referred to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial issues on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its heavy language in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of them contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, indisputable negative representations of Haitians and gross language that did not fit in the broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who have committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
CNCR received several complaints regarding comments made during the 2008-2010 broadcasts.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of the Social Assistants of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid information rather than counterfeiters.
With regard to suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had assumed that suicide is a left-hand gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes caused by "Dubont the Midi" have addressed a delicate issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
So no lead has been kept in its place.
The last argument was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort were then delivered to a media face that had caused many reactions.
CHOI's animator stated that he had done nothing to help the Haitians because we could not be sure that the people who needed the money would receive it.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect was an indisputable negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned up my suspension three days above."
"My case has been weird for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee condemns the dissemination of major languages.
In each case, radio transmitter CHOI-FM collaborated "outside its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, inter alia, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of large hearing within a period of three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian Montréalais of origin Nacerddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing mounts on the tatamis and rounds of the world to look for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for some battles everywhere, because for those who don't like the game in this field in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security officer and as a member of the UPS company has just released some bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"At present, I am ready to go to China for the Cup of the World of San Shou."
"The combatants who ended among the first four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth grade, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in each competition."
"In this rhythm, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sanda" is an original Chinese discipline where punch and foot cuts, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally appeared on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous puglilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most prominent and prestigious in China, explained the sympathical gallery."
"It's a little equivalent to the Lumpinee City (the largest city in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in half of its category (80 kg), before losing it.
"The one who won me was a real pro, he analyzed it."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are faced at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category are made to run one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has provided $450 million in loans to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this 100 contract, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor firms that has obtained the most important, the project's management, for a total of $295 million without a bid.
This Consortium called Energy Guarantee was established in 2004 in a consistent manner in choosing Hydro-Québec to entrust its private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Consortium Energie Energie Energie was awarded the lucrative contract without calling for public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate associations poses a serious ethical problem that is likely to eliminate competition and cause price increases.
"It's the new way to get rid of fraud and deal with competition."
"It is that people, instead of doing this in secret, now the source of openness," said Pequiste Commissioner Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded after noon, and there was no strong conclusion to this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she complained, arguing that the PQ had been "unfaithful" and had "no difficulty."
She said, "That would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a current practice around the world.
This is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity taking into account the scope of the work.
The building is underway and must be expanded until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition; there was negotiations.
Also, the form of consortiums is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As was revealed last week in Le Debor, the form of consortiums in the General Council sector is the subject of an investigation into the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows for more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau firm works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, is bound to one and even a moral person, either Dessau.
As for the Energy Guarantee Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec has been particularly responsible since the 1970s".
The main owner of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that the project security contract was granted free of charge.
"If you call offers and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people in this market and what you say, we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Consortium Energy Guarantee is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, The Debor had 109 gene council contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including land laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin signed 22 contracts, Geneva received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting its participation in Energy Security.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the security energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard agreed that the four firms that make up the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let the PQ also be linked to these firms that "finance it" before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Consumer Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but sceptical.
The Cuban consumer is very lacking in confidence with sustainable development actors, but also with fair brands and eco-certificates to guide his or her choices.
Pis, even though he runs into a media universe where messages for a more responsible pollutant consumption are due to a lack of credible information, because he does not even qualify as a brake for his commitment, states the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecese seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as in the green advertising of companies, they reveal the measure tool developed by the Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke.
In other words, half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates based on the said fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be excessive, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' talks on this topic are taken seriously by only 14.6 per cent of Quebecese.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this bread of consumption currently being used by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the empty and suspicious nature of the information would ease down 46 per cent of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecese say that they are so negative about the alleged performance of green products or services that they are sought to be put between their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 having changed their habits and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At 61 per cent, they also promoted purchases from traders in their district and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 over a maximum of 100 for this year - , Quebec's consumed Homo prefers to be presented as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental impact by worrying about the protection of animals.
However, her social and environmental conscience seems to remain outside her car, says the Barometer: in 2010, at least 28 per cent of Quebecers indicated that they had used transport in common or had preconceived transportation to defend their green interests.
The march and the bike were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first click.
A State loan for the eXcentris race
The Government of Quebec, to which it was asked to commit financially to the collection of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus and the Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate but only in competition with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, which would expect a gift of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent by handing him back his full Cunephilic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The Government agrees to be involved in the case, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would otherwise be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least from the opinion of the sources of State offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec on the last spring, but requests have been reviewed since then.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, which is piloting the eXcentris case.
He made a final report to him about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal arrived at SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to answer.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the State's gift must really be eliminated.
We recall that the Québec film and cinema owners' Association opposed direct investment by the State in support of the eXcentris harvest, arguing that the Ministry of Culture is not to fund real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
However, several environmental actors called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the director of the scene for ten years wore the author's film in his complex premises after he had financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the treasurer's Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is emerging in Montréal, and eXcentris had its clientiles.
The Angus and the Parallel Society, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, is a private financing campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the acquisition route.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Paralleléle, continues to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The purpose of the future buyers is to open the three rooms on February 27th by projecting the very beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember The Debor and we ignore what he and his group think of the low proposals made to them.
The wave rises up on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed light on what the United States considers to be the minimum of Canadians against the Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of superior to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector did not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009.
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located on the public ground yesterday, provide more detail than material to be placed under the teeth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, or in full federal electoral campaign, relates to how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of US ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"A Canadian minority complex almost inherently conditioned may be Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the day rather than making this election on the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), he wrote. "
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverb exhilarating of this election: they are universal, but potentially too dangerous to talk about".
The ambassador is less aware of this "serious silence" than the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Legally, it considers that the capacity of a candidate, of a party and more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The other expression of this importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, in charge of works in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the February federal budget vote, by which Canada will show its first deficit over a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion pension plan," wrote Mr. Breese.
No party mentioned that the Government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being confused by the coalition and that opposition parties had to make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed relief plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the more negative picture than the dramatic series broadcast to the CBC sent to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, where reference is made to minor references to Maher Aar, "No-Fly-List" or to CIA muscle questionnaires.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to host some of Guantánamo's prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "cases by case".
At the end of the meeting, it was written, "he sent a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the case."
We note finally that the spirits are exhausted with regard to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the responsible for this massive flight should be "killed".
It was Mike Huckabee's act in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
The United Nations proposed to Cancún yesterday a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) corresponding to almost three thirds of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planetary climate of 2020.
This ambitious plan is set out in the series of major projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to the plan of yesterday, if the fuel pumps that are still monopolized by 50 to 70 per cent of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electroluminescent diode ampoules (DEL or "LED"), the amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet for human enlightenment would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will need to be removed from this balance 5 Gt to stabilize the climate from 2020 to 2 centigrade degrees in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In fire pumps, 95% of the energy disappears in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluocompact ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75 per cent and with new DEL ampoules, this energy demand is again reduced twice.
Fluocompact ampoules last between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
New Ampoules to DEL, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumed 80% less energy than an incandescent ampoule, giving an idea of the economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with rehestats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have shown reservations about fluocompact ampoules because they contain mercury and need to be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place supplies.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but rather the thermal coal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce gas-pleasant electricity in fire pumps.
In the United States alone, these centres issue 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of electoral results in the nervous state
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the publication "without time" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay, has stressed a spokesman from the Head of the United Nations."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to prove their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the Wednesday evening to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's trial.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the period, the Chairman of the ECI said on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Appeals have multiplied worldwide so that CEI finally announces the name of the winner of the second round between Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, is based on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "frouble" votes in the north, taken into account by the ex-rebellion of the new Forces (NF) since the fall of the missing State in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, presidential campaign director of Ivorian President, said that the UN electoral intimidation works in the north of the country had challenged the president's supporters to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were maintained by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political alliance of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a North man who left all ties with the ex-rebelliouss, judged the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until the victory was over.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had complained before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency on Sunday was intended to mark the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained fragmented for two years.
The United Nations strongly warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished his first tour on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropole (9.7% in overseas departments), showing adjusted seasonal variations (CVS) provisional data published by the Insea.
The number of trucks is 2,631 million in metropole.
The second quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the population active in metropole and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate is up to 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in Metropolitical France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for employment or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated, with a new rise in unemployment rate, with 24.2% in metropole (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were under the age of BIT.
Adults have known for their part a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4 per cent in metropole (+0.2 points in three months and one year), 482,000 people over 50 years or more, and 6.6 per cent with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter, to 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polemy on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) on Tuesday in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini was examined and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was examined and found at the Lyons arrest house near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guérini was examined for the abuse of social goods, for money and for public goods, for theft, for active corruption, for traffic in influence and for the detention of ammunition, and indicated his lawyer.
"Alexander Guerini is a fighter and tends to explain all the questions that the Master will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to continue for a multitude of repudiative leaders, it's another thing to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, a strong man from the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, told the judge to pass a memo before his hearing to explain himself.
One of her neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also interviewed at Wednesday night and believed.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to make the downloads he had to handle.
As for the allocation of markets or the allocation of funds related to their operation, he has never had any knowledge of them, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Agglomeration Services of Aubagne, was examined Wednesday for the deterioration of public funds and complexity, and was released under judicial control with a ban on meeting the prosecutors of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations about the facts that are being denied to him."
"The instructor's teacher took into account not the private lack of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Wednesday night, with a seat under judicial control for two of them, indicated the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for the Property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued for "influence and passive corruption".
Two staff members of the Auglomation of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bingier are considered one for "substration and diversion of public goods by a person responsible for a public service mission", the other for "complexing of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "the abuse of social goods".
Among the people facing Mr. Guerini is Stephen Brunengo-Girard, recently involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets involving the Corse.
Investigators suspect their companies to be using the money of big banditism.
The investigation was carried out in the context of several legal information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for fraud alleged in the passage of public markets, particularly in the waste series.
From a close source of the investigation, research focuses on the conditions of the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in haleine in France, placed the diplomat on alert, and emphasised the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the care of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal some of the consequences of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, giving them advice on dealing with their own "tages" crises in Iran (a small group of ransomers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not taken place to combat the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American law for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they are pleased with a light across the way the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to believe that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram published on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostages".
Elysée's adviser to strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Orsay Quai for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is in line with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They encourage Americans to do so in order to repatriate their own retired settlers in Iran.
"Acts of the trumpet," they say, "martheless" in the media the words "rights of fundamental man", "innocentness", "immediate freedom".
He needs it to take over the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to his image.
"Do it as much as the Iranians ask you not to do."
Because, after attempts to discuss by discreet channels, "silence will rule nothing", Iranians are "masters in dilatory works".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for political singing".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss's prison (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when she fled to France's embassy) "will require payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he knows that Elisée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
Iranians could "in a near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
One information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, the United States which claims extradition for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released to Paris on a decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, asks about this disturbing coincidence.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a marketing?
The release of Iran from France?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the guards of the scenes" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government can't come back to the decision," he observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "secretity" supervision of French information services.
Elysée's adviser consists of a telephone number, accommodating, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisée does not house her efforts, through communications and "flights" organized in the media, to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation brings its results because several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials".
On what is behind so much "gratitude" expressed against Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is requested.
"Despite their full statements of praise, the French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then focuses on the reasons why Elysée was forced to pay for this fiction.
The intention of communication "to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria", he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immigrated".
By "expressing the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what rewards it can play by playing a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "seam the seeds of dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows the source.
On August 11, François Richier told him, "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything about it."
"But we thanked them at the same time."
"It should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss entered France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it from Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last night
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "from Cendillon" that will prevent teenagers from playing online after-minute games by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under 16 years of age, indicated representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Department responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be available again at 6 p.m.
Societies will have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, it has specified.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games for young people whose parents are applying for it, adding the responsibility.
It will also make available to people who claim free software that can limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the inconsistencies of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates the host countries
In full turmoil due to corruption suspicions, the Fifa Executive Committee will designate the world Cup host countries 2018 and 2022, a very political choice where influence and lobbying are likely to take the step on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa's queen competition will take place in Europe, traditional discipline bastion (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to win new territories (Qatar, Australia), after the first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Middle East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's empress, Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) addresses the economic and political issues of a World.
The treatment in coulises is therefore likely to last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (18) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be too serious for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football field that only once welcomed the World in 1966.
The BBC sent a cover, Monday, by broadcasting a documentary that inspires three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What a pleasure to Fifa and put the English officials in the barracks, who have been launched in an intense lobbying these last few weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The Head of Government hopes to re-establish the success of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who was awarded in 2005 for the JO-2012 organization in London.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to reverse the collapse of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spanish-Portuguese duo is not lacking at all with its already ready stages, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could serve their ambitions.
The possible reflections against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (states, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and declared "delegate competition in the preparation of the vote" in an allusion to the English press charges against EC members.
"When they're covered, they're trying to compromise them," said Mr. Putine.
For 2022, the United States, strong in the 1994 experience, appeared as the logical benefits.
The first world economic power, based on the main sponsors of the Fifa, seems to have a long way ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidates appeared premature for two countries that co-organised the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the release of the World 202026 to China, which was deliberately desired by the Fifa, would actually lead to the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has played a major role in proposing future stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion towards new opponents, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquired (due to time-consuming) by European countries, the nerve of the Fifa war.
Second mandate: evidence
Of Gaulle was really upset.
Mitterrand had thought he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the least tension.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
A mandate to the Elysée calls it another.
So the current Head of State will be applied in 2012.
However, the evidence does not make a good home with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it must be as if there were always doubt.
In a sense like in another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that he would take his decision "some part of the autumn of 2011".
As he referred to UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in Elisée, the view of "two mandates" was therefore somewhat fragility.
Was it the official announcement of his application?
We were far away.
The President simply recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of fifties to two years.
He was making a statement, not an ad.
This is not the first time he mentioned the president, on the tone of the light at such meetings.
"The worst, or the best, you've had it for seven and a half years with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelle in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the next stage."
Its matters before yesterday do not make her more candidate than she does; they do not make her less.
If they raise comments, that's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the course to the application to the PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the entry into the face of Ségolène Royal which makes Nicolas Sarkozy go away.
On the contrary, its 2012 candidate is clear that many in the PS claim an order of war earlier than planned.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidate to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP above," said the Prime Minister's round-up immediately and tactfully.
"If he believes the defect is possible, he won't be a candidate," writes Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"I will always believe I can win," corrected Alain Juppé, referring to evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to keep its securities purchases
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to specify the procedures for the issue of the crisis or at least to announce the conclusion of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis will no doubt not allow the Frankfurt Emission Institute to be as peremptive as it is to worsen a situation than it is today on European mandatory markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example, by increasing its sovereign debt purchase programme.
"I reserve my mind to my European partners (...) "
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament at its hearing in Brussels, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer aware of his intentions, pleased to point out that the purchase of State securities on the secondary market was "continuous" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main managerial rate changed to 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB have doubled last week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' instructions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have bought 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, there is no doubt about the prospect of a procurement investigation (see page 29).
The economists are no longer waiting for a significant change of mind.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, this last procedure is still subject to limited liquidity allocations under general conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this provision to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's making important changes in her program."
"This would not be the risk of creating new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commercialbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," he predicted by Norbert Brams, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations in order to encourage an innovative market," adds Norbert Brams.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to replace himself at all prices in the absence of investors on the market and to do so in order to prevent the packaging of performance paid by the most fragile States," said an important mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are involved, the States will be more generous to reduce their wear, or to stabilize it.
The euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the two rounds
After a start of a week worrying about Italy, the situation was slowed down, yesterday, with the return of compulsory rates at 10 years.
A return to early peace.
At a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they had heard Julio Tremonti describe the situation as "unencryptable" and were waiting for a week-end "unforeseen", which the interested party then declined.
On Tuesday, the difference with the long German rates had reached the 210 base points record and the price of cover contracts against the risk of failure (CDS) was around 263 points, leading to a certain collapse in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "very concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Of course, its problem is the lack of growth and the loss of tax revenues that are associated with, putting the State at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review at the Senate table above 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From where the room of a new budget collector could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be taken," says Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate and the short and long term, because despite its important debt (19.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's requested stabilization efforts are less than those applied to other countries," notes OECD-led economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Members, resulting in what early elections could be held at the end of March.
There would then be a period of time conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde once again congratulated her on yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have still been shown Sunday night and night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary zone."
In any case, the holder registered yesterday at European State obligations has brought water to the government and the ECB's currency.
But we can't talk about a normalization start yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and visibility, particularly on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas believe.
More than "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this threat and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying their discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more widely, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also true of the meetings of the Group and the Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The ECB will meet today.
In the menu, the number of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market counter (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (ESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched an Asian tour of Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-oriented investors of the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the area.
The first EDF securities issue is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States entrusted Reuters to the agency that the United States would support any increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
First-line countries, Portugal and Spain are seeking structural reforms, including in the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
One and the other have every price to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding structural reforms that are necessary for lasting confidence.
In conclusion, European fundholders are concerned with the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign debt markets.
From the passage to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first developed the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an operator of the first European sovereign debt market, argue that an estimated EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism currently has EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has all the opportunities for careful consideration in European capitals.
Especially if the conditions of the market would prevail.
Negee and verglas: 24 orange surveillance departments
The negative episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and are likely to disturb some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and wetlands.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loire, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna have been added to 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordonne and Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, supported snow verses affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it is weakly snowed on the French Isle-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, point 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordone, Poitou and those in the Netherlands Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are significant enough to create traffic difficulties and disturb some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Gingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludéac.
The movement on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the genres who recommend that their vehicle be taken only if necessary and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was prohibited for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all car drivers to the greatest discretion on the roads and to adapt their behavior accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) asked air companies to cancel their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent to Orly due to future snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until tomorrow morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial scales
Since the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, billions have flown.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion for the Great Paris Metro, which must be built by the Great Paris Society.
In order to launch this GSP, the State has announced a 4 billion euro capital grant.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets part of its double loop financing.
Today, we end up with the first additions.
The Corrections Act 2010, which was examined by the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the arrangements for the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment of the Great Paris Society".
It is defined as "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exist "to modernise it, increase the product and affect this increase to the Great Paris Society".
How much would that cost?
I'm a mystery.
This is not listed in the text.
We're away from 4 billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are added to EUR 4 billion of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and contributed to the Great Paris Society in the near future and as far as the project is concerned," may be read in the statement of reasons.
The SGP does not find this shocking system.
"From the time we created recipes (the two taxes, ndrr), we can cover the studies in three years and then dig in the 4 billion after, and explain it."
"It will be included in the budget and shot at the fire and the measure."
The GDP estimates that 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the 4 billion promised are still missing subscribers, is likely to lead to a little slow debate in Parliament.
The first public meeting was held on 7 December.
Hunters and loyal spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal rather than the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and presupposes a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file is made up of a secret service (of any nation or nation) consisting exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi can only report what has been read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's left-wing character profile has long been for skitish material artists.
The rule that secret records should be made up only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work is repeated (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do indirect research (we don't know where to look for new ones on the missing), but because those who turn to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is Parisian, and Parisian (or limited spirit) the head of secret services (unless I know it, editor of Freedom), who feels that what he recognizes is true.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published last week.
So why did the revelations on these files do so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any cultivated person already knows that Ambassadors, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representations, have become spy centres.
Any film viewer knows this very well, and it's only by hypocrisy that we seem to ignore it.
However, the fact that it is publicly a violation of the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to put America's diplomacy under a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world brings an inevitable blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also, the scandal does not put both victims and "burrows" in crisis.
But let's go to the deep nature of what happened.
Wells, in Orwell's time, we could have conceived any power as a Big Brother who controlled every act of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully fulfilled since, in order to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction performed, the hotel visit, the bus stopped and so on, the citizen was to be the total victim of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the secrets of power can not escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be undirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elect as a citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power no longer retain its own secrets?
It is true, George Simmel has already told him that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret cannot never be disclosed); it is also true that any knowledge of the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it is relevant to the public domain; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets meant to take away all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm in Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did too much in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the States will no longer be able to place any limited information - this would mean publishing it on a display gathered along the street.
But it is also clear that with current technologies, it is not expected to be able to keep confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a Head of State moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my vision is based on science fiction and is therefore Roman, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who are discrepancies in uncontrollable journeys, not bearing only messages learned from heart or, above all, hiding the rare information written in the backyard of a wheelchair.
The information will be kept in a single copy of key-closed shots: in the background, the Watergate's spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now advanced in skull, i.e. recluses.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) had allowed film researchers to explore a film gradually, moving forward and backwards and discovering all the mount secrets, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow them to jump from chapter, i.e. by macroporations.
With high-speed trains, we leave Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, and the movements it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for the policy and communication techniques to return to horse-cars.
Last observation.
At other times, the press was trying to understand what was happening in the ambassadorial secret.
At present, these are embassies who request confidential press information.
Climate: how France doubles its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the respect for rapidly-blocked financing promises (such as fixed start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the great French beads are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has played a major role in convincing its partners of the reality of its commitment to fixed-start financing: a report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, major event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated in its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had dropped EUR 2.2 billion in 2010 and that it was on the right path to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional efforts are made without the destruction of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States in which France had blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and it has added 150 million over three years to finance fixed start-up.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous years or the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), and it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding" ...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
Still, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, considered that 1€ loan is equal to 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro given... In addition, it should be taken into account in its commitments rather than the cost of the loan to the country of interest (i.e. the equivalent of a rate of interest).
But France has nothing to do with this: it 'respects' its commitment to EUR 420 million by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% gifts (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so extensively.
Germany requires 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) respect their commitments with 100 per cent of donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union has put €1 to meet its commitment, France has only 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In summary, France, in its fast-start funding, has a double shock: on the one hand, on the evolution of action in time and on the other, on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it is possible to believe that it costs 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to be Bercy who has achieved arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give enough credit?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not fully due...
The chapter on early financing is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be more sand grain in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that won't be the case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could advance its discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): it will not be excluded from the issue of "additionality" or loan accounting.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to progress in the discussions.
Warning about pesticides collected by children
A 10-year-old child faces 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published by the Association of Future Generations (ex-Moving for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no significant statistical value in the light of the low number of samples analysed but are illustrations of the problem-treated", bought between July and September the food consumed in four meals and a day by a teenager in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fruits and fresh vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as franchises, were examined by laboratories seeking chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the assistance is: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancers and five certain cancer-class substances as well as 37 substances that can be treated as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is concerned," notes the Association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three have been present as certain cancers as well as nearly one-half of the residues likely to disturb the hormonal system.
The pump, imported from Brazil, which is intended for the study, presents traces of six chemical substances which are currently banned in France.
The same thing for Kenya's green sharks, including in the afternoon, which the study has detected traces of a potentially banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the barked stick, the trunk in the box, and even the bread bag and the gum Chewing were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the robinet, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chlorforms.
For dinner, the salmon starch was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the review of the plastic seat used to heat the bread at the micro-onde was not exclusive.
The final risk for the consumer of this "continent cocktail" "is likely to be underestimated", according to the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) Alliance has proposed "the emergency of the situation" to install a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in civilisation diseases".
In July a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) showed the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
