The women are looking forward to protecting the world!
On 27 days in the game against the women in the Netherlands, the Chinese forces were marched back to a city in the event of the victory of the two stations, finally at 3:1 p.m. and arrived at nine.
The World Cup is nearing its final voice, although it is waiting to be defended, in the face of Serbia ' s troops, China's women's age-old seclusion is inevitable.
With the two pre-combatants in the Netherlands, the Chinese women's race was as strong as ever, with 25:19,25:16 in front of the two cities, up to the third.
The number of women in the Netherlands has increased the number of attacks on the game, and China's troops have been struck by an explosion, and the number of girls has increased dramatically, and the failure has begun to increase, and finally 21:25 has been forced to return to a city.
After the race, the battalion also stated: " Third floor, because we have been mistaken, we have sent about eight minutes. "
Of course, it was not easy for the Dutch women's efficiency to do so, and it was difficult to prepare before the Chinese women's race, although it was lost, but everything was still under control, " and the forces were normal and the five were normal, so we told the military to be careful, " The Quangani said so.
Fourth, the troops are actively adjusting their position, often running through the fires of the attack, and the unit gets eight minutes and is very successful in fighting the team.
To date, only two rounds of 11 fighting have been left, although a Chinese woman's escape, although one hand has already touched the prize of the army, has indeed been warning Chinese women against the fight against the Dutch army: the more critical time it is, the more hard it will be to fight.
In another 27-day competition, the Russian and U.S. women's ranks were filled with five positions, and the United States Army was unable to take all three of them from its opponent, so that China's women's ranks could be secured as long as the three-thirds of the match against Poserbia.
All kinds of situations are facing developments that are beneficial to Chinese women.
However, although Serbia ' s largest number of positions of power are known, this does not mean that they would easily be sent to China by third parties.
From the current form of ambiguity, Serbia ' s troops have been largely without prizes, which means that they can " stand up " in the race against Chinese women " , put down the package to the full range of attackers, while China ' s back is full of pressure, and the situation is likely to arise.
In addition, the complementary Serbian army is not a sheep of the "departure" and, in its former role with the Dutch army, the 5th General War Department, Serbia II, finally turned its full sovereignty over the Netherlands's position at 3:2 and thus shows its depth of position.
Before the third phase of the game, the team also expressed its concern: " The big game is going to be very difficult, and we're going to have to be ready as soon as possible. "
Now that the line of defense has been broken, the competition has actually entered "the white phase " .
In fact, China's women's ranks are all on the counter, and only the final essential concerns are to see whether girls are able to take a normal level and free themselves at the competition.

On 24 September, "A boat ticket to see me" was held in the capital of Saukhi, where the remaining 100 disabled people from Sasha were invited to the East Asian e-mail and appreciated the bright light and celebrated the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the new China.
Most of the 100 persons with disabilities who participated in this activity were on the first post.
At 56 years of age, John was just a poor man who had little access to the door because of his lack of both legs.
He said: "This is the first time I've been sitting in the post office today, and I've been away from my precious old-fashioned shoes, I've got a deep sense of development, I've been so excited and I can't forget."
Volunteers from the City of Safari and the Blue Rescue Team provided a comprehensive range of services for disabled persons.
In particular, the service objectives of the body are severe, and volunteers will turn on their post.
The relevant heads of the Health Social Services Centre stated that for 70 years, with the support of parties and Governments, the long-term development of disabled persons in Saar City has continued, and the increasing number of persons with disabilities have become truly involved in socio-economic development, contributors and beneficiaries and are interested in assisting persons with disabilities and are interested in supporting the activities of persons with disabilities as a whole.
The Republic is about to arrive at the seventyth anniversary, and the mass media are lit up, making many people think we don't remember much of the image, the light is shining — they are those who, for our beautiful days, bring heat and light.
However, if the hero goes next to him, it looks like you're just like me.
A study of al-Zuluan, the potential water cycle, and the birth of a beautiful winter, led to the loss of millions of people from hunger and hunger, as well as the death of an elderly farmer who likes to swim in the middle of the countryside; the Southeast, the Xiaoian, the leading scientist who is angry with China's "day" eye, a man, a cat, a cat, a cat, the only thing to do in the deep mountains of the U.S., and an old man who lives in the jungle; and a red student, a young boy who is still a little late village, to learn how to sit in the middle of the winter, to laugh and laugh at the heart; and the Red Midday artist, who is over 90 years old, is also happy to have a little time for filming in "Gunya" ...
They ask for a favor, and live a simple life, and do what they can, unless they are able to do so to the exclusion of foreigners, and they are willing to live in their own lives.
As the goldsmith said, the miner hid the tomb of his master, although he possessed the world's army, without any shame, without any sorrow.
Every "circumcision ", every sub-beast's heart, and behind it there's a family that cares about who I am.
The family is concerned not only about the hero's hair but also about the welfare of millions of people.
Once, when a woman was a student, a friend of the Internet was turned crazy, "When she was on her way, there was always someone sitting on the street screaming... I didn't want to be a hero, I wanted to be the one who was sitting on the street. "
In fact, when he calls and calls, he doesn't disagree.
Those who call on the street, they're also carrying heat and light, and they're light.
If you're like me, there's always a lot of machines in your life, there's a few moments, there's a day when you're tired, and it's like you're building a hero.
The Supreme Court of the Sea, under the responsibility of judicial reform, has given its own story at the annual meeting of the President of the Chamber of Communications, who has received a number of press letters for a year, without any mistake, " to do simple things, not to be simple " , but to send the old collection to this "crowd" by the Chief Justices.
That's the difference between heroes and a hero calling another hero.
There's a miner buried in the forest, there's a water experiment in Zulun, there's a " sky" in the South East, there's a stage, there's a show, there's a show... ... whether he's a hero, he's going to rely on his own efforts, better the environment and towards the incentive mechanism.
Like "China's Day Eyes," it looks like it's the same thing.
In the 1990s, China's sciences were still in trouble, and the " three-thirds " were not yet written.
At that time, the most cow's eye was the single oral radio remote from the Puerto Rico Mountains of the United States — Aresbo, 350 meters away, is considered the world's most "no more than" world.
At that time, China's radio remote, as if it were one of the most common.
In Japan, however, South-East countries, enjoying global scientific conditions and paywater, were forced to return to their country with a rather crazy idea: the construction of a new nuclear power " great-duty " in China and the receipt of more messages from outside space!
China's hundreds of people are missing, and the big deal is for stars?
My grandfather's trust in the South East, "The Eye of the Sun" project opens.
The address was used for 12 years, and the position fell to 9 years.
In 500 meters, the sky is opened, China is making no precedent, a unique scientific engineering in the world.
So, "the sky's eye" is awesome, the South East is awesome, it's huge, the far-reaching republic.
With the confidence of the State, the good will of the national people, the South-East has an opportunity to become the root of the people's souls.
There are young people, white heros, and people on the street, and such a country is beautiful and peaceful.
The primary education of the garbage class went into the garden of girlin and kept it from the bottom of the well.
On 27 December, a small village in the city of Gilin, Jillin, was held in an educational school for the classification of waste, which taught young children to be able to recover waste and other types of waste.
It was reported that this was the first time in the local school of early childhood education.
In the past, the nine districts of the province of Jillin had jointly launched " Programme of work for the treatment of urban waste classifications " .
In 2019, based on the test of the mandatory classification of waste for long-term urban life, the province decided to carry out work on the classification of waste for life in urban areas.
The city of Gillin is one of them.
We wish to adopt this activity to promote environmental care by bringing families together with young children, children's gardens and communities.
In the event of the holding of the event, the President of the International Children's Garden, Brigitte, said:
On that day, the gardener read the environmental project and hoped that the garbage distribution would be made from children.
After the "low-carbon" dance, children grouped into waste-class small games.
The guide also issued the " recoverable " label " for other trash " and recommended that children post their notes to the trash bin and record the video.
In her presentation, the little girl has been promoting low-carbon, green care, and regular opening of the gym.
In the field, the investment office has also set up a category of trash bins and notes above the investment category.
What are the teacher's children capable of returning garbage?
According to preliminary statistics, urban waste production in the province of Jillin was about 546.5 million tonnes in 2018, all entering the waste disposal facility.
Of these, 329.29 million tons of health care, 209.2 million tons of fuel, and 8.1 million tons of integrated use of technology.
After many years of effort, every village in the province has the ability to treat life-threatening waste.
In the programme of work for the treatment of urban waste classifications in the province of Jillin, which has been published, it is clear that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive range of waste classifications to be carried out by teaching materials and activities such as classrooms, by creating waste classifications, songs, films and videos, by strengthening the interaction between students and parents, and by achieving "Education of a child, affecting a family, moving a community and building a new generation of people."

Herac's dead. Political heritage survives.
On 26 local days, former French President Hilhak was a long man in his 86-year-old life.
The many political heritage that this French politician had left during the years of his reign was still worthy of our thanks.
Hirak has been the President of France for up to 12 years in a very private way.
He has inherited a spirit of diplomatic independence on the part of the Socialists and firmly supports the integration of Europe, which is being pursued by representatives of "European dreams".
At the same time, he has been a strong advocate of multilateralism and multilateralism in the world, a politician with a strategic perspective.
That is why the French media have assessed him as " the great representative of France on the world stage " .
Hirak is one of the political decisions of the Zinzanika Corps, which is against the war of Iraq, led by the United States.
Under his leadership, France took the United States into its hands and went ahead of the war.
After a year of war, he predicted that the war would increase terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
The facts later proved that the warning of Hirak was correct.
In Europe's integration, the United States' unilateralism is becoming more and more evident, and this year, Iraq has no doubt had a strong impact on strategic thinking and choices in international political and global affairs.
Hirak is another French politician who has given Chinese experience and affection.
He was one of the proponents and creators of the middle-law relationship " Golden Decade " and, after his first election as President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of the law relationship with the strategic eyes of politicians.
In 2004, the Central Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, with bilateral entry into the new phase.
During the Hirak regime, bilateral trade between the two countries of central law has rapidly increased, and cooperation between the two countries in many areas, such as aviation, nuclear power and railway transport, has made significant progress.
The Year of Culture of Central Law of the Hirak Initiative has created a new model of cultural exchange throughout the history of Central France.
Hilhak's life is particularly deeply affected by the prejudices of Chinese culture.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Hirak was able to turn white, some of the duchess's beads, and even the historical history of the Chinese beads.
"No matter how much gold is actually going into Egypt, no matter how much copper it really goes into China " -- this word comes from Iraq.
In response to a visit by the New York Times, Hirak said: " The political and social development of China in the West, the ecological problems arising from economic growth in China and the political status of China in the international context.
But I myself am very confident about China.
I believe that China is a country with long-standing civil history, whose experience is sufficient to help it develop its ideas and values for achieving and development and to carry on its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time. "
I also believe that the resurrection of China will bring new creativity to world culture and enrich the world culture.
Sikhs have gone, but Hirak remains to the world's political heritage and reveals that he will survive with the world.
On 27 July, the seventh Chinese Computer Agency ' s Data Study Conference on the Future of the "Millions of Light and Wisdom" was held in Ugarit, and experts and industrial leaders in the area of the Millennium Data Research, focused on the issue of large data hotspot research and the reading of large data in the technical process of human intelligence.

The Hong Kong legislation will build parliamentarians at UNU against the Inter-American Port Act
A joint statement issued by a member of the Hong Kong legislative part of Parliament on 27 May expressed strong opposition to the adoption of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019" by the United States Council of Foreign Affairs Committee.
This statement by 40 founding Members of Parliament, stated that the right currently enjoyed by Hong Kong is given by the basic law of the Hong Kong region, including the maintenance of free trade ports and individual customs zones, in various areas of economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sport, with the name "China Hong Kong" with global trade, cooperation and development relations, and the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign government or legislative body.
For a long time, Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, its participation in cooperation with different countries and regions, its participation in many relevant areas, and has been successful and transparent.
It was stated that it was not necessary for the two Chambers of the United States Council to proceed with the relevant bill to respond only to the call of its representatives in Hong Kong, as a means of cruel interference in internal affairs in Hong Kong and for its representatives to seek political co-ordination in Hong Kong.
The construction parliamentarians deeply regret this United States meeting and strongly oppose it.

According to the "European Time Report" 26th, the French Parliament will discuss migration policy reform next week.
In this regard, French President MacKron recently claimed that France could not " accept everyone " , but at the same time try to " accept well " .
It was reported that Makron tried to find a road line in immigration affairs and slowed down the forthcoming debate.
Recently, when Macedonia participated in the general debate in New York, it was expressed that it was hoped that there would be a genuine "two-way" programme on migration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: " If France wishes to receive (immigrants) properly, it will not accept everyone " .
Four priorities for the development of migration policies are set out in Macedonia: as soon as refugee protection is required; more effective promotion of migration integration; reception and protection of all migrants entering the French territory; and more effective re-establishment of illegal entry into France by persons who do not want to stay.
Whether illegal migrants should be protected by the National Medical Assistance System (AME) is the most topic under discussion in the past.
Marcon indicated that he hoped that this system could be "assessed" but not eliminated but limited to it.
Following the release of this statement by Macron, the leader of the " National Union" has been very right to claim that the appearance of the Mackon is " air talks " .
The members of the right party and party, President Lacher of the Senate, also stated that migration policy should be discussed in a "silence and "but face reality" way and that it should be criticized directly.
The left-wing social parliament member Valua believes that France should " accept more, better " , and criticize the issue of " operating" in MacKon.
It was reported that the new "Protection and Migration Law" had been promulgated for a year, leading to internal differences of opinion among political parties, but could not guarantee the right of opposition parties.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of migration policy will once again become a very right-wing focus, which will need to be addressed on this issue, but will also pose a risk for left-wing people within the political party.
It was reported that the National Assembly of France would hold a debate on immigration policy from 30 September and the Senate would hold a debate from 2 October.
There is evidence that China's A is welcome to " buy back " , and many city companies are taking " real bank" back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of the wealth of the financial servicer East, as at 27 days, the total amount of the purchase by the company on the market in A in 2019 has been over $1 billion (peoples, etc.) and over the same period of time as it has created a new history of the purchase of the amount.
In this regard, the Director-General of the Maritime Information Advisory Group stated that this year the overall market value of Unit A was lower, with relatively low price repurchasing shares that contributed to the efficiency of the use of funds by companies in the upper market and demonstrated the willingness and cash flow of companies in the market's initiative to manage the market value, and the confidence of investors was enhanced.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the repurchasing system has also contributed to the active repurchasing of the shares on the market.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the rules for the implementation of the market-owned repurchasing unit issued by the Overseas Bank and the deep-sea banking firm provided for the market-owned companies with a detailed set of repurchasing rules and guidelines.
In addition, media statistics have been implemented since this year to promote the repurchasing plan mainly in the infrastructure industry, the ground industry, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment manufacturing industry.
In addition, 6 companies in the city have recovered over $100 billion this year from the reimbursement of the purchase.
Among them, the first was the Ili portion, which returned the amount of $50 million.
What impact will the market have on the market by the company's repurchasing?
The Deputy Director General of the Financial Institute of the People ' s University of China, Mr. Zheung, in his interview with the new journalists in China, said that the repurchasing was one way to demonstrate the economic strength and better financial situation of the city companies, the ability to maintain the unit's price stability and trust to investors; and the fact that the company and its control unit were responsible for companies and the market and the consideration of investors.
The former had been established in good business performance of the company, and the latter had demanded higher quality of the company and its control unit.
For the capital market, these are all the core elements.
The higher market company's repurchasing shares are useful for boosting investors' confidence and contributing to the higher market's price.
In addition, according to the East Bank survey, according to the total number of expected shares settled by the company on the market since the beginning of this year, as well as the total value of the recovered shares, this year the increase in the amount of additional funds brought on the A unit market was expected to exceed $15 billion.
In the next two months, the National Focus-Purchase Unit will be reopened on 26 days of the "Sacrament of the Day" revision of the large wall after the Sun.
The "Sacrifice of the Heavens" is a comprehensive reflection of the great traditional walls of Mother's birth.
With the approval of the State-related sector, the headquarters of the Museum of Civilization of the City of Petroleum (after-the-Section) was formed from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this wall painting is painted in the south of the sky, on the north wall, 32 meters long, 2.6 m high, at the bottom of both sides of the sky and 30 stories about the rise of the sun, and 358 people have re-presented the birth mark of their ancestors.
In recent years, according to the U.S. Secretary-General's report, more rain and winter rains have resulted in the collapse of the wall, which accounts for 60 per cent of the entire wall's surface.
In order to protect and save the mother-to-morrow wall, the Old Cultural Street Commission and the Post-Day Buildings of South-Westphalia launched a reconstruction project for the House of Heaven and the House of Commons.
The rehabilitated project was hosted by the Grand Duchess and invited four national artists to participate together.
Rehabilitation was based on the principle of 'adjustment as old', while the original wall had been adjusted to the content of the Department and additional repairs were made to the site where it was originally imperfect.
In rehabilitating, we have also done innovations and experiments in color, materials, paint.
After the restoration, there were the wind, the spirit, the spirit, and the artistic patterns of the original wall.
In 1326 it was built in 1326. It was one of China's oldest mothers in the present century.
On 25 September, Beijing was hosted by a large international airport.
Beijing's international airport's construction site is called the "Seven Miracles of the New World."
At the present time, Beijing's international airport has been overloaded by overloaded by 1 billion + passengers last year, and the second year the world's second-year passenger is overcrowded.
It is expected that by 2022, Beijing will reach 45 million passengers and that international flights will account for 20 per cent; by 2025 it will reach 72 million passengers and international flights will reach 30 per cent more than expected.
As "the new door," how cool is it?
Beijing's largest international airport between Beijing's metropolis and the city-wide district of the North River Province, which is 46 km away from the daily security line, is now the largest new site of global construction.
The surface of the roof of its buildings is 18,000 square feet [18,000 sq m], with 25 standard football sizes.
Beijing International Airport is the world's first airport with two arrivals and two departures — F1-F4, respectively, international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-dimensional bridges outside the airport are connected to high-speed and airports, F3, F4 — international departures and both domestic departures are possible.
Beijing's leading international airport opened the Beijing "Two Airports" era.
The new airport is located as a large international airport, a new source of energy for national development, an integrated transport chain in the Künzin Region, which is now built in Beijing, with a total of 66 airlines aiming to enter Beijing International Airports, of which 20 are domestic airlines, 46 Porta area and foreign airlines, and the number of airlines is on the increase.
In the winter of 2019, Beijing International Airport is expected to launch 116 lines, including 101 lines, 15 international routes; covering 112 global flights, including 97 national airports, and 15 international airports.
This resulted in coordinated development with Beijing International Airports, an appropriate competition, an international two-year-old "competitive" platform with international competitiveness, which alleviated both the size of the capital airport and its operational pressure, and could better meet the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and around the surrounding areas and effectively boosted international competitiveness in our civil aviation.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing's international airport has taken full account of its geographical location, its relationship with the surrounding area and its operating environment, its routes for the first time using "all types" in the country, the use of the world's largest air automation system, and the establishment of China's maximum terminal control zones, which can maximize aviation efficiency.
For the first time, national-scale airports have used national-produced railways and information management systems to develop innovative rail transport models and to improve the efficiency of rail systems.
Beijing is the head of international airport, predicting the launch of a cocoon.
It has created 40 remaining international and first nationally, reaching more than 98 per cent of new airports, which will have direct and indirect economic effects on the industry in the surrounding areas and will contribute to the entry into space for the economic development of Beijing.
The meeting was scheduled to be convened by Malawi on November 16th, on the proposal to transfer the party to the age of 16.
In early November, Malawi provisionally convened the Central Representative of the General Assembly, which proposed a revision of the Party ' s chapter into the Party ' s age to 16.
As a result of the adoption of the Assembly of the General Assembly of the 66th Central Representative to be held this year, Malawi announced its proposal to amend the chapter of the Party, including the movement of the Party from under 18 to 16 years of age.
Director-General Nassuzrei said that the Commission was originally scheduled to convene the Central Representative of the General Assembly on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the date of the Conference may have changed as a result of the election of the Danish National Meeting.
He said that since the election committee would meet only on 1 October on the date of nomination and vote in Denmark, they would discuss whether the date of the Central Representative of the General Assembly would be changed on Friday, 2 October.
He also explained that yesterday (26 days) the purpose of the Committee's convening was to set the date of the General Assembly and modify the chapter of the Party, and that it was only a matter of concern to the Danish Congress of the People's Party on Indigenous Unity that the laws of the Republic of Moab were not infertile and therefore joined in the agenda for the election of the country.
The King of the East East East Light Commission — The New Yorker of the Heavily Ingenuity
Kung-Bungao, East-Easter, born in February 1943, participated in the work in 1967, and later served as the Citizens, Citizens, and Mayors.
In 1986, King Ben-Bird signed the Treaty of Light in the province of São Paulo, which was then a poor country.
During the five years of the work of light, the King's heart was moved by three things: the promotion of food industry; the development of North-Westphalia; and the development of industrial transformations; and the encouragement of the lighthouses from which lighthouses were encouraged; and the setting up of boards.
There are traditional food and lessons for the hungry farmers.
At the beginning of the 80th century, there was no sale of food for farmers, and it was buried in the ground.
The King's Landing Research found that it's key to getting food.
Light rates were first built for the distribution of food into the market and opened up a precedent for the development of the market economy.
The party members are taking the lead, screwing up, all lost.
In 1989, with the support of the Kingdom of Great Britain, 17 party members, including the three-day triangular kingdom of Juju, gathered 17 winter meals, which were released in the village in the year of the release of 17 " two million books " .
Later in the circle, a dispersion group was established and, under the influence of the Queen, the kingdom was headed around the villages; in the first year, more than 5,000 grain farms were grown and the grain was then spread to the whole country as a result of the drought.
For thousands of years, 160,000 landland in the north has been covered with sand, which is the seabed.
The local people live very hard.
There's a lot of food in the south, right?
Ten million people were killed in the Battle of Queens. They lived in the wilderness for forty-five days.
The government's leading department in the province is eating on the ground, driving a car like a civilian worker, opening up the air, and seeing the old people grow their fingers and their eyes wide... ...and then, in the north, they develop 150,000 wells, 200,000 wells, and 600,000 wells, and they develop " beautiful beads " on the hill.
In July 1986, the first time that King Burmese participated in the Industrial Conference in Zhao City.
During the meeting, an " industrial economic figures for the 12 district districts of the city of Chihuahua " were issued for comparison, with the total industrial value of Chihuahua, also good lighting, and grade IV.
But if the original is removed, the pure industrial product of light is only $119 million and the third is reduced.
The King's army of more than 70 people ran into the field.
In less than a year, the total investment of $150 million was based on 77 projects.
Every year thereafter, it was organized to " take the team " into deep, east and upper seas.
Immigrants, more entrepreneurs.
The President of the Queen of Queens convened the thematic plans of the conference: 40 "entrepreneurs" were launched on an industrial line.
In 1991, the lights entered the country's national hundreds of railways, and the Governor was appointed Vice-President of the City of Zhao.
He's left with more than 200,000 food stores, with 1.2 million rice fields, with 4854 companies, with more than 100,000 "cookers " , with hundreds of recognized forces. The people of Xiao are still closely called him "our bibliography " .
On 26 September local time, members of the State and the Queen of Foreign Affairs took the lead at United Nations Headquarters in New York, in China and in the African Council Member States.
Tono, Foreign Minister of Côte d ' Ivoire, Ojono, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Pandor of South Africa, and Cala of Niger, Foreign Member of the Council, and Jaginavi, Minister of Tunisia.
The Queen made four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the two Central African parties in the Council.
First, it's a united force.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, which directly results from the challenge of the basic norms of international relations, the role of the United Nations in shock, and the interests of large and small developing countries, including African countries.
In response to this challenge, there is a need for Central African handshake, arms and arms, and solidarity.
In the Council, three African countries spoke with one voice, and the combined segment was not only three votes but the entire continent of Africa.
China and Africa are represented not only by four votes but also by other countries, which will influence and shape the Council ' s agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with members of the Council to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, consult the dispute.
China has been promoting a political solution to the hot spots, a good tradition of consultation in Africa and a successful round of experience between regional and subregional organizations in Africa.
Many complex issues on the Council ' s agenda, particularly Africa ' s hot spot, are largely colonialized and are directly related to external factors.
We need to make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play a good role in the rotation and mediation of the United Nations.
Third, rely on your own strength.
African countries and peoples are best aware of the problems of Africa, and Africa is also able to address their own problems wisely.
When addressing the issue of Africa ' s hotspots, the Council should focus on the will of Africa and should play a role in regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support the internal solutions from Africa.
China would like to strengthen its coordination with non-members and to strongly promote capacity-building for self-peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, based on development governance.
China and large African countries are developing countries, and we want to continue to put economic and social development first and support each other ' s different ways of development.
China would like to build a " one-way " with the African Union " 2063 Agenda " , the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda, the 2030 United Nations Development Strategy for Africa, and to help African countries strengthen their development capacity to eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We would like to promote joint United Nations involvement in Africa ' s development.
The situation in the Congo (Kin) has again worsened, China has and will continue to support its efforts to provide capacity and human resources and material assistance, and will be willing to act in coordination with African countries to mobilize increased assistance efforts such as the United Nations, WHO and to play a role in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo (Gin).
The New Birth Section will be able to save little lives.
It's amazing!
A 32-week-old pregnant woman was forced to be born on her father's side of the car while working on the road to the hospital.
Fortunately, both the maternity section and the new pediatrician have been treated in a timely manner and have been able to regain this small life.
In fact, on 19 and 21 days, three premature babies were born on the road, and two others were born on 120 emergency vehicles and 29 weeks of early birth.
Ms. Gen was a second pregnant mother, and on 19 September, at 7:00 a.m., she felt a bit tired, thinking that she had been pregnant for 32 weeks, and the first one was early, and she picked up supplies and prepared to wash herself directly to the hospital.
After 9 a.m., Ms. Ghenn took appropriate care of her husband to get him to the hospital from his house in the east.
Not knowing how soon the car had just been opened, the baby was forced to be born on his father's side of the car.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Gandhi and her precious daughter finally arrived at the Mother's Hospital for Baby Health in North Lake.
The hospital security was able to see the couple and the little baby, who immediately informed Mother's house that four doctors and assistants were waiting to see her pack and bags.
"At that time, half of the mother lay on the back of her car, under her body were sheep and blood, and a boy was next to her and tied with her. "
It is interesting to know that baby was a 32-week-old baby. On the way, parents did not come and covered their children with blankets. The early morning mornings had a sense of humor. He had white hair, no tears, and no nausea.
She hurried to the back of her home to treat the baby's stomach, and quickly opened the mother’s pack, which she used for her baby’s treatment bags and the baby’s package of treatment bags, and cleaned the bathroom (such as the picture), which she then held on to 12 new baby beds.
After the news of the birth of a new nurse, the hospital was immediately able to rescue this precious former lady from the ground.
At that time, he was diagnosed with rare reddening and lack of oxygen. The doctor immediately gave him a ventilator regimen, not for a minute, and a beautiful resurgence, and also a gradual reddening and success.
After entering the hall, this 32-week baby has had a breathing machine, a continuous rescue, a breathing system, and a successful withdrawal machine on the second day.
After a week of treatment, precious life-sustainment, breathing, and breast-feeding have begun.
It is true that on 19 and 20 days, 21 days, three early births on the road were contacted by the Pregnant and New Child Section for three days, both of which were born in 120 emergency vehicles and 29 weeks of early births and are currently active in the New Child Life Section.
In recent years, a number of women in the province have been born on land, and the preciousness of their private car, which is not a good deal to deal with, is likely to threaten the mother ' s safety.
The Director reminded me that when my mother became pregnant, when she suffered pain, water, and red blood cells, she should be treated immediately.
If the child is pregnant in the home or on the road, the mother should be at the same level as the mother is allowed to breastfeed, prevent the baby from breastfeeding after the first pregnancy, protect the child immediately after breastfeeding, and send the doctor as soon as possible.
More official operations of the New Air Technology Company
The establishment of VSTEA is one of the details of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 by VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, which marks the question of the first Vietnamese aircraft maintenance and maintenance company.
Two air navigation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperate to provide air navigation equipment and maintenance services to domestic airlines.
Over the years, the Director-General of the Aviation Company has expressed his agreement with the company — ST Engineering Aerospace — the world's largest and the highest level of aircraft conservation group.
The more we navigate, the more we believe that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides, as well as the opening of a wide-ranging future partnership.
The Head of ST Engineering Aerospace, Lim Serh Ghee, said that the sharing of experience with ST Engineering would help bind companies to provide international conservation and maintenance services to ensure the safety of flights from airlines.
VSTEA's survival has helped to increase its navigation towards a wide-ranging potential for access to large-scale aircraft equipment for conservation and maintenance markets.
At the same time, there is a great opportunity for modern technology and training in aviation technology personnel.
It is therefore better to meet the sustainable development needs of the Vietnamese aviation industry.

The city series "Wonderful New China ", which was released by the Government of Washington, D.C., on 27 days ago, was announced in the "Worming China " series, which has accelerated industrial intelligence reform since this year and has been implementing the best transitional aid measures for 2000 million dollars.
At present, more than 800 industrial enterprises have been collecting information on demand-renewing capacity-building.

Trudo's "people are breaking up" and can he succeed?
This time, when Trudo was pulled out of one of his heads, it was Trudo himself.
Recently, Canada's media linked several old pictures of current Prime Minister Trudo, who painted Trudo himself as black.
This was seen as a clear racial discrimination, which soon led to a massive wave in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo apologized again to the public.
However, the Canadian population did not buy it.
Trudo's count is to move the stone to his feet.
As political commentators say, since the rise of the " Black Face Movement" from the United States, Trudo and the Federal Liberation Party have consistently been accusing the opposition party or the parties of the party of disagreement in this regard of " a great deal " , and several times " statements " must be dismissed immediately by any person who makes such a mistake " .
It's simple, this time, when Trudo was pulled out of a head of a "bitch," it was a little bit of a hole in Trudo's head.
Trudo was the son of Pierre Trudo, former Prime Minister of Canada, a young British man who had just launched a "political image" on his way.
He was originally "political" who, following the election of the Federal Free Party, fought a beautiful victory in the 2015 federal legislative elections of Canada — half of the fedian Free Party's presidency in the federation's sub-station and received the precious privilege of a single group.
At the time, Trudo introduced many exciting political formulas, such as " " Eco-security " " " economic revitalization " , stressing corruption and " wrong wind " .
However, for five years in power, he had almost all of the above-mentioned haircuts, " high-fashioned walking " .
With regard to "ethnicity and gender equality" he did not speak of this "black face" incident, which he had previously done in a series of articles on indigenous peoples, which had led indigenous groups to move the protesters to the gates of the National Assembly during the 150th anniversary of the construction of Canada.
In the area of corruption, at the end of last year, Trudo was involved in the famous "Millions of Spirits" events.
It has been removed, and the construction company of its own village has been seriously infringing private dance cases with pressure on the authorities and officials responsible for the investigation, demanding that the latter be " high-handed " .
In addition, Trudo, who is angry with officials who have become angry at the disclosure of the case — the Kingdom of Canada mentioned in the preceding article — is the first time he has been able to disclose the case and is directly responsible for the conduct of the case.
Despite the fact that the case itself is still questionable, it is difficult to explain.
Many observers have noted that Trudo's five-year-old government has collapsed, mainly due to its own "crowds" and that the largest "crowd" goes beyond "cooked fruit" and "cooked by the law, which is more serious than "cooked" by the law.
The most powerful Anguis-Radder media data from Canada show that from 2015 to today, the number of visits to Trudo has increased from 60 per cent to 30 per cent from 60 per cent, and the opposition has risen from less than 30 per cent to 60 per cent.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have shown similar ill-will, even a considerable part of the voters who still wish to vote in the Federal Free Party are still unwilling to present themselves to this Federal Prime Minister, who is the head of the political party.
On 21 October, a new Canadian federal legislative election was about to begin, and would Trudo be able to replay a five-year-old winning drama?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of business competition, the level of experience of consumers, or the integration of regional aviation, and the level of integration of Kinshasa development, have a profound and positive impact.
On 25 September, Beijing was officially transported by international airports.
Newspapers from Beijing were informed that the capital airport had been in a state of emergency and operation and that international airports were in good shape and would improve its airport service capacity.
Following the sea, Beijing became the second city with two airports in my country, which served mainly in domestic aviation services with respect to the above-mentioned international airports, while the airport was similar to international aviation, and the future capital airports and major airports would also provide more detailed services in terms of differentiation between domestic and international aviation operations.
Global airport traffic, from an operational development perspective, has a more positive impact on capital airports.
The number of passengers in the capital airport fell by 10 million in 2018 and the country's capital, but there was still a clear lack of transport, especially international aviation requirements.
In order to better serve domestic tourists, to meet their needs, to adapt to the growing needs of Beijing, to open-up urban development trends with international connections, and to set up large international airports as international airports, which plan to meet an estimated 10 million passengers per year, and to generate 4 million tons of mail.
As a result, the two airports are not revolving, and there are also sufficient market space for different customers.
From the economic point of view, international air traffic at large international airports will clearly form a dual impact, alleviate the tension in Beijing, speed up the growth of passengers and freight bulkheads, and generate increased fuel for both operations in the capital.
From a user's point of view, the future would not have to focus on the launch of a major international airport and could also reduce a range of problems caused by over-focused airports, such as over-the-stop security times, increased travel speeds, indirect increases in aircraft and passengers' stays at airports, increased the burden of operating at airports and reduced traffic through capital airports, and in fact improved the customer's performance experience.
According to the media's calculation of the number of travel times and costs for large international airports, such as the launch of a high-speed direct high-speed high-speed train from the South to the South, 50 minutes of driving can be achieved, the cost of oil comes to around 40 dollars and the cost of 15 dollars; the choice of a high-speed rail train train is limited to 20 km, 30 km, and the price is 10 dollars, 25 dollars and 35 dollars; citizens can also travel to the city of Kyongyon and from Beijing to the major airport for more than 20 minutes.
In general, there are a number of transport tools available to citizens at large airports, and costs and time are also within a more reasonable range.
From a trendal development point of view: The location of the airport is Künzinj-Turkey, so far away from Beijing City, but it has strengthened the north of Beijing, but it has made it easier for more people to go out and significant economic development in the northern part of the Rava River and in the northern part of Beijing.
In the future, in the north of the river, passengers will be able to enjoy more international aviation services provided by international airports, which can be seen from traffic planning at major airports.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing, there are a number of high-speed road-connected airports and surrounding areas.
This is just as true of the east coast of Beijing, as well as of the city-to-the-petroleum, which is located on the coast of Beijing, and the inhabitants of JoAnno district will benefit from the airport and get efficient air services.
It can therefore be seen that high-level international airports have not only increased routes and several aircraft, either from the level of business competition, the level of consumer experience, or the integration of regional aviation, and the level of integration of Kinzin development, have a profound and positive impact and significance, not only on the long-term long-range and development of the Cuban shipping industry, but also on the development of diverse options for the output of the general population of Kinzin, to further enhance the quality of the Beijing shipping services, and to facilitate the integration of Kinzin development processes, and to facilitate the development of trade in the surrounding areas of the airport.
Therefore, with regard to air traffic at large airports, we need more than a small individual account in the economy, rather than a whole development account.
27-day mediumboard index 1.46 per cent - New York Network

Meeting of the Forum on the Economic and Social Affairs of Viet Nam, 2019 in the province of Al-Qaida
At the beginning of this year, the Vice-President of the Economic Commission for the Conference of the States of Viet Nam revealed that there were many new developments in the socio-economic development of Viet Nam and that the situation continued to grow.
This forum focused on economic social issues highlighted several months before 2019 and proposed measures for economic social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
In the Forum, representatives of the Board shared their views and views on the impact of the 2019 Economic Development and Part-of-Commerce Agreements, some of the highlights of the 2019 Vietnamese economy, the 2019 Vietnamese social culture, and four topics such as the 2020 forecast and recommendations for the development of Vietnamese social development.
The representatives generally felt that global economic growth was slowing down, increased risks and challenges in the first few months of 2019.
Trade molluscs among large economies have further exacerbated global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, although the global economy is inexhaustible and 70 per cent of its global economies are in the state of growth, there are still many positive developments in Vietnamese economic development, macroeconomic stability, inflation being effectively controlled, and the average population consumption index growth of the first half of 2019 is 2.64 per cent and the minimum growth of the three-year period.
GDP growth of 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019 , although below 7.05 per cent of the same period last year , is still higher than the level of the same period from 2011 to 2017.
In predicting the trend towards the development of Vietnamese economy in 2019-2020, Vice-Chair of the National Economic Preview Centre for Viet Nam stated that there was a higher growth trend in the world economy in 2019 in the context of the global economy.
It is expected that by 2020, the Vietnamese macroeconomic economy will continue to remain fundamentally stable, and the implementation of trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic structural adjustment, increased business environment improvement and the impact of trade fraud on foreign export activities in Viet Nam.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring of early warning mechanisms, to seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese export goods, to look for opportunities to develop new export markets and to facilitate exports of various goods, such as agricultural products.
At the same time, inflation rates will be controlled at a reasonable level, thereby contributing to industrial development and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and organic agriculture.
The head of the Office of the Constable of Ambassadors of China in Cambodia, Jean-Jee-Chief, held an invitation on 26 May in Chihuahua to celebrate the establishment of the new China for the 70th anniversary.
He said that in the 1970s, China had been active in international affairs, contributing to the improvement of global economic governance, contributing to global common development, contributing to China ' s smarter programmes and to world peace and development, as well as its real interest in the economic development and well-being of Cambodia.

He said that this year was the year the Central Bank was founded in 61 years, the two countries had brotherly affection and cooperation in the Middle East would be a force for local economic social development.
Disaha, governor of the province of Huang Province, highly praised the great achievements of new China in 70 years and commended the results of friendly cooperation between the two Central African States.
Disakha expects both parties to continue to make progress in promoting friendship and cooperation in the Middle East, to strengthen mutual trust and to continue to improve the standard of living of peoples.
Disaha said that he was familiar with the friends of the Chinese municipalities, and that he had so far concluded a friendship relationship with 28 Chinese municipalities, a large cultural project "Shiko smile" and "Khikoko" fall, a new international airport project, a special training course for government officials in Zhao Qiqi, a village school scholarship, a village clinic, a refurbishment of public interest projects "lighting", and a direct benefit to the people in Kenya in their friendly cooperation.

According to the company's manager, this film-leading "quality prosecutor" has focused on more than 40,000 models of lead and behind-the-fly computing power, which can quickly transform the raw image into two-pronged language and place a flat-screen disc classification.
This company is just a reflection of today's manufacturing transformer.
The Ministry of Industry and Information has issued a " Guide to Entrepreneurship Implementation (2018-2020 ) in 2018 " , which was submitted by 2020 to strive to achieve a clear and positive increase in awareness and application of enterprise.
The founder of Al-Qaida strongly stated that today data centres have built bridges for the digital economy of data as key elements and have opened the way.
At the same time, for 10 years, my country's industry has been expanding.
The White Paper for Development (2019) published by the China Information Institute in July this year shows that China's GDP was estimated at $962.8 million in 2018 and increased by 39.2 per cent in 2017.
In addition to becoming a transformive industry, key technologies for digital economic development have also changed urban management and social life in ignorance.
This year's "Citizen brain" continues to attract attention.
In the case of Aliju, the city capital has now become part of the urban management tool and the related cooperation application has been extended to 23 global cities.
Through the head of the picture, the city's brain is aware of the fact that the new urban management services, such as " Tourism Road Design " , can be achieved by means of a strong computing capacity to " pay " before the stop of the car " .
In the field of government services, "a bridge" has been used to address a " thing" and to promote "hand-on-hand office " and "hand-hand-on-hand" in conjunction with the "hand-hand-hand" office, which has made it easier for both parties to calculate the provision of government services.
At the present time, Zhao has been established through government and a unified public data platform throughout the province.
As at 11 September, this platform has covered more than 5 5 million permanent population and more than 15 million legal units in the province, collecting data from the management of the 3066 category 190.8 million.
The average monthly traffic between the government sector in the province of Zheung has reached 120,000 times, and the flow of data over the 'Shu ' may mean that the number of people running is low.
Be careful with a cup of tea!
According to the "Central Society" report, a recent Canadian study found that one package of cookies could release billions of and even more than one million microwaves, significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake, but there is no evidence to date that it would pose a threat to mankind.
Researchers at the University of Magyar, Canada, reportedly found that the bottle of tea was packed into almost hot water (95 degrees Fahrenheit), which would release about 11 billion bottles of tea and 3 billion smaller vitamins into the cup.
This figure is significantly higher than that estimated by one person throughout the year.
According to research content previously published in 2019, at least 50,000 microchips are consumed each year, while inhaling the same amount of microchills.
The study was published in the "Environment Science and Technology Journal", where researchers tested four different types of Montenegrin Stores and the coffee office to open the tea packs and then to collect the tea bags into almost boiling water for five minutes after washing them, using electronic light bulbs and light bulbs.
According to this study, they found that a single cup of tea released more than 11 billion microchips, " several levels higher than those of other foods before. "
It is reported that most tea bags are made of natural rubber, but many of them are still used for natural tea packaging cards.
Some of the cardboard boxes are not used for paper, but they are used for paper, which is the subject of a test of researchers.
The microchip is a small fraction of the shellfish, and researchers define these sizes between 100 and 5 kilometres, mainly from the bulk of the shellfish.
Researchers have found these microorganisms in global air, soil, rivers and deep seabeds, from water, bottled water, sea and beer.
In October 2018, researchers found microchips in samples from various countries around the world.
In order to test the potential toxicities of teasing, the Canadian study team found that the water was placed in contaminated waters and that it would affect the behaviour of these plants and cause them to develop the soil.
According to WHO, there has been no evidence to date that the seizure of pesticides poses a threat to mankind.
However, WHO noted that further research was needed to fully understand the extent to which these substances were spread to the environment and the impact on mankind.
Researchers estimate that these packs may be due to large amounts of mercury and may involve contact with drinking water, even when the “food level” fat is heated up to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C], or toxic substances may also be separated or extracted.
Gutres stated that the climate emergency was the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster will affect the development of one generation.
Barbados, which has been attacked by hurricanes since this year, Dominica and the Bahamas have described the situation.
About one quarter of the island developing countries live in 5 metres or less of the sea.
Migration may seriously affect their social and life-styles, even leading to sovereignty and national identity.
At this week ' s climate action summit, small island States jointly committed themselves to achieving 100 per cent of carbon renewable energy by 2030, thereby re-directing the world towards the right direction.
Gutres said: " The climate crisis is putting new injustices on the back of the old.
Despite the small island developing countries ' contribution to global warming, they paid the highest price.
Because these countries are in middle-income conditions, many countries are also in the accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must take action, now is the time to make important decisions and to invest large numbers of small island developing countries. "
A political declaration was adopted at today's high-level meeting calling for assistance in disaster management by small island developing States, investment in climate-adjusted infrastructure and methods of transition to renewable energy; international institutions urged small island developing States, particularly middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing States are at the front line of the oceans for the protection and preservation of life on Earth.
The latest special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the oceans have had serious consequences for the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may have had an annual rise in extreme sea levels by the beginning of the first century.
The report warns that if there is no large amount of funding for adaptation, some island countries are likely to be unable to live.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused significant losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living cells, and in the past 40 years, the carbon pollution has increased tenfold.
The needs of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to resource reductions, including the maintenance of many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs of transport and energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on a number of external markets, which make them subject to price fluctuations on the right.
Some countries are also working to address the security effects of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Gutres said: " By addressing a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be considered worldwide. "
He stressed that small island developing States were examples of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment throughout the international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India has shown sufficient flexibility in the financial system.
On 26 September, the Minister for Finance of India stated that the current mobility of the financial system was sufficient and that India's economic growth was expected to recover during the next half-year of the financial year under the chain of consumption requirements.
Sitaraman made the above-mentioned statements after the meeting with the Indian private bank, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Sitaraman did not describe the targetness of those words.
The past part of India's media and overseas media have been constantly slowing down the current economy of India into the dynamic tensions of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitaraman, for example, was sold by a car and denied mobility pressure as the reason for the sale.
Sitaraman noted that traffic sales were mainly affected by seasonal factors.
Sitaraman expects that under the chain of consumption of the Sundays, the economic growth of India may be restored in the next half-year.
The purchase period in India once a year will continue from September to the end of the year.
The market expects that the consumption of goods will significantly contribute to economic growth in India.

I'm talking about the country, the people's souls, the white whales, the old seafarers, for college students.
"I and my grandpa are talking about the school to make students "unhappy."
During the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China, four well-known seafarers, white bears, came to the " art class " at the University of Ouija boards of the First World Trade Union on 27 May, and four representatives of over 90 years of seafarers, Zhiji, described as more than 200 young students, the national soul.
List of products from the current locale.
The excitement in the classroom made the students uncomfortable, and outside the classroom, they carefully put on the product list of old-age cards, as well as "I and my country" playing the "school" to make the students "unsatisfied " .
The big white bean, the big white bean, as an old symbol card, the big white bee, has been actively trying to change in recent years, to take the lead in fighting, to keep up with innovation and cross-border.
She was born in 1959 this year, and she was born 60 years old.
Thousands of lives will also focus their attention on young consumers.
In a letter from the Ministry of the Limitation of the Marine Foods, Deputy Director-General Zhejie referred to "the desire to eat fish, the hunger of the winter, the hunger of the winter, the hunger of the winter, and the hunger of the winter" as an example of increasing innovation in "food".
In addition, companies are increasingly collecting card culture in terms of food innovation and packaging design, to adapt to the transmission of young consumer groups.
The old-fashioned representative of the "Artificial Party" on the scene tells of the way to innovation.
"All innovations are not the basis for realization, and every innovation is a complex process.
Everyone's heart is hidden from the hope of the old one.
As a center of the product, small and beautiful times should begin."
As one of the first national "China's Old No. " , it was also possible to adapt rapidly to market fluctuations, to the VI-visual upgrade of the cards, to the introduction of professional operating teams, and to the achievement of a significant increase in business volumes.
"In addition to these traditional channels, such as the supermarkets, the old codes can now be seen as active participation in new retail and activities.
All of our changes, finally to achieve such a purpose, are to enable consumers to see, hear, and finally get. "
The Deputy Director-General of the Overseas (Group) Limited Company said.
In the future, the seabed will also sustain high-level development, develop a broad vision of the system, develop user-friendly environmental products, maintain high scientific and technological content and make the path to high economic benefits.
Through this art party class, students received a scholarship.
With my older brother, I've had good memories and feelings in my childhood. "
It's the same thing as school.
More than 200 young students were represented by representatives of the seafarers, who described their country's status as an old-fashioned card.
Thesis also said that how to cultivate the culture of cardboards, to transfer the traditional cultural heritage of quality, to be born without birth, is a matter that we as designers of professionals need to think and explore.
The course is based on the project "Operation of the Sea" by the President of the Academy of Arts of the University of Washington, U.S.A., which is based on the Professor's "Earth Collection of Marks" workroom, which seeks to deepen the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the archipelago by using the Competitiveness and Effects of the Sea Marks, to increase the cultural radiation collection of the Sea Marks in order to achieve the industrial effects of "1+1>2" in the form of "design+cultural" from a new perspective.

" Some over-age farmers in some areas are estimated to be over half of them.
Where are you looking for young workers now?
There's no way to use so many 'olds' on the farm. "
In recent days, there have been a number of cases of over-age agricultural workers (over-retirement) who have been working on construction contractors for many years.
In recent years, high school seniors have carried out rain-distortion projects, where there have been a number of agricultural workers in the school, and if they have been observed, there are a number of older farmers here.
The work outside the age of farmers is not " unsatisfied " , but because "it's impossible " , it's hard and hard - whether it's money to solve their old age and health problems or help foster children who are forced to continue to work hard.
The "old-fashioned" farm worker didn't think we were so light.
Raising children, raising older ones, raising children, reading books, helping children to rent their homes, helping children to become businesses, sometimes raising children, when these farmers have completed " life-long tasks " , the money bags have been emptied even a number of debts, and there is a lack of wealth.
In order not to discourage children from amassing some wealth for themselves, a number of farmers insist on " working hard until they do so " .
Many of the 80 "90" to "00 " generation-old farmers are unwilling to work under conditions, work-intensive secondary or low-service industries resulting in structural " waste " , which are not attractive and provide opportunities for older farmers.
In view of the lack of long-term skills, physical and labour capacities are also declining, and workers of a few years of age are working hard, low-income, high-risk and low-risk jobs.
A day is one day, and a little bit more than a day, and the living conditions of over-year-old farmers are not ignored and destroyed.
The problem of unemployment and unemployment, health protection, reduced security risks, increased labour income, improved the living conditions of over-age farmers, in addition to their " self-sustainment " , has also been avoided by the public sector ' s system of protection and human rights.
It was noted that over-age farmers could no longer rely on the possibility of returning home to solve their old age and health problems, and they had to step away from home by other means.
Reading the wisdom and strength of the "not to be shaken" workers helps us to better understand the love and pain of the workers of the past.
Seeing the background of over-age farmers, listening to their relief efforts to bring them back to their villages, they really achieve " old-fashioned " , they need the public sector, the market and society share responsibility in good interaction, and they need multiple strength.
Chemezov said that in the next five years, Russia would not export such systems because " the supply of its own army first and then export production " .
This practice is entirely in line with international practice.
The main producer countries of arms and military equipment always ensure their national defence requirements first and then deal with export orders.
In the early days, the Deputy Director General of the Russian Air Force, General Yuri Grehoff, indicated that the system's development work would soon be completed.
S-500 systems are developed by the "Cinconstone-Anti-Air Protection of the Sun.
This is a new generation of air defence systems that have applied the principles of work for the destruction of ballistics and air dynamics objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to capture the average ballistic missile, which can be fired within 3500 km.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 could also destroy high-speed passenger missiles and aircraft, almost all types of non-aircraft, more than 5-speed high-speed missiles, even in close space.
Such weapons can also be combined with other air defence systems as a single network, particularly S-400 systems, which is very important from a national perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great need in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the northern region.
S-400 air defence systems are engaged in UNMEE.
According to a report dated 15 September, the work of the New Isle ' s NRA has been completed in the replacement of the S-400 Air Missile Missile System.
This is not the militaryization of Russia in the Northern Hemisphere.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia claims that this is entirely the process in the transitional plan towards the north-east strategic direction.
The North-Easter Force News Service reported: " With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the control areas of the North-East region have increased significantly. "
It is very important that, according to the military assessment, the system is successful in its use in the northern and northern regions.
UNAMI officers have trained the new system and are preparing to enter the combat value field.
Formerly equipped there is a S-300 remote air defence system, which is still a part of it.
As for the air defence system, it must have weapons that can destroy all kinds of airborne targets, whether they are targets of high-speed flights at the external level or close to " fishing nets of protected facilities " .
According to public information sources, the S-400 " Triumph " system designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed targets and other air weapons, is designed to protect against radiation.
This weapon could attack air-industrial targets within 400 km range and fall within 60 km of distance with ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km per second.
Russia will never hide its deployment forces in the northern region in order to ensure the territorial safety of the North Sea.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor-M2DT air missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic Area, which were sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen the North-West Region air defence system.
At that time, the Russian Ministry of Defence indicated that the future of the North Toler Force would be extended to a complete tourist construction.

According to the Russian Government, the flagship will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods in the market and avoid the complex and long process of operating their own shops.
Russian multi-enterprises, which are market operators, are focused on selling Russian goods in China.
The largest Chinese trading platform (Tmall), Kyoto (JD), 1688 , Pinduodoo , ShouQ , and Wichat (Wechat) are available at online stores, and have their own online platforms Ejuno.com and Russian market chains.
The Russian export centre will jointly develop a trade fair disposal strategy and participation standards with Russia and select the product companies to be marketed.
The store plans to operate and raise products of at least 10 Russian manufacturers this year.
The information provided by the Russian export centre shows that China's electronics platform visited up to 100 million times a month.

At present, the Group will also launch pilot shops in the framework of the Global Import Strategy for sale from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Aleksher Kozhovnikov, sales will be available in the new store for at least 50 million rubs.
In fact, my expectations are higher than 50 million rubs.
We all know that Chinese consumers are very positive about Russian goods and that they consider our goods to be high quality and green green products. "
Kozhovnikov said that the struggle to buy powerful Chinese consumers was intense and even worsening.
He said: "Our goal is to launch 500 businesses through this store within three years. "
At the same time, the platform will also raise products from Russia's far-reaching regional enterprises.
Professor Vyacheslav Cheglov of the Trade Policy Foundation of the Russian University of Lehannov Economics said: " This is a political project on behalf of both sides, as the Russian export centre is a country-owned non-citizen institution " .
"I don't see any highly competitive Russian goods on a large market."
He believed that the project might not be really implemented, but it would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
According to the Russian Federation, the President of the Russian Export Centre, Andrey Slepnev (Andrey Slepnev), during the Eastern Economic Forum, stated that more than 170 Russian companies had published product information on Aliba.com platforms on the largest international distribution line, whether in China or in other countries.

About 50 applications from Russian agricultural enterprises have been received.
The Russian Export Centre News Service said: " In addition to agricultural exhibitions, we will have to hold a business meeting, namely, to establish direct links between entrepreneurs. "

In the past, the car scene was played almost every day at public stations.
Public traffic hours are hard to predict, public traffic and vehicle positions are difficult to find, and public traffic is difficult to deal with, especially in some large cities, road traffic leaders, and the complexity of road traffic in the early hours of the morning, leading to the constant difficulty of ensuring public traffic benchmarks.
To this end, the South-South wisdom-trafficking high-speed map is in the process of exploring the new direction of "Internet+transport" services for the first national "Internet + Smart" service project.
It was reported that the first national "Internet + Smart Cards" in the South-West World, combined high data as well as high-speed vehicles' ETAs, and based on public e-stars and mobile Internet, increased traffic data, and both public wisdom cards and e-Maps were released on public roads, and public communications were expected to be able to reach time.
By means of the Internet + Smart Station card, not only can citizens of Nunyi be able to access public traffic easily, know the actual location of the public vehicle and several stations away from the current station, and also have access to public roads through three red-white-eyed road.
In order to benefit from the "Internet + Smart Station" scientific experience, the people of Nuniki have achieved "a way of accessing public places at the front door, while they have access to the station time, while they have access to access to the public at the time of their arrival " .
On the basis of the real-time public information provided by Internet + Smart Station cards, choose the most suitable route of departure, while also having a reasonable expectation to reduce the tension of cars and thus make it easier to escape.
It's the first 30-year-old show on the outside of New York.
Newspapers were informed by the Beijing City and Field Management Office that this time there were 99 sets of works of art, 30 of which were for the first time for the public, showing the collection and rich collection of art and its traditional culture.

The Deputy Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Management of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Management has provided a good presentation on the number of high-level civilizations under this heading, the number of items, and the cross-border age of exhibitions.
Nearly three of the reference arts are national-level and second-level civilizations, ranging from commercial times to light years.
Over 3,000 years ago, a "oldest" piece of greenery was produced for this time; the large size of the beehives was almost 80 pounds, made up of a whole cluster of beads, and the preservations were complete and very impressive; the monumental monument of the mountain peoples, such as the "Superbition of the " South Collection Book " , was also the first one to be shown to the public.
The Deputy Mayor of Beijing City and Field Management said that this cultural exhibition devoted the spirit of "resurrection" to the culture of "living" civilizations, based on the idea of the "Further Sea" and the "Further Sea" garden, to the collection of "Furtherland" literature, to enable visitors to spread the beautiful wishes of the well-being of the world through visualization of the well-known and deep-fashioned culture, the well-being of the traditional culture of China.
It was announced that the exhibition would continue until 30 January 2020.
The New York Times commented: We are definitely not going our own way.
In response to the White Paper "New Age China and the World" published on 27 years: for 70 years, China's development was successful, mainly because under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people found a way to develop a right path to China's special socialism and to walk along this road firmly.
China's course of development is the choice of history, the choice of people.
Since the recent century, in an environment where poverty has been on the rise and in the developing world, one generation of peasants have asked for refuge on the way to find national survivors.
However, "You're the head of the constitution, the reconnaissance, the parliamentary regime, the multi-party regime, the presidential regime has been thinking, tried, and the outcome is inconceivable."
As long as there are China's Communist Party, there are new China, and the Chinese people are gradually opening up a special socialist path in practice.
The road that China leaves is the path of the happiness of the people of China, the path of the People of China to the resurrection of the People of China, as well as the way in which China and the countries of the world are developing together.
It is because China is in the right way that it can do what it can to become the second largest economy in the world and that the largest countries contribute to global economic growth can continue to make a better world through its own development.
As indicated in the White Paper, this development path in China, in line with China ' s national situation, will be adapted to the needs of the period and will become increasingly evident in the light of the development prospects in advance of the era.
Back in the first place, the Chinese people knew how difficult it was to find a right path; the Chinese people were more grateful for the right path.
The Chinese understand the reason for the South Pacific and understand that others are not necessarily suitable for themselves, but are best suited for themselves.
With such confidence and strategic strength, China has created a miracle for the world.
In the pre-human process of interrelationship, "the end of history" has been called one time.
Today, the success of China's unique socialist path has been announced as the end of "historic conclusion", the collapse of "China's collapse" and the failure of "Socialist failure".
China ' s success has strengthened the confidence of developing countries in the achievement of rich countries and has expanded the way in which developing countries move towards modernization, and has provided experiences and lessons for those who wish to accelerate their development and maintain their own independent countries and nations around the world, in line with their national circumstances.
The world is rich in colors.
China has always respected the right of States to choose their own national path of development.
China does not "enter" foreign models or "export" Chinese models, but will be determined not to remove its own path, achieve its continued development, strengthen its political exchange with countries and contribute to the common achievement of good governance.
In the Fair Work Commission, the chief of the city of Foodworks found that he was hired by a 66-year-old female employee by means of a letter of resignation because he was more willing to employ employees from the Athenian background who had been severely beaten " by the boss.
The Committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton ' s chief, Jianbin Wang, who worked at Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, had been working " very unfair " and could have violated anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. King had taken charge of this store in 2016 and he had been " trying to get rid of me " because she was not a WAY.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairperson of the Commission, conducted a search online and found " Mr. King's previous announcements of recruitment in various Australian employment forums " .
One of the job requirements for these posts is " Ms. First Asia " , the other " First Asian Workers " .
The third column says that he " tends to be more inclined to people outside the sea (likely) " .
Mr. Wang hired Ms. Ayton in April of this year by letter of resignation, which was later claimed to be due to her disability and the alleged lack of cash from $5.10 to $30.
However, Mr. Sams said that Mr. King had dismissed Ms. Ayton's reasons for employment and that there was no evidence.
For three years she's been missing only one job, "lost amount" for a few Australians.
He said that Ms. Ayton had been fired " without her behaviour or expression " .
He said: " I believe that, with the support of the evidence of the announcement of recruitment issued by Mr. King, the real motive of the defender should be that he was more willing to hire a staff member with an Asian background.
In accordance with article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. King ' s conduct constitutes an illegal violation of the law against discrimination and/or the dismissal of the applicant. "
Mr. Sams said that in view of Mr. King's treatment of Ms. Ayton's "audience " , he considered it inappropriate to restore her position.
He should consider paying Ms. Ayton compensation, who was a temporary worker and who paid 26 Australian dollars.
In view of the possible violation of legislation against discrimination and labour relations, Sams stated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the Committee ' s head to consider whether the conduct of Mr. King should be transferred to other bodies in order to investigate possible violations of State or federal law.
He said that Mr. King had no opportunity to respond to Ms. Ayton's alleged dismissal.
He said: " I believe that the defender should have taken unfair and prejudiceful procedures to disengage the applicant, Mr. King, and wait for this opportunity" and he believed it would be right to end the employment of the applicant. "
"He's wrong ... ...and the defendant should be totally ignore any natural fair treatment he has received when he has opened up the petitioner, and it's amazing that he is rude and very unfair. "
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks was a small enterprise, " it must be said honestly that no qualified employer would be able to eliminate employees in the most unfair and dishonest manner recognized in this case. "
He said, "This is ridiculous and very unfair. "

Oliver Wyman, an expert in the interview with Mosin Baroness, said: " I feel very useful in remembering and evaluating cities such as the Vietnam River and the Huming City.
In general, I believe that the future of Viet Nam is quite clear in terms of growth speed and economic development.
I think Vietnam is on the right path and it's doing well.
It is important that Viet Nam know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to promote more economic development. "
Human wisdom is completely changing people's work, exchanges and lifestyles.
It has brought greater efficiency, but also poses a threat to social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, there are now no cities in the world that are prepared to break up the age of human intelligence.

A large number of tourism platforms show that our tourism consumer markets need two prosperity.
According to the country's travel report, it is expected that over 80 million domestic tourists will arrive during the holiday period this year, and more than 75 million people will travel.
There are currently more than 500 urban tourists from the platform, including 100 countries and regions.
According to the Chinese Tourism Institute, last year the national holiday season totaled 726 million domestic tourists, with 9.43 per cent increase.
This year's holiday season will not only improve the number of visitors, but also become the " main rule " of national holiday season.
It is reported that over 3,000 tourists in the country during the holiday period were spent on more than $3,000 and increased over the same period last year, due to the general choice of best-tested products, such as high-quality card hotels, free-of-procurement travel missions, smart young people, and car dealerships.
A similar trend is demonstrated by the planned Mummy Travel Network data, which is used throughout the country's long-distance model, and the "private mission" below is more welcome than last year.
Travel data from the spring revealed that its consumers were more sensitive to pregnancy than to reservice, and that it was " from a slow pace " .
The bird data show that our country's four-line and the planned growth of the following urban tourists is faster than the increase of 30 per cent compared to the increase in the number of areas in which the population is exposed to increased consumption in more regions.
Personalization is a great feature of this year's "11" gold week tour.
Data from the series show that the national holiday rental list is expected to be about 60 per cent higher than the increase and the short journeys of the small public road around the area continue to be heated; the number of private missions is up to 155 per cent higher than the increase.
Share the pleasure as the main purpose of the holiday.

The world's highest-age actor died at 108 years of age.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's top senior director of the World Bank, has been in New York, where he never retired as a guest at 108 years of age, but died of cancer and cancer on 19 days of his life, telling him that he was born at 96 years of age.
According to CNN, when Mansinelli was 8 years old, she moved to the United States and had recently helped to clean up the space in a movie store, and at the age of 12, she began to take a knife to serve as a customer, thus reducing the economic pressure in the home.
Although there was a primary school at the time, there was no postgraduate education.
Robert (Robert), son of Mansinelli, reveals that his father loved his work, and people from all over the world liked him, but his father was diagnosed with cancer this year, and he died about six years before the death of his body, but this was not a retirement, as he imagined he would have to go back to work again.
After his death, 82-year-old Robert said that he now had to find a new actor because he had been able to help him cut his hair.
In the past year, city companies have recovered over $1 billion from their new high-news network.
In order to maintain company prices, maintain company images, start the market share frequently over the next two years and collect the company's value to the market by establishing a way of repurchasing and combining the price of the company's transfer to the market, thereby increasing investor confidence.
The Eastern wealth of Choice data show that in 2017 the capital company used the money for the repurchasing unit was $79 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion in 2018, and since 2019, the capital company A has been repurchasing over $1 billion in total, creating a new increase in the purchase amount of the A unit, and far beyond that previous year.
For the purposes of the repurchasing, the repurchasing portion of the company appears to be similar to the increase in large shares, but there is a significant difference in the implementation of the subject matter, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchasing, and the right to own shares.
In receiving the "Journal Journal" press interview, the Chief of the Maritime Information Advisory Group stated that in November 2018, " an opinion on supporting the market-based repurchasing share " , which had been made more difficult for the sector than for the sector ' s repurchasing, complex decision-making procedures and the problems of the current poor system of stockpiling began to encourage the market-repurchasing share from policy perspectives, and therefore there was a significant increase in the number of repurchasing shares that year.
In January of this year, the Implementing Rules " , issued by the Implementing Rules " , were issued by the IPSAS in January of this year , which expanded the sources of the IPSAS's acquisition of funds and adequately streamlined implementation procedures and led to improved governance arrangements to encourage the implementation of the IPSAS Unit or staff plan.
Following the comments from the Board, the conduct of the repurchasing operation of the shares was more applicable, the repurchasing process was simpler and the repurchasing of the shares was more positive.
In the relatively low-position recovery segment, it also facilitates the efficiency of the use of funds at the top of the market, thereby increasing the level of profits per unit, increasing net asset profit rate and reducing pressure on corporate profit indicators.
In comparison with the increase in the shares, the value of the market-based acquisitions is greater than the share of the market-based companies, as well as the market-led market-value management will and cash flow.
In his view, the price of the unit was underestimated as the main factor in the acquisition of the company at the top of the market, and the price of the company was no longer reflected in the future development prospects of the company, so such companies were worthy of concern to investors but could not go to investment for blind purposes and needed to be concerned about the financing of such companies as well as specific operating conditions.
A large-scale repurchasing company at least shows its developmental confidence and financial strength.
In the case of a company on the A market, it has increased its temperature and normalised its behaviour. Data show that nearly a thousand companies in the city have already been able to re-appropriate the shares this year and that companies in the steel industry have become the property of the re-purchasing market.
China ' s recent progress in the disclosure of returns in China has indicated that the company has accumulated a total of 57.5 million units of unit A through centrally traded transactions, representing 0.315 per cent of the total unit of company, totalling $5.5 million (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchasing unit will be devoted to the entire staff holding plan, including the long-term service plan that was considered by the General Assembly at the start of its consideration.
The Ili unit has been paid $5.92 million for the repurchasing of the shares and has recently been adjusted for the purposes of the repurchasing unit, and the original plan for the repurchasing unit will be used for all of the shares encouraged by the post-execution unit " to " replace " the total repurchasing unit of $183 million, of which $152 million is used for the recapitalisation of the unit ' s assets, and the remaining 3049 million will be used for the cancellation of registration capital " .
The ILI indicated that the cancellation of the repurchasing portion would help further increase the level of income of each unit and effectively improve the investment returns of the company ' s shares.
The TCL Group's progress announcement on 25 September revealed that the TCL Group had a total return of 3.59 per cent and a total cost of $16.5 million.
The TCL Board Office of the Board of Directors of the TCL said to the "Court Journal" journalist that the repurchasing unit would be used for a staff member's plan to encourage or convert into a company that can be transferred into a unit.
The TCL Group maintains established operational strategies for increasing competitiveness and sustainable health development.
Based on the maintenance of the trusts and interests of future corporate investors, the company shares combine the performance of the second market for nearly a year and the integration of factors such as the operation and financial situation of the company, which are planned to use their own funds, their own funds and other ways of financing.
The lead economist of the Pre-School Fund stated that the operation of the capital company's repurchasing shares could, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares that flow on the market and increase the income of each unit on the market, which was an important benefit for the second-level market unit; and that the venturer's willingness to move out of the bank to the bank to withdraw from the shares's repurchasing shares, which greatly boosted market confidence.
In recent years, domestic municipal companies ' repurchasing has been a very good way of boosting the confidence of investors through partial repurchasing, as well as a positive and encouraging approach.
The Central Commission of the University of Leachon, the Long City Commission of the Saunas, remembered the four main ports of Huangawa and the engineering machinery — the New York, the Stigang, the Clearing, the Air Force, and around "the long Sasha from the engineering plant to the intellectualization of " a " small goal " — the creation of a world-led engineering industry group at the top level three and a half years later.
In the long-term design of the world's leading engineering industry group, it is now " the strongest map " .
As a city in the province of the Netherlands, Sasha has spoken this famous word. What's going on?
It's the power of the wind.
The four engineering machines that participated in the dialogue, one of which was covered, covered the sky, the ground, the entire area of the earth: the light planes of the mountain wisdom, the mixed soil transport in the middle section, the three-worked ground flooring machinery, the construction of the railway structure, its "hard force" under the so-called unique sky, are visible to the crowd.
On several occasions, China did not have the right to speak in the construction of engineering machinery.
When Wei moved, China's companies introduced "Go Out" two-wheeled motions, combined with "One-way" initiative on the east wind, acquisitions, mergers, constructions, and launchs into the global engineering industry.
Three of them, the Central and Central Section, the construction of railways and the construction of mountain wisdom, engineering engineering companies, their product value, market ownership, sales, major economic indicators, such as the same type of enterprise, have been largely leading.
It's time for the camera to move.
The " four-pound" mechanical engineering team is the leading enterprise in the global engineering engineering industry.
Who survives and thrives in the lakes of global industry is the hardy place to talk.
In the past years, the global engineering industry has suffered cold, and a number of internationally known engineering machinery has collapsed, but long-term engineering machinery has made companies " milk " as " cold " , self-pressure, self-stampling, transforming through industrial structures, transforming them into smart, not only in the past but also in the health of the body.
It's a political party that gives power to the moon.
The development of the preferential industry, both in terms of active access by enterprises and in terms of government.
As a result of the long-term glory of "all engineering machines", it was in the form of a combination of all industrial links from above to below, a number of related industrial groups were formed and, through the improved business environment, a complete set of services, a simplified process of processing, enterprise development, production and sales costs were significantly reduced.
Good business environment, let the engineering machinery build up business.
History has led Sasha to the creation of a world-leading platform for engineering, when I do not expect it when I do not allow it.
Both Governments and businesses, including those related academics, should seize opportunities, on the other hand, to set goals, to continue to work hard and contribute to the building of the South Power.
The Queen presides over a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and members of the Council.
The King said that China and the African countries were good brothers and good partners.
In the past, now and in the future, China stands firmly with the African brothers.
We advocate the holding of this Foreign Presidential Meeting, which is a concrete initiative to implement the important consensus reached at the meeting of the African Cooperation Forum in Beijing last September with the leaders of African countries, in order to strengthen cooperation between China and the African countries in solidarity with the Council, in order to better support the international community in achieving peace and development in Africa.
The King stated that Africa was the most important and trusted partner in China.
As a permanent member of the Council, China has always been a major developing country, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China, together with the Council and African States, is willing to strengthen solidarity and maintain common interests.
Both parties should rely on the strength of solidarity, on consultation, on self-reliance and on developmental governance.
The Foreign Member States of Africa were grateful for the Chinese initiative to hold this meeting and welcomed the establishment of the new China for the 70th anniversary.
Foreigners indicated that non-interferences were established on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and Africa and China were always the most reliable and demanding partners.
Non-Stately, China, as a permanent member of the Council, has played an important active role in Africa ' s affairs and has contributed to the promotion of a just and just solution to Africa ' s problems and great efforts and contributions to the protection of the interests of Africa and to promote peace in Africa.
Africa is currently facing a threat of terrorism and extremism, and only addressing security issues can Africa really achieve long-term peace development.
I look forward to further coordination with China in the Council and strengthening cooperation in solidarity.
The King said that today's meeting had reached an important consensus.
We all support multilateralism, strengthen the authority and role of the United Nations, protect the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations against unilateral and degrading practices; we all agree to strengthen cooperation between Central African countries in the United Nations and the Council, to maintain the common interests of the countries of Central Africa and the developing countries; we all support African countries in Africa ' s resolution of African issues, calling for the financial support of the United Nations for autonomous peace operations in Africa; we all support "cooperation for development, development" concept to help African countries achieve self-sustainable development; we firmly maintain the legitimate interests of developing countries against any country to create obstacles to development and deny the right to development.
Günnnücken: The sheep of the lake are coming out of poverty.
In September the soil was contaminated.
The 58-year-old Shevili, a civil-profit professional cooperation company in Juma City, adds the last piece of food in the sheep's yard and keeps it on the side of the hill and looks at the white sheep's mouth.
"It's good to eat, and when the winter is full, you can sell it at great cost."
Shaville said he gave the sheep "special food " every day, regularly to treat health care, to kill drugs, and to be patient.
Shavil has fed over 20 years of sheep until the cooperative has worked, knowing how poor sheep have been left behind in the past.
Shevili is a village in the town of Zheung-Jung-Sung-Sung-Sung-Sung.
His left-hand side is a shepherd, but he insists on traditional ways of breeding, sheep's quality, and sheep's size.
In June of this year, under the direction of the Government, 140 poor people in the villages joined the cooperative and all began to change.
Shevili also had her first birthday because he always had one thing in his heart.
Those in the unit are poor houses, they're all handed over to the cooperatives, they can't share red, they're selling, they're waiting for him.
With the guidance of a technical person, he slowly learned how to prevent infections, had a scientific upbringing, and became a " good practice " in the village.
It is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep and nearly 1400 sheep.
The Co-operative Manager said that there was a lot of doors outside of the standardized sheep.
"The sheep are dark, vulnerable to germination, the sheep are not allowed to stay in hot spots, the sheep must be built around and dressed in exchange for air. "
In order to prevent vaccines, it is also necessary for the treatment of foot-and-mouth disease and for one quarter of the sheep to have three to four vaccinations.
In addition to living well, "little sheep" must be eaten with vegetables such as wheat, corn, corn, and so on, and have enough extensive "playing" to make cheese.
Cooperatives have taken care of their livelihoods, leading local farmers to invest good sheep here, to unify their livelihoods, management, sales, well-being, scientificization, standardization and collective cultivation.
Today, more than 6,000 reds per year have been built with 140 poor households in the sheep unit, four of whom work in cooperatives.
From "full of mountain pasture" to "farmer" , from "local share" to "people workers " , from "looks, leaves" to "b" as "b" . ...in the spring, sheep breeding is not only a way of feeding , but rather a change in the pattern of "principal business+co-operation+farmer" in the form of "parchments on the mountain , collects sheep in the city" and overcomes the weak part of traditional farming and the poor days of the farmers because modern shepherds become well-emerged.
It is said that, if market prices are low, local companies will be able to expand their agricultural development by cutting down on low-priced farms, which will help farmers to share market risks with the market base of 27 kilograms per kilogram.

France's finance said the next year would reduce the tax rate by EUR 1 million and call for Germany to proceed.
On Thursday, 26 September, the French financial director, Bruno Le Maire, said that France would reduce its tax rate by EUR 100 billion (US$ 1090 million), while Germany should follow the financial incentives of France to re-establish the economy.
In introducing the French budget for 2020, Lemer stated that the latest European Central Bank monetary disbursement initiative created an additional investment opportunity for Member States with capacity.
The European Centre landed on 12 September to record new lows and planned to reopen its debt to reduce borrowing costs, hoping to stimulate economic recovery and increase the rate of inflation.
" Low interest rates will not bring Europe back to its current prosperity, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough," Lemer said to the journalist.
"Germany needs to invest, now needs to be better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse," he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany several times.
France has implemented more than EUR 100 billion this year, which has contributed greatly to France ' s economic growth.
And the global economy has lost its momentum, depending on the German economy's export leader.
Lemer noted that the tax burden for the French family would reduce the amount of €9.9 billion next year, including the tax relief of €500 million.
In addition, corporate tax rates will decrease from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over the five years, while corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly EUR 100 million.

Research: A small increase in U.S. health eating indicators, but still having challenges in the new network
A recent study by the United States of America showed that, in 16 years, the U.S. Government's health food index has grown to 58.
But in the case of 100 minutes, this is not worth celebrating.
American citizens are still facing " significant challenges " while eating.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Tavez University of Massachusetts, stated that Americans are still getting too much food that can lead to heart disease, diabetes, diabetes, and diabetes, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published on 24 days in the U.S. Medical Journal.
The study was based on the conclusions of the United States Government's health survey of 4.4 million adults between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote: " Despite tangible improvements, significant food challenges remain " .
These challenges were reported to include reducing the consumption of food for the United States of America, including wheat and barley.
Studies have found that people's intake of these unhealthy foods increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, beyond 10% of the recommended intake.
The biggest improvement in U.S. food is that the intake of sugar decreased from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the volume of intake is still high.
Officially, the amount of added sugar should be less than 10 per cent.
For reasons of reducing sugar intake, researchers believe that the reduction in sugar intake is related to the reduction in sugar intake, but stress is stressed that sugar-types are often added to non-sugar foods such as sugar and sugar.
American adults have a small increase in their intake of food from fruit, vegetables, vegetables and other types of whole grains.
However, the 2016 data showed that these food levels remained below 5 per cent of the daily food consumption.
Despite a slow reduction in the intake of the particles, the decrease in the intake of low-quality hydrocarbons has resulted in a decrease in the intake of low-quality hydrocarbons, however, it has been shown that they are still at a temperature of 42 per cent more per day, many of which are from the white surface of processing and other stimulants.
This study is based on an individual health survey every two years, which will bring to mind the food they eat within 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.
The U.S. Food Guide on Food, published by the Government, recommends that people use " healthy eating patterns " to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The Guide notes that more food should be absorbed into food intensively, such as food, fruit, whole grains, low milk products, and can be supplied with protein, meat, meat, poultry, eggs, seed-type food.
During the IP, the number of people suffering from diabetes in the United States increased almost once and more by over 7 per cent, and the rate of obesity increased during the many years of the movement — such as today’s 70 per cent adults who are overweight or who are pregnant.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of death for U.S. citizens.

The most deep record of the Chinese railways has been printed.
On 27 September, the New Hampshire National Park (Central Park) was built for over 1200 days of night construction, completed on 27 September at the foot of Mount Lisbon, and reached the ground below 762.59 meters, and destroyed the deepest record of the Chinese Railway Railways, which was created in large quantities of water.
The Highway Highway of the Alley of the Great Lakes, 34.5 km long, is located in the south-western part of the mountain range, which is the longest in the Asian bi-line.
This road passes over 19 sections and covers a maximum of 1155 metres, since almost all road construction workers are exposed to the negative and serious risks that can be identified as the " geological museum " built by the mountain of the hill.
The bridge is the most important support route in the mountain range, and the bridge is responsible for increasing the operation of the "long-distance" and the later railway traffic.
Number 1 successfully landed at the bottom of the well, marking the formal entrance of the High Mountain Road to the levelway construction, which could increase four operating areas and speed up the flow of the tunnel.
"The whole area of the flower tree, the size of which is more than the size of the flowering area, the depth of which is more than the distance from the water to the bottom of the stream, is basically the size of the depth of the water."
The Director-General's Director-General for Engineering of the Central Road Project of the Office of the Central Bank told reporters that there was a number of accidents in the mining industry, such as drought, drought, and construction, and invited experts to the site to study the treatment program for the remaining 20 studies.
"The largest inland waterway, up to 300 metres per hour, and 700 metres deep, is equivalent to 700 metres deep. "
The show said, "If it wasn't time to draw water, one hour would take 10 meters, we'd be almost 85 percent time to fix it, and 15 percent time to get it in."
In order to overcome the development of the 1st circle of the wall, tortoise water, geogeographical problems such as well-favoured water wells, to use "exploration, notes, " integrated system water management measures to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, the construction of the 1st floor has created an open-up system, an exhaust system, an exhaust system, a motorized flow line such as the vehicle upgrade system, an explosion, an explosion, an outlet, a model installation, a meteorological operation such as the mixed-templated floors, and accelerated construction progress.
Finally, after more than 1200 days of night construction, it was successfully completed with a depth of 762.59 metres.
It is an important component of the Middle East international road and an important transport infrastructure for the construction of "one road".
After the construction of a motor vehicle, largely due to the 6-hour drive time of Reyrie, the road will be reduced to 2 hours, and the road transport system will be significantly improved in the West Bank region and will often contribute to the promotion of cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries and friends.

"11" is a long-term consumer survey: choose more than a tourist priority.
The President of the State has been lying close, and people's holiday plans have been gradually established.
The "Court Journal" newspaper recently launched a small survey on "11" holiday arrangements in a friend's circle, showing that although all plans differ, "Tourism+ consumption" is the key word for "11" holiday season.
In particular, more than half of the people chose to travel in response to the "Court Day" of the press.
" During the " 11 " period, the plan was for families to travel over the sea, Disini was the first stop and then to travel around the city " ; one of Beijing's women chose to travel to our country, " a three-day trip from Taiwan on 28 September and a ten-day holiday on the island " ; a re-sounded young lady planned to travel to Singapore for a purpose; a voice from the north of the river was chosen from the beach, saying " The daughter is not two years old, she is not too easy, she is planning to go up to the mountains and play on the coast " .
The joint "Report of the 2019 Golden Rounds and the Trends" published by the Coalition Coalitions and Coalition Travellers show that this year's Gold Week is on its way out and is on its way to stay, and that there is a clear trend in consumption growth in three areas.
Aeroplanes, high-speed high-speed upwards, star-level hotels and individualized non-marked accommodation requirements are higher.
On 23 September, the United States "Tourism trends report for tourism" showed that tourism consumption continues to deteriorate and that the situation of "eating" is becoming more and more multi-progressive.
More young people are looking for high quality greens, with special experiences, cultural tourism, inter-night tourism.
In addition to tourism, various types of consumer needs are also concentrated during the "11 " period.
Mr. King of the House said to the paper newspaper, "This year's main plan is to buy cars."
In Beijing, 4S car ticket staff reported to the "Court Journal" journalist that it was common to say that in September each year, gold was sold in October.
There will be a number of activities during the "11 " portals, such as the prize, to reduce the size of the store.
A number of new types of vehicles have also recently been introduced, and new products are expected to be more evident in terms of the impact of savings.
Under the trend of consumer growth, consumption of services, such as culture and education, is more important than ever increasing.
" Since the birth of children, culture and education have become the major cost of family consumption, Ms. Dou of Beijing.
This year's "11" is completed to go to the "Bangka's" theater, the Children's Theatre, about a few weeks later to the "Chief" museum and the "Chiefs" camp, and arranges for some hearing tests. "
It was stated that, theoretically, the growth in the consumption of the population was driven by sustainable consumption to developmental consumption and to the enjoyment of consumption, some of which enjoyed a relatively small part of the consumption of services.
As our economic society continues to grow and the level of income of the population continues to grow, people are increasingly focusing on their mental needs, tourism and tourism as a good way of doing so.
In particular, the "11" country's long-term holiday is more time-consuming and people are more willing to travel and consume, which is both able to meet their spiritual needs and represents an increase in the consumption of the population.
In the morning, it began to rain, and it wasn't ready to go out, and it didn't fit the children's condition.

In detail, some of the things that were to be done out of the door, the characteristics of blood type A are becoming increasingly strong and they feel very different.
Buy clothes, buy food, pay, buy fish, Nana's little meat.
More than that, it's the reason for the door.
On the phone, she just had a lot of fun talking about her sister's love, but she didn't even buy a little food.
There's a lot of noise on that side of the street, and the kid's coming over and he's gone.
Nana's car jumps out of her hands and she's down the road. She knows she's driving, she's scared, and she's not happy to be with me.
My husband Boo's coming back early.
She even gave me a good meal of three-pound eggs and then went to the bathroom and watched TV on her bed.
Look at the wall, just at 7:00 a.m., and the sun's rising early, and the sun's down.
It's been months in my friend's circle. It's been a long day.
He washed a friend's purse and left half to Boo, and left the rest in a favorite little flower and went out to see the moon.
And Nana's sitting on the ground, I ate her skin, and I used her hair as far away as I could.
The light of the moon is hidden in the darkness, and the light of the moon is hidden from the light.
The brain is full of words about the moon, and it has a clear preference for the word: each of the three five groups round/full of the light shield/last round/one round of the human beings.
Maybe we're giving too much of the moon's color, and I'm talking about what I'm talking about now, in fact, that's God's return to God, Caesar's reward is best.
The moon turns into the moon, the love of you.
It's finished. This mission is cold.
Nana had a small voice at her feet, stood up, and put her little hair on her side of her small house, and Nana welcomed her to sit on top of it.
Open the door. Are you ready to wash the water?
The window from the bathroom is not looking for the moon. It only feels the moon, closes the light of the bathroom, and opens the window.
I didn't eat the moon. I didn't drink.

Has Malawi been elected to the D.A. meeting?
The President of Malawi, Mr. Nassausrei, said: " Talk to the Supreme Council on Foreign Affairs! "
The country's vice-president, Denmark, is concerned about whether the country's country of origin is based on Malawi.
However, after the meeting of the Commission of Malawi, it was announced by the Supreme Council to decide whether it continued to be replaced by the Mawau position or by other member parties.
At 4 p.m. after the chairmanship of the Commission of Malawi, he indicated to the media that any alternative would be made by the State in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP), that is to be established after the meeting of the Supreme Council of the State.
He said that, given that the election committee would meet on the following week (1), it was expected that the meeting of the Supreme Council would be held early in October.
" Yesterday (26 o'clock) I also met with President Nassuzrea Zashi yesterday, and we all agree with the need to re-elect this House from the Union ' s side. "
" We are going to hold a special meeting of Heads of State in early October, and the three-party party will determine which party will be represented by which party. "
Asked whether it would maintain its traditional seats with the Supreme Council of the State and the House of Lords reiterated that he, as President of Malawi, had to act in accordance with the standard operating procedures and that any decision had to be made by the State.
"In any case, there are people who are willing to sign up, there are political parties, there is some way they think they should come out, this is a thing that's a good thing for the Division. "
"The most important thing is that we are from what organization and political union?"
"This is a great test of our political union for many years, and we believe that the country is on its way to hold some valuable values. "
"In this process, maybe someone will say something, it's weird. "
"But when the Supreme Council decides, it is necessary for all to make every effort to fight, which is the most valuable. "
In any case, the House of Lords indicated that Malawi would be prepared at the three-level meeting, i.e. in the districts, by the State Council and the Central Council, with all its efforts to prepare for the upcoming elections in Denmark.
" The Council will be led by the President of the District Council (Denzobea) on the day of Nassuriju; the State Council will be led by the President of the Council of the United States Council; and, in the case of central, by the Director-General, Nassos Mansou and the Secretary-General, on their own deployment.

The people of a village in the north of the lake are charged with the obligation to hunt wild animals.
A village in the North Sea for the purpose of catching wild animals was sentenced to 15420 dollars in compensation for environmental damages to the North Sea (people's currency, below).
As a result of the poverty of the family of the accused, the prosecution authorities have opened up alternative work compensation costs for eco-rehabilitation and have reached an opportunity to achieve legal and social effects.
The Deputy Prosecutor-General of the Department of Defence presented on 27 February that, through alternative work, such as the "obligatory mountain " , the defendant had established a deep feeling for a week and a wild pigeon and had been responsible for the previous hunting of animals.
On 21 June this year, a criminal case involving criminal contributions in the field of organic resources, which was brought before the Court of Caucasian Court, was publicly tried and before the Court of Justice.
The defendant was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment a week, four years ' imprisonment, and 3,000 dollars ' fines and 15420 dollars ' compensation for environmental damage.

The fungi belong to the national level of endangered wild animals, and the bats are listed as " the national list of protected wild animals of animal origin " .
During the trial of the Tribunal, a person was denied his or her false facts and conduct and was willing to assume additional civil responsibilities.
However, taking into account the poor economic situation of some of the people of the week, the local village commission, the forest station, has reached an alternative job reimbursement agreement by a third party in coordination with the Ministry of the Protection of Coalition, which is to say that it is necessary to provide for the provision of public benefits for the rehabilitation of work through the work of the district of the village.
With regard to the Prosecutor ' s recommendation, the Court acknowledged that it agreed to implement the leave for a week and actively fulfil its obligation to "reimburse alternative work costs for eco-rehabilitation".
At present, someone has worked for three months in the area of protection duties, and the mountain is active and well behaved.

The United Nations has issued " Earthguard Awards " for "The Rain Forests "
In a warm tone of voice and rehearsal of music, the head of the "Wonderful Forest" project and the user's representative were thrilled to go to the leading platform and received a United Nations "Golden" award in 2019 from the president.
The 2019 Earth Guard Award was held in New York, U.S.A., on 26th anniversary of the "Estimulation and Action Award" of the "Stimulation and Award" project involving millions of people participating in environmental operations.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced a list of prizes at the headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but those who participated in the award still had difficulty.
When the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Mr. Angelano, accepted a New York City press interview, he said that "The Rain Forest" was an exciting innovation that enabled billions of people to take action to understand what the environmental challenges faced by mankind and what humans can do for the environment.
It combines technology with the environment and enables each body to participate in actions to protect the Earth, which will have a significant impact.
In August 2016, "Puncho Forest" was launched by the Chinese Financial Service Group on Winging (Cinnian Gold) to pay off the precious platform and to record the greenness of its daily life in "Punji Forests", to collect " green energy " from low-carbon operations, such as online payment of electricity " , on the phone " . "
Every time the user grows a tree, "The Forests" and public partners will be the next tree in the desert area.
As of August of this year, 5 million "Puncho Forests" users have reduced their carbon consumption by 792 million tons, and they have grown to 1.22 million tons in desert areas.
In the " Earthguard Award" issued on that day, Costa Rica ' s national security efforts were rewarded, and the former Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who was present at the award, praised the contribution of "The Rain Forest", " which could stimulate so many people to participate in green action and give them a deep impression " .
The Chief Chief of Staff of Staff and Chief Executives of Staff said "The Earth Guard Award" was certain of the "Water Forests" project.
The technical and open platform makes it possible for people to participate in low-carbon life, which is an honour for all participants.
In the past three years, the "Sweet Forests" has affected 5 billion people, and in the future three "Sweet Forests" has been aimed at encouraging the global involvement of 100 million people in low carbon operations.
In combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how incomes from farmers derive more from green water.
In addition to the provision of employment opportunities through trees, it is also hoped that the electromagnetic platform will help farmers achieve their growth through agricultural development projects.
The model of public environmental protection based on digital technologies created by the " Forests " has also been successful and taken into account by other countries.
In June of this year, the largest "GCash electronic money package" launched the "GCash Forest" version of the Philippines, encouraging the Philippines user to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
The GCash will join the Philippines Environment and Natural Resources Ministry, such as environmental welfare organizations, and plan to launch 365 million trees within the Philippines within a year.
"The Earth Guard Award" is the highest award in the United Nations field of environmental protection, issued once a year.
After the thousands of village models and village governance projects, the Chinese green innovation project continued in the third year of China's "Incentive and Action Award" following the "Incentives and Awards" project.
The U.S. " performance list " has an impact on the US economy.
The United States ' second quarter economic success list this year shows that private sector investment and exports have a significant downward impact and that the United States GDP increase is significantly slower than the above season.
The analyst noted that the uncertainty of trade and its effects was a factor that led to private sector investment and export downturns in two quarters.
The final amendment data published on 26 April by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that the United States GDP grew by 2 per cent at the rate of 2 per cent in the second quarter of the United States, while significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
Data show that consumption growth is a major factor in the economic growth of the United States of America in the second quarter of the year.
As a total of approximately 70 per cent of the United States economy consumption is increased by 4.6 per cent during the season and by 3.03 per cent in slow economic growth.
In addition, Government consumption expenditure and investment slow economic growth were 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in two-quarters decreased by 6.3 per cent at the highest rate, resulting in a drop in economic growth by 1.16 per cent during the second quarter; a drop in exports by 5.7 per cent, and a net export drop by 0.68 per cent at the highest rate.
The management of private sector investment not only has been able to sustain growth in the past year but has been significantly reduced by economic and uncertain rise in business confidence, as well as by economic and business confidence.
Knap believed that, under the uncertainty of policy implications, future U.S. capital expenditure was expected to remain below the current situation.
The analysis suggests that although consumption growth has created a strong impact on the United States economy for the second quarter, more and more signs have shown that the uncertainty of trade and its consequences have affected consumer confidence and has a negative impact on the future of the United States consumption.
Researchers, Professor of Economics, Chad Quentin, University of Michigan, noted that 38 per cent of consumers in the recent survey reported the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new one-and-a-half-year increase.
For future economic developments in the United States, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, there was also an expert saying that, if trade had been eased, the performance of the United States industry and financial markets would have improved.
British economists Global economist Kevin Berchi expects that the future United States economy will continue to slow down its trend since this year and increase to a level of less than two quarters.
MUDI's lead economist, Mac Zaddy, predicted that this year's economic growth would be 2.3 per cent and that the next year would be further slowed to 1.6 per cent.
The investment manager of the Patton Investment Company, Ellen Hae, noted that the biggest concern of the current business is the uncertainty of trade and its consequences, and that if trade can be resolved, uncertainty would be significantly reduced and the industry's performance would be much better than now.
Méli, a member of the Miller-Tabakka asset management company, said that the business remains " the main issue " , which is also the main cause of the major fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year, which will be key to affecting the movement of the US capital market in the rest of the year.

Minister of Finance: 67 Central Pensions and Financial Institutions have been transferred to the National Fund for Real Society Security of $86.1 billion.
On 27 June, the Minister for Finance stated that there are currently 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions with capital-additional security funds in transfer countries and that the total capital-transport country has approximately US$86 billion.
On that day, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security, and the national transfer countries jointly convened by the National Finance Commission, had the mandate of the Fund to develop capital-compliant Societies.
" The capital-compliant capital-intensive security fund is an important initiative for reforming and improving the basic old-age insurance system, a full representation of the gender-based shared and basic old-age insurance system for business development results and a sufficient number of long-term policy measures. "
In 2017, the State Department issued " a programme for the implementation of capital-intensive Societies Guarantee Fund " , which called for the selection of a part of central enterprises and part provinces to be piloted.
According to the report, the forwarding work has had a positive effect.
At the central level, three sets of 67 joint ventures and central financial institutions have been completed, with a total capital of approximately US$86 billion.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions to which the Ministry of Finance has performed its functions has been essentially completed.
Central enterprise transfer has a certain size.
At the local level, pre-term work on enterprise transformation was carried out on a continuous basis.
As at the end of 2018, Zhao-Qaida had completed its pilot work in the two provinces of the South and had $15.5 million in capital allocated to the countries concerned.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have carried out their pre-term preparatory work and have established the basis for the next phase of implementation.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security, the National Finance Commission, the Directorate-General for Taxation, the joint issuance of notifications prior to the Day of the Credentials Board, the Credentials and the Central and Local Transfer Countries have a comprehensive start in 2019 and the completion of a basic completion by the end of 2020.
The meeting that was held on that day was specifically deployed for the full phase-out of translation work.
The Conference stressed the need for effective completion of the translation work.
" In accordance with the progressive arrangements, the transition work will be essentially completed by the end of 2020.
It's hard work, heavy work."
It is said that, in each region, sectoral organizations need to be carefully organized, closely arranged to ensure that translation is completed as required; that progress is made and that policy elements are accurately translated; that communication coordination and timely solutions to the issue of doubts are strengthened.
The National Fund for the Transfer of Real Estate Guarantee Fund — issued from the beginning of the "Completal Societies Fund" — is intended to provide a strong contribution to the maintenance security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple unit " physical transfer " but a " mathematical law " .
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Rights, the National Finance Commission, the General Tax Administration, the Credentials Board issued a joint notice " on the work of the Comprehensive Development Fund for Capital-Environment-Entrepreneuranced Countries " , a timetable for the Comprehensive Implementation of the Credentials-Environment Fund, which was published by the Central and Local Transferred-Accession Fund in 2019.
After the publication of the document, the financial sector, such as the Ministry of Finance, was implemented quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance will transfer the business bank held, 10 per cent of the shares of the Agricultural Bank's right to a company security fund, and two units will transfer the total value of more than $11,500 million.
According to the provision, entities such as the Social Security Fund as a financial investor enjoy the right to income rights of the included State with unitary rights, the right to disposal and the right to information.
In the press, agriculture indicated that this change of interest would not result in changes in the original and actual control of the unit.
In this regard, it was felt that the conversion of the same State Entrepreneurship Act was not a simple change in the inheritance of the Unit, but rather a " legal settlement " that could stimulate a series of effects.
The first step of the State ' s transfer guarantee " is that it is natural for the State to have a business for all its citizens and to share the development results with all its citizens.
Over the years of reform, the country has focused, in particular, on the major sectors and areas of our economy, which are stronger and more stable in overall profit-making capacity.
Among them, mining companies are more and more continuing to do their best.
On 10 July, the Permanent Meeting of the State Service decided that this year a comprehensive extension of the capital-intensive social security fund would be undertaken by the transition countries.
The Ministry of Finance immediately indicated that it would meet with the relevant sectors, in accordance with the deployment of the Permanent Meeting of the State Chambers, to fully promote the work of the capital-in-corporate Societies Trust Fund for Transit Countries, which represented the full participation of all citizens in the basic old-age insurance system in the generation of equity and the results of business development of the State.
The second phase of the " results of legislation " , which has been translated, is the strengthening of the sustainability of my National Social Security Fund and the further strengthening of the old social security system.
With population ageing, our community security funds are under pressure, and this time as a country-owned resource, most of which have sustained profits and redundancy, it is not only possible to supplement the social security fund effectively but also provide source-based water for the social security fund.
It has been estimated that each conversion of 3.8 per cent of countries has capital, i.e. one per cent of the holdings of basic old-age insurance can be supported by enterprises.
The third step, translated " results of legislation " , is an increase in the stability of the capital market.
The way in which this transfer of income is obtained by the subject of the transfer is " red-headed and carried out as a supplement " .
As a financial investor in the capital of the State, the Social Security Fund is indeed the master of the share of red income.
As investors in the capital market, however, the social security fund has a stronger capital operating capacity.

U.S. Senate approval of Skariya as Minister of Labour - New York Network
The United States Senate on 26 September in Washington, New York, has voted on the nomination of President Taranup to Mr. Yukin Scarria as Minister of Labour.
The vote was adopted by 53 votes to 44 with none in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Co-Parties believed that the experience of Skariya made him very suitable as Minister of Labour.
However, it appears to the Democratic Party that Skariya has been standing in the face of workers and trade unions for a long time during the life of lawyers.
It will replace Alexander Acosta.
As a result of the " extensive treatment of the United States of America ' s billions of girls involved in alleged rape and trafficking in girls, the Minister of Labour, Augusta, announced her resignation in July this year.
Skariya is now 56 years of age, a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States whose father has been the judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Ministry of Labour is a branch within the United States Government of the United States of America, which is responsible for labour-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement on that day that Taranup had appointed the body officially led by Peter Gena, Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency.
In accordance with the procedure, the nomination of Ghana is also required to be approved by the Senate of the National Assembly.
The Federal Emergency Measures Programme is the United States Ministry of Land Security, which is responsible for coordinating the resources of the federal Government to deal with natural disasters in the United States, emergency incidents such as terrorist attacks and follow-up.
Since its first appearance in the 35th anniversary of the formation of the military in the country, each organization has become a "great-grandsome" side of the strategic missile force.
"The first time that the rockets were attacked by the army was after the 'military' became 'arms' . "
The commander of the command of the Firearming Team said.
The presence of the armed forces is highly appreciated for their ability to eat, to fight, to fight, to fight, to give special attention to the spirit of dedication, to serious training, to the training of the army, and to show good strategic military images and to give greater attention to serious winding events.
This time of military training, whether general or military, requires strict standards for the construction of mines and ordering heavy air-conditioning.
They also focus on the spirit of generosity, taking every detail of technology, skill, training and wind, forming a feature such as "majority, speeding up, speaking clarity" and creating an increasingly serious windmilling platform that focuses more on scientific innovation.
As a high-tech strategic army, the rocket army is a well-established and innovative one.
This time, they were trained by the military, based on their previous experience, to break the pattern of vision, break traditional approaches, use satellite positioning, amplifiers, high imagery, real-time speed analysis, improve training levels and quality efficiency, ensure that vehicles are combined in good order, and that the team's actions are not bad and are more in line with the standards of war.
The armed forces are supported by the same standard of access to the military and launch sites, which is more demanding to accommodate each port, to force every detail, to allow the troops to be caught by fire, and to truly allow the State to access military stations as training and training stations for enhancing the force's fighting force.

In accordance with the nuclear agreement, Iran can only set up a first-generation IR-1 in Natanz (Natanz) in order to collect carbon monoxide, and only allow Iran to use a small amount of advanced aircraft as a study but not to produce carbon monoxide.
Iran's successful development of advanced decoupling machines will allow for a rapid slowdown in its production rate, which can be used for the production of nuclear bombs.
It was reported that the International Atomic Energy Agency report stated: " On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that aircraft type 2 and aircraft type 3 had advanced heart failure ... ... are being collected or ready to be collected. "

In order to ensure the safety of passengers and the current policy requirements of the vehicle, a security officer shall be equipped at the parking lot and shall be maximum guaranteed by passengers.
During the course of the journey, vehicles can perform smart changes based on road conditions and can also determine the driving conditions of the vehicles around them and automatically avoid situations such as the distance from the vehicle.
Throughout the test, the travel area's screen shows road drivers, cars, and even some traditional blind areas.
Even if the vehicle is jammed, it can be seen in advance for information such as the change in front of the red sky and waiting for time, and all the road conditions are obvious.

China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper notes that China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper says that as China's combined national and international influence rapidly increased, some international concern was expressed by China ' s " strong " path, and some suggested " China ' s threat " .
This has been known as a well-known misreading, deep-rooted prejudice, strong mental imbalances that have led to the removal of the mental imbalances, and has resulted in a sharp disturbance in the maintenance of their own interests.
The realization of the country ' s wealth, the people ' s well-being, the people ' s happiness, both the dream of the people of China and the common dream of the peoples of all nations.
" China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge. "
The White Paper noted that China was the main stabilization and source of global economic growth, China was the largest contributor to world economic growth, China ' s technological innovation was introduced into the world economy ' s new momentum, and China ' s future stabilization and the role of energy sources was more evident.
Today, the world's economic growth is inadequate and the Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-quality growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, rapid progress in agricultural modernization, deep economic structural adjustment, sustained improvements in industrial improvement, and new economic growth.
" The study of the Mackenzie Global Research Institute believes that by 2040, China and other economies in the world are expected to create an economic value of $22 billion to $37 billion, equivalent to 15 - 26 per cent of the total global economy, and that increased cooperation between other economies and China will create a huge economic value. "
The White Paper emphasizes that China ' s economy and the world economy have been structured and deeply integrated.
Economic operations are more stable, higher quality of growth, and China ' s prospects for growth are long-term benefits to world economic development.
Viewing China ' s economic development as " threat" and " challenge " as an attempt to pull China out of the global industry chain, supply chain, value chain, link China to the world economy " is both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper notes that openness on the part of the whole creates more opportunities for countries to share " Chinese Red Cross " abroad.
China is firmly determined not to move towards an open strategy for mutual benefit, to achieve greater strength, to open up to higher levels, to have the world's most potential consumer markets, to be the most attractive investment destination in China, and to move out "for the benefit of more countries."
" The opening should be bilateral, mutually beneficial and not one-way and beneficial.
Both benefits can last a long time."
The White Paper states that China has committed itself to continuing to expand its imports, to extend market access, to improve the business environment, to strengthen intellectual property protection, and that other countries should also expand openness and take appropriate initiatives to work towards improving their own business environment.
The only way that all parties can produce an open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial development environment is by increasing the growth of the "product" of development together and creating a mutually beneficial community of interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
Including the promotion of high-quality " one-way " , with multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, active participation in international and regional affairs and active external assistance.
" China ' s development benefits the international community, and never forgets its return to international large international families, providing better public products to the international community. "

Russia is interested in promoting diversification of supply in these areas and promoting the export of deep processing products.
He stressed that Russia was going to move its exporters to the global value added chain, one of which was China ' s development direction.
Manufacturers in the areas of Russian agriculture, coal, oil and coal are fully able to participate in this process.
At present, two countries need to continue to deepen their cooperation between enterprises, " establishing more inter-Russian co-financing enterprises and joint development of exports to third countries " .
Srepnoov stated that the Russian Export Centre was taking a number of measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Office and the Russian Export Bank to support the export of Russian products.

He wrote on 24 days: " I have no doubt that continuing to let the ultimate rule of Cessie cause disaster. "
"He's right down there in line with the interests of Egypt."
Prior to Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who served as Egypt's former military adviser, was arrested by Chief Anzo.
Anja was arrested last year after she was arrested by President Cessie.
The President of the Constitutional Party was also arrested.
Analysts and political figures believe that, at this time of increasing economic hardship for the poor and middle-income, the dissident practices reflect the instability and vulnerability of the Government.
The opposition leader Ayman Nour once quoted President Nour as saying: " The arrest of the people of the regime is evident to the people of Egypt, as well as how frightening it is. "
" Since the economy has been achieved by him, as well as by the general implementation of political pressure, Cessie has tried to convey the important message of leadership and political people as possible. "
Norr noted that the Government's use of high-pressure measures only increases the anger of the people, as long as the socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.
Since the threat of terrorism has already been broken, he expects more people to go on the street.
The current Spanish businessman and actor Ali was a contractor for military construction in Egypt, who started to broadcast a series of videos early in his month, which, as a result of government corruption, benefited from the release of small demonstrations at the end of the week in different cities.
Ali said that his company's general contract, Amarak, was not required through the legal tender process, so it was possible to obtain a favourable contract, stressing that the security forces and relatives, including Mrs. Amer al-Sisi (Intissar Amer al-Sisi), were involved in corruption.
He was deeply sorry for his involvement.
Ali claimed that he had helped the Queen of the Holy See and the Huguenot Hotel in Cessiege, which was clearly compared to the extreme poverty of the people of Egypt at the time, and had not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, such as " You're not alone " , " You're done " , " Cessie " , " Cessied " , " Next Friday " has attracted hundreds of thousands of copies and returns, including calls for the people to go to the streets in a peaceful way to ask for Cessie's table.
There are nearly 7 million followers in the Tuat of the Red Sea of Egypt.
He wrote in Arabic yesterday: "Secret's appointment is over... he's done, and he's going to make a big mistake now. "

"For the first time." Two high-performance presses.
On 26 days, from the east to the south, ± 1100,000 high-pressure power stations, and over 1,000 high-pressure GIL integrated power stations.
Both of these projects, based on the high levels of current world power transmission technology in their respective fields, would significantly increase the scope of our energy efficiency after the explosion.
The Director-General of the National Energy Agency has wisely stated that the world's largest power source of electricity from the east to the south is the remotest power plant.
Its inputs are important to promote the development of new energy bases and to ensure electricity supply in the West Bank.
GIL, that's a gas-depleting metal shut-down line.
The U.S. Commanding Engineering has created the highest global pressure level for GIL, the highest capacity record for transport, and the " exchange of bi-cycle networks" for the highest power level in the WWA.
According to the National Electronics Company, the distance from the East to the South is 3324 km.
If conventional technologies were used, more than 15 per cent of electricity would be lost along the way, and the project had been developed through an attack and had significantly increased economic transport distance to over 3,000 km.
At 8: 20 a.m. on the east to the south of the project, it is possible to transport 100 million electricity per hour and to help solve the problem of the elimination of existing new energy.
In accordance with the estimates, electricity will be delivered per year on this line to 600 to 8500 billion dollars, and more than half of it will be available throughout the year.
The Soviet GIL integrated circuit project is a special pressure exchange network with a long-term control project.
If the normal airways are used, two large bridges over 450 metres along the coast will be built and a small, four-footed business island will be built for each.
In this regard, the national telecommunications network has been highly innovative and has developed a high-pressure exchange of GIL electricity technologies through the waterways and has avoided the impact of gold shipping.

New regulations: the need for the right to rural land management for social capital
The need for access to rural land management rights for social capital
" rural land ownership transfer management approach " is open to comment on the proposed regulation of land ownership for social capital transfers, such as business enterprises.
Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture ' s website issued a notice on " rural land ownership transfer management (revised draft request for an opinion) " (hereinafter referred to as " an opinion " ) and increased the regulatory and risk prevention of access to land ownership for social capital transfers, such as business enterprises.
The "opportunity" has now been open to society for comments.
The Ministry of Agriculture stated that, in order to implement the new " rural land contract law " , further consolidate and improve the basic rural operating system, deepen rural land system reform and implement " third-party distribution " system, and amend " rural land contract management approach " and form " opinion papers " .
The Beijing youth journalist was aware of how important it was to amend the "optimal document" published for the first time.
The revised " rural land contract law " has clarified the scope of land flow and has followed the concept of " third-party distribution " , specifically setting " land contract operating rights " and " land management rights " , making a clear distinction between the transfer of land contract operating rights, exchanges and the transfer of land management rights (extinguishment, transfer, unit or other ways).
In this "optimal document", for the purpose of pursuing the " triangularization of the concept of " effective response to " rural land contract law" and taking into account greater differences in the transfer of land ownership and land contract rights, transfer to parties, procedures and regulation etc., this revision has been defined as a means of managing the flow of land ownership, including the transfer of land rights, including leases and units.
The transfer of land contracts ' operating rights would replace other exit management methods.
The Commentary noted that in the context of the "Third Deployment", the unit had only one fixed-term land operating right.
In theory, even if there were insolvency settlement, farmers were at risk of a loss of a fixed-term operating right and therefore provided that the original contractor was not required to return to the contract in court and that there was a conflict with "Insolvency Law".
A priority unit has emerged in practice for the prevention of the risk of loss of farmers and for the first time after renting units and methods of repurchasing.
Taking into account the more mature theoretical examination of the priority unit in company law, it is recommended that it be promoted as a precautionary provision to prevent the risk of loss of unit land.
