A Republican strategy to combat the re-election of Obama
The leadership forces of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat voter abuse.
However, the Brennan Center lasts for a myth by affirming that the polling in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by lightning.
In the United States, the lawmakers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud for 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this respect, these measures undermine partly the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for implementing the elections in individual countries.
In this regard, most American governments have announced new laws which have made it difficult for registration or entry into force since 2009.
Following the November 2010 elections, these phenomena have gained significance, with 675 new Republican representatives registered in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative proposals were introduced only in 2011 which restricted the exercise of electoral law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the voters to provide a light-forming and evidence of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for the preliminary vote to declare the right to register as a elector on the election day, and the right of citizens to vote on a legislative act is challenged.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked the voters to show a light display.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities agreed to extend this practice to other countries.
In the last two years, they have encouraged legislative bodies in 34 states, with which voters are forced to show a light display.
It is important to note that US citizens, unlike Quebec, do not have a universal identification card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a visa issued by a government authority in their country.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an indication.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to receive the required payment.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low income are severely affected.
In fact, 25% of Afro Americans, 15% of people with income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required lighting display.
That's enough.
The students who are considered voters who raise their voices for democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their photocopiers issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same countries allow members of angels or hunting associations to choose stronger for the Republican side to use cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004 no state requested evidence from the state of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to impose such a claim.
Since 2011, thousands of states have passed laws which are required by the voters to demonstrate their citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is in hand that two of three Spanish voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators have been promoted in eight United States laws, which abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters at the 2004 general elections has contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other United States states aimed at shortening the time limit for the preliminary vote.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the former voters were African Americans, although only 13% of the U.S. voters were elected.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
Last year only 11% of the voters made up, but 24% of the citizens they chose in advance.
On the contrary, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters chosen in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several legislative proposals were blocked by the Vetos of the democratic government.
The U.S. Secretary-General has taken action to enforce the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 U.S. laws have been adopted which require the publication of a light-forming method.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right of choice.
The democratic critics reflect the political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the impact of the results in the excluded countries for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have adopted these laws have removed 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral crisis to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the rules on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this respect, these measures undermine partly the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatic cancer diagnosis: should the test be performed or not?
The PSA test shows sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or even negative positive results leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This will lead to increased progress in the implementation of early recognition tests by the already unclosed men.
Whether the test should be performed or not
We have heard the opinion of two experts.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were many disruptive factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference between the mortality of patients with and without prior recognition.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up to 12 years, the probability of metastases formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early diagnosis was performed.
That is why I recommend the test from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old when you have a direct connection that has already been infected with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer disease has been identified.
There are types of cancer that are aggressive and others that are undernourished.
The patient must be made aware of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is decided to be more effective to monitor the disease.
Today, many men with cancer have no treatment whatsoever, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and are offered treatment when disease progresses.
The criteria for a decision on who should be treated and who should not be dealt with are more precisely defined.
I therefore recommend that the test be carried out.
But most importantly, it is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and consequences of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means of preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way of reducing the risk of illness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, a Canadian cancer company's spokesman.
However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer diseases are caused by infection.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer company, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority despite the return of the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," lamented the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after smoking on cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer company, overweight and adipositates also promote the outbreak of disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and breast-feeding.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against grimmon cancer," he adds.
Food
The organisation also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
To a large extent, it increases the risk of developing stomach or stomach cancer.
We should also be rented.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Later can damage the body cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But your studies are not closed at this time.
According to the Canadian cancer company, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another increased.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family abuse.
"The implementation of an early identification test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has taken place in the last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last part of which is predicted that the existence of the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and behaviour of matter - has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicist it's not completely sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a large physical convention in Kyoto this week, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely safe about it.
Despite the fact that it's actually about the Higgs, there seems to be only a small risk of getting drunk, and we look at what's going on.
In this world, there is an inalienable law that makes it impossible for two objects to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to understand this rule - and do not try too hard because you will get tired.
Because even if partial physics is really a very rare world, it appears that it also applies to them a law like this: the Pauli's exclusive principle, which states that two parts cannot have the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quant state", where this "state" exists in the size and sizes of some of their properties.
The physicists directly share the parts into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are known as Fermione and who obey Pauli-Princip.
And in the others, the bosones, a common band of anarchists who are not sacred - in any case not this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosones thrive on the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labores (the rest is absolutely amazing) in two groups: the season we are not treated here and the "force parts", by which the great forces of nature are spread and the Higgs boson is somehow connected.
But it must be stressed here that these bosones are not all such exotic creatures as you could think of.
If you are able to read this Chronic, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "lightpiece", which is the "boat" of the electromagnetic force.
If a part with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "distorted" exactly at this place, in about like a brick stone which has been cast into a roof.
This "disturbation" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and therefore one of the boson "power carrier".
Stableres Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs Field, must be "damaged" in order to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the ruler must achieve very high energy, slightly comparable to a frozen roof, whose surface could only be closed by a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the long Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
Analogia with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to clarify the relationship between the hipgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all parts and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never even be on the refrigerator itself.
And equally do not interact with all parts with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (as well as the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good" now, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science they serve the test of the standard model (SM), and they also enable the physicists to investigate all differences between the observations and the predictions of the PM.
There are still many physicists who hope that such differences will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some gaps in the model.
It must be said that there are still many shortcomings, since there is no explanation for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ups!).
However, such differences have not been found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it did not.
Others: In the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would be triggered by such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the lost physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was found in the 1960s, and in 1962 he developed the first permanent striper (the first to be pulled) - has already said that the laser was regarded earlier than a "laborator" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be derived from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle once again developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras around the world as "eyes" and has brought him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will be forced to change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... ► Le Debor
With her Committee on "Death in Paradise" Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the living.
The debate must be re-entered in a short time, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Debor has tried to take this into account.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégy.
The prostate cancer that poisoned him had left him for two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've spent seven years," he said half-year-old, lying in his home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloei, where he arrived the other day.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a nice dinner, he wishes to resign himself to help with the meal.
He can even laugh and talk to the strangers who are working for him, bring his medications to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my case be preserved as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man panics in the stage," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Home Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable democracies for certain people.
"It depends on the person's ability," he says.
Because, in the eyes of several people working in palliative care, great events take place between these steps.
The patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care of Victor Gandbois are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they will no longer be cared for by doctors and nurses who care for them with the so-called "healing" care.
For women A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by first touch".
But because of the disease, I really knew my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want any more in life," she says, before she accepts that you put up a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she is expecting another last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
At home Victor-Gadbois you offer a group of voluntary body care and assistance when taking food.
The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 residents have a bed for palliative care.
It's very small if you take into account that we're all going to die one day.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the world.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You give the dying person a oral care with Brandy or Pepsi if you like.
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will kick the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We help our members and patients in the same way," said care director Nathalie Savard.
In Home Victor-Gadbois there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his bosses while facing his age, a 36-year-old young man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months three to five beds have always been in bed with cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients assigned to Home Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem with access to palletative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that will reduce the suffering of patients if they have reached the end of their life course, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Home Palliative Care Society in Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
That is exactly what this great shortness of health care Quebecs ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care take care of the adoption of a law governing death assistance and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to announce their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecs is not effective enough to ensure that all the rights to a high-quality palliative care are passed on to death.
Before long, she says, I have seen a patient who had 14 days of severe pain in the emergency without taking steps to alleviate it.
I was afraid that the patients would only want to die because they would not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she gave up a severe chemotherapy.
When I informed my oncologist that I would stop treatment, she replied to me that she was sorry that I gave up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the care staff that this wish has not been fulfilled after their pain has been overcome by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be said clearly that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care of the domestic palliative care company in Montreal, 8% of patients do not talk about pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often take back to the terminal assignment, which goes beyond the patient’s sporadic or permanent intervention until the time of his death.
We can't do it any longer if we don't take this side of suffering.
Patients with no pain relief will be more and more likely to return to this terminal assignment.
Patients whose pain is not healed say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean forceless, "I want you to touch me," but "I want my pain to be eliminated."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a press scholarship from the Canadian Health Research Institute.
Real estate canal large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the road construction agency, company of the construction company, money-creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia report every day what they know about a great "system" that is being spent in the construction industry, officials, politicians, workers and Mafioso.
A "industrial", which was very expensive for the taxpayer Québecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is remarkable how the system has happened since you have taken drastic measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
The scandal was discovered by him in connection with an ongoing investigation of the mergers in relation to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only voluntarily agreed.
The "Duchesnew Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and recruitment of officials.
"From the beginning of the survey in 2010, he stressed that "only the Ministry of Transport would have spent a billion dollars on the contracts," because some paid their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to trial", he adds, in hopes that it will be possible to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 life-threatening permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 life-cycle permanent anti-corruption unit also undertakes great efforts with its troops to investigate, investigate and analyse the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Group", which has since 2009, caused the "canalization cartel" of Montreal to continue with the artificial collapse of the contracts...
In the past few weeks, she has carried out specific house-to-house investigations and has been charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just been returned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of taking bribes again in exchange for public contracts.
The other engineers of the Montreal Road Building, as well as operators of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
Finally, it came up with the Commission clarifying how the "system" works for public procurement.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hands everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also had to organize an illegal media collection for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canal contracts whose costs have been artificially disclosed by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked freely.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as employment payments of $736.000 as compensation for channelling contracts, which he artificially incurred.
Other authorities of the road construction agency have indicated that they have made fun of the fact that they have published the accounts with false additional services artificially about 30-40%.
In addition, Mr Tremblay, an organizer of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, accused him of having taken an honest look at a shadow house that filled his pockets with black money.
As a result of these explanations, Mr Tremblay was back in early November, which destroyed Montreal in a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to win the alarm.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the eastern part of the island, she was opposed to the sale of a community base for $5 million and was reselled for 1.6 million construction workers in the growing real estate market.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
The study, which is finalized, says that it "draws to a father which allows him to understand the functioning of the Amies' underground system in order to stop the mob and start the accused".
She says that the procedure "is painful, but positive".
However, we need only one unit of detection for Montreal, as well as an oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that " Officers stole hundreds of millions of dollars" but above all, he thinks about the role of "mandating drivers who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not developed into fraud!
Speaking of a proportion of 70% black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he says: "We have been told that this is just a weak set of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit the expenditure to $100 parties, which would therefore not change the situation: "unless the electoral costs are strictly limited, black money will be in the process."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going on the basis of courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more control and legislation."
If this story damages the international view of Quebecs and those of Montreal, Mr. Duchessneau asks those who laugh about it to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new size with PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal perspective, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements track me every day to improve my level of play.
And it's even easier for a game.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I don't get excited.
From my beginnings at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clarefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
So they use the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to play very high levels.
They also know that each training unit is exceptional.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the stars and wants to give his best.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti has a lot to do with my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played at the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti shows respect for all technicians.
In League 1, there is no comparable person at present, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with seen associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just received from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top driver.
But we're in the back.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have thus qualified ourselves for the final.
What is the objective of the Union in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything's possible.
However, we will have to share our words with very good European people.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group to be in front of Porto so that we can get back to the end of the game as a home game.
Can the PSG be a major European Union in the short term?
He's already got the budget for...
In order to become a major European Union, Paris has to win title and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG has the means to adopt specific forms of this project.
Was it a big mistake not to win the title in League 1 as this was in the last season of the case?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year is really on our heart to take this title off.
In the last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed that we were strong enough to win.
We've finished the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the great men like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are calling for the title, I believe we have the witness to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that many of us are expected.
We're going to accept it completely.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something you can propose to us, that's certainly frustrating.
You wonder what people still expect.
We could never win every week with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we have proved strong.
Consider Manchester City, a union that has not been created since two seasons to qualify for the end-of-life and has also carried out huge expenditures!
With regard to the sums invested, you believed in the game break with 15 points of origin!
It felt that our opponents and the French masterdom would be left out of hand.
Lyon and Marseilles, who were not good in the last season, were "booted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the funny winner in May and tell us that we have won them in spite of all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To make it better to speak of a "Zlatan independence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is strong and shoots many doors.
That's why he's here and he proves he's the star of League 1.
Everywhere he played, he led his eyes to see that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the mansion we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This stimulates others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French National Mission?
Like a surprise.
It was in my heart to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injuries prevented me from spending some time playing.
I've seen things I've been through.
Today I am able to make good games in the National Army.
This has been my baptism with the "Bleus" hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we must be exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, stands near the players and stands ready to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a game of action in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone used it for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I had never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between participants.
In addition, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is acceptable: the conviction that the current monetary system, which is designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin discovered by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollars, Euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent that allows for direct file exchange.
About 200,000 transactions have already been reported with 15,000 computers on the network.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a contribution or payment.
After the Bitcoin course in June 2011 reached a maximum of $30 (€23), he fell five months later at $2, before he received about $10 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing is particularly impressive in comparison with the world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual money with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "as usual".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to prevent in a video game that can be won or bought by games (and sometimes even exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is always controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all network notes are simultaneously stores of the account book, inspectors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
By contrast, the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymousity.
A number of data relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the processed Bitcoins are available in the account book of the public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to introduce this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task which is started on computers, where the winner, who is a kind of transient central banker, has the privilege of adding these additional lines.
This is about a fragment of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number before it's "excused".
The goal is to find those numbers that give a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can carefully check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unconnected, since they have both different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration will be doubled on a regular basis, probably before the end of 2012.
The current bitcoins are therefore limited to 21 million, but up to one hundred millionth of them can be shared, which makes a certain game room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased by any improvement in the performance.
The network's life has already had heights and depth.
The web pages that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin sites stolen.
"The weakness used does not relate to the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced a paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, Bargeld also shows this deficiency.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse to spend this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "Mega final sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been replaced," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, the Bitcoins converted to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on this money, believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the dealers, and later no new terminals or computer programs must be installed.
You just have to specify a address that can be "photo photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to record where the hierarchical systems are best covered by more horizontally adjusted systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin passes, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, intends to reassess the various risks seen today as high in the case of success of this money.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapai and Surobi).
NATO and the US should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of their territory and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves have been killed by our 88 soldiers, as well as the wounded and injured.
The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries of age and archaic traditions, even if they have joined Dshihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tadshiks.
Tolerant, sometimes supported by local opposition, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discrepancies.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I have seen from a hill planted with mandel trees, which has been financed with French credits, was well achieved.
Kabul has reached the cargo and panzer convois overloaded by Hubschubern without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flows of Taliban in Kabul.
From 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was defeated because of the wars of the various opposition groups.
Your takeover was then considered a sort of release and return to safety.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overrun by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mudschhaddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common wish to keep women in a position of subordination.
The most important personalities of the anti-Swiss war came into force in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by having seized government funds to sell them as a Bauland to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American surrender of subcontracts.
They have appealed, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn't come together from teeth.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of American applications: capital flight is significant.
The young people have set up war and their ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the openness of the parties or to the corruption of certain driving forces will have to make jobs available.
All, including the armed parties, are equipped with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represents a modern world, is being affected everywhere.
There's an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command they are considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Sweet War are already trying to rebuild the militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the case of the Western nations, but by the removal of the office of the Prime Minister, which since the constitution of 1964, the United States has wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong presidency.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid for 50 years.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional pipelines are not available and important water systems have not been repaired.
Everything will be imported; except fruit and vegetables will not be produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that has been subject to war for 30 years, there would be a need for state control of infrastructure.
The report was spread that Afghanistan had huge land prices.
This also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only local to empower them.
No energy to process the iron or copper ferries in front of the site, or no means of transport for exporting over the mountain is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to make their excrements at the huge Buddhist sites and remain the most important workers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and young people, French Institute for the University of France, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was established in 2012, has carried out a number of joint work and measures to improve agriculture in thousands of mountain towns and rural areas and has been made possible by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "encourage heroes and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of cohesion of aid and offensive actions.
These works, which were necessary for the numerous local labour forces, have helped to highlight the rise: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural uses.
What Souvenir do we return to military spending of two billion euros?
A much more efficient budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often very hard in this area of more than 2000 meters.
The message contains thousands of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to be freed from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, would be necessary for the continuation of less, better controlled and direct civil aid to their own interests.
A Constitution With the Breakdown in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is concerned with the declaration of constitutionality which gives it the unlimited power, more than ever, it has decided to put all things on a card.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the state capital had granted this plan two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a provisional, multiple-relative text that weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal transition.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger column of the country.
For his opponent, the President is frustrated in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing "his word" and "the right to meet with feet".
On the part of its sponsor, it is ensured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which the brothers are obliged to postpone to their purpose, explaining the text section for the Egyptians for section.
It is also a way for the Presidents to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest falls throughout the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American Week View Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
Once the people of Egypt are brought back to a unanimous vote, an ultimatum will be put: " Either you agree for my draft or I hold the unlimited power," the latter should, after the adoption of the Constitution, take a decision.
85 Islamic members of this constitutional assembly have adopted the text in a very rare atmosphere yesterday.
The majority of liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November they withdrew, as they felt they were not able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
In order to reach the decision-making capacity, 11 people were added to each other yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally unanimously adopted.
On the other hand, the commentators felt that the only difference of opinion of the day... in the hour for the prayer came to an end, as some members of the committee felt that the pendelum of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text that was adopted yesterday evening is contained in 234 articles.
Article 2, which focused all attention on itself, remains identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Scharia are the main sources of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the creation of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more stringently.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their good will and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals who consider this to be just a propaganda attack.
As a result, they are subject to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in the eyes of the University of Al-Azhar which recognises an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Scharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also compounded by the fact that the next Rector of this university must be far less balanced than the present one.
"There is no concrete religious commitment at this time.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulam, but academics who have been trained in the French system," writes Alexis Bluet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, it argues that in relation to Article 220, there can be a plurality, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious practice.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic Law Speech, Am. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to where civil rights are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised because of the broad powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these comparisons with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's will, the audit of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence board.
There will also be no ban on civilian procedures in military justice, as has been required by the associations to protect human rights.
The latter shall also share their fears with respect to the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The actual file of the flashshield will be maintained, and instructions are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression of opinion, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, heba Morrayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of the folder by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to go out on television last night, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
The sponsors of the Head of State will be marked on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy cities, the Nabel of the world and a sea from the sun
The blessed country combines the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unsurpassed nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Presumptuously Before the Holy Place
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who pray in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the turning of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on water, the squeezing of the sea storm and the fishing.
Right here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the holy ones are in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow the path of suffering or of the cross of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the cemetery on Mount Golgotha, where are the cross, the salvation stone and the tomb of Jesus.
Here is the Christian concept of the needle of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is in the place where a Christian legend arose following the tree from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the petitioners, the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, there are people from different religious directions with desires that then go into fulfillment.
A trip to the height of the company
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the rest of the secret hidden before enemies, which made Herod the Great build for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins out of their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic peak.
In the north of the country from 1600 to 2040 meters, the famous ski area is Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there with a shuttle bus.
The skippers have a total length of 45 kilometers.
An old legend was apparently inhabited by pagan gods on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
In just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
At least five interested parties should be provided with a visit.
One of these is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old cuneiform texts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in caves in the Jewish wilderness, as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of Impressors and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagal and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several souls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures from Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museums nor souvenirlands there.
The income is free, and expenses are generally paid off.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, is one of the most exciting chapters of history.
The most effective department is the memory for children who were built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
In the presence of the room, complete darkness prevails.
The star's working.
And the name of the Jews and the people in which they die is known.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main areas of Israel’s recovery are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and Oceania in each of the three places.
Surprisingly, it is also in the Red Sea in the winter months, since the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air is warm up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there it will be bathed throughout the year.
On the other hand, this extraordinary sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the most deep sea in the world.
Its Turkish blue water has a high salt content and thus does not even bear any problems on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment with saltwaters (natural salts) and salmon as well as treatment of skin disorders, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and extrapatial nerves.
The Secrets of the Age
These secrets are located in the old town of Tel Aviv, which is the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seague, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia enjoyed a close relationship.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and alt Egyptian legends.
Transfers followed Noah built his ark right here, and Persian here saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life here.
Tourists would like to dive through the four gases that are named after signs of stars.
Fortune is supposed to be the legend after all that the walls in the gas touch with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can contact newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can cross through the Roman theater and overcome the fortress of the cross.
In Roman times Caesar was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman statesman Pontius Pilate, including Pontius Pilate.
Tonight evening concerts and operas are held in carefully restored theater.
List of brands for tourists
If you travel to Israel, do not worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of the Israelites speak Russian.
The money in the trip is rather taken in no euro but with dollars that can easily be exchanged in exchange (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast road and in Haifa the only road line of the country with six stations that connect the city with the Upper City.
Exactly taken is a underground railway.
A journey within the city costs 6 cycles regardless of the means of transport, which is quite inclusive for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, every Sabbath in Israel would be held in Israel.
From Friday to Saturday, markets and businesses are closed and public transport is quiet.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and guesthouses, only delicious food is served, which includes meat, sea products, fish without shoes and food, which includes both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with hammock and beef, soup and dessert (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pasta, different soybeans, frozen beets from cooked beans and vegetables (falafals) and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-wrought cats for this, which are pleasant and unsatisfied by the streets.
At night you can even see her sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like live places and don't say no to lecheries.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance also costs $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 cycles per day.
Access cards for museums are available in section 30 chairs.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over Israel visited.
Most adventurers and rescue seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the country, corresponding to a 51% increase in 2010 compared with the comparison period, before the visa obligation was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Save migrants Money for Language
In the course of discussing the benefits of the law on binding language testing for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates
Each year 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families living in the home.
On 1 December, a law shall enter into force, which shall apply to each migrant worker a test which shall demonstrate the knowledge of the Russian language.
Until then, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal economy and in the retail trade.
However, the tests should be carried out in the future according to the Federal Migration Authority for all guests.
This requires not only language tests but also tests in the Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated both for the reception and for the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions shall apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the fall of the UdSSR in 1991.
The sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the examinations will be held under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of National Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can run the tests in all cities; more than 160 appropriate centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the Heads of State and Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press several times asked: What is it all about?
What changes make it necessary to provide language knowledge for both the Russians and the host workers?
In particular, against speakers from the Migration Authority, there is a need to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representative of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelow.
However, your rights must already be protected before their withdrawal.
Only an organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
The problems faced by immigrants were jobless, education, language skills and medical attention.
Sebelow is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will encounter violent people with bad intentions who, under the influence of help, trap him into a dark, whole barracks where he will spend thousands of months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised one, and when you arrive, you will be assigned their passports and won't receive the promised reward," says Tolib Schwaripow, Head of the Directorate-General for Labour Migration of the Czech Migration Authority.
Don't move, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic, who want to earn their money in Russia, say that they do not only control the language of the target country but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not as much their responsibility as it is for the cattle: only a few Turkmen, Usbeken and Tadschiken can provide only a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, tired because they need to buy clothes, shoes and school stuff.
As teenagers, these children also take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's hard without language skills," they say.
"You feel low and low."
Citizens' law highlights the following important aspect of the law.
The test must include only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, so there is no test and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guests continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Excellently welcome" or "Prohibiting access to unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hearings and of course language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly faked and that we are not registered, and then there are cases of pressure.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just don't look at any costs for false papers"
On the day when the law entered into force, it was clear that not only the registration documents of migrants could be counterfeited.
A number of false certificates that have proved the completion of the language test have already been adopted by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake paper was printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get this out of hand: Every migrant who hoped to save the tests was paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than double as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker thirty thousand rubles.
The main direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the evidence cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil law enforcement officials agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they will receive time for a language course for the first time.
In addition, new consumers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of Home Affairs ignores illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in criminal offences is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans a violation of the gun law for private owners.
The authorities are responding to the latest events: injured by shootings at weddings and seven deaths at the foot of the Moscow jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the taking of non-violent weapons in the public and to raise the age for the possession of explosives from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the President of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, and promises that the amendments to the arms law will be submitted in the short term.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to deal with the problems by "increasing the screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published which its author - representatives of various arms unions - requested by the authorities to take away "free threats" from the authorities.
The percentage of offences with registered weapons is very low, except for the criminal justice officer, Vasilij Lesnikow, the Russian BBC service.
According to the Statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 offences were committed using the registered weapons over six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand dealers were registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an infringement of the law on private-weapons' rights will not cease to serve on the black market.
At present you can find any possible weapons for a small amount of money in Moscow, following the constitutions.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the offices
The weapons reached through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, reports former Prime Minister Viktor Baranez, who has been active in the Ministry of Education and General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a web page that takes up the arms command
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the conflict in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are stolen from organized crime shelters.
Baranez explains that these weapons were stolen from both the police's armed camps and directly from the criminal prosecution authorities.
Other illegal arms are sold from military weapons warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a matter of fire-fixing to replace the lack of weapons," says the former military officer.
A contribution to the black market is also provided by the arms manufacturer in accordance with Baranez.
"Today there are countless private ironing factories that do not maintain international competition and therefore destroy the weapons under their control on the black market, about in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the fungus.
Especially many guns and weapons come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes hand-made production as well as a mafia that organizes the harvest," explains the former military officer.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was made by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal literature and public access data on arms portals.
The main part of the illegal weapon is the investigation by the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "debt of those responsible for doing their work with weapons", says the report.
According to research data, 17% of the weapons from conflict areas are derived, 14% go back to food stations in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavation.
A salesperson of a gunload that does not want to be named ensures that weapons found in illegal kidnappings are no longer bought by anyone, since they are old.
As a result, it is more common for dealers to take care of the aftershock in a gun store.
A gun, for example a gun from the TT type, is bought over a knife.
The weapon is fired and passed by the Zaun.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per piece of two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, are aware of all the decisions and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodic checks on dealers through which they offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"How in the luxusload"
Buyers and sellers find each other the most commonly known.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I get to Begowaja station where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I'm looking for there
Military commenter Viktor Baranez
"To take care of a weapon, I need a known person who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a reputation, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there is a need to go there and get involved with a code like "Iwan Ivanovich, who can fix that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even going to get some injuries about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the wounds because he knows I don't smoke him.
Newlings are looking for weapons on different routes.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schematics have not changed since.
He got a photo album in which he was "all possible".
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," recalls the military officer.
The buyer does not get the cat in the bag according to Baranez, but he can try everything.
I buy not only as a potential customer, but driving with the seller in the forest, and we set up a target ship there.
"I can shoot there then, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert explains.
Purchase from Sofa
Internet search engines show search results for web pages and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons "for various purposes" are offered.
There will be no need for any papers or personal meetings.
"They only need the appropriate sum of money," it means in the advertising page "Buying gun or weapon."
There give users your orders up and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", user asks "Iwan".
"Buy a TT. Moscow," asks the Lacony request from "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service at once into the network.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and can swim.
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible shall take into account the orders.
The buyer refers the money to a bank account.
"As an answer he gets a photo and a description of the cover of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the joint organization "Pravo na Oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Victor Baranez points out that you can also go out empty and come back after you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service at once into the network.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and can swim in coal," he says.
A Macarow for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal shell weapons, experts are expected to calculate prices from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na Oryzhie" you can buy a gun from the type Makarow for $100 to 300.
You have to wait up to half a month.
The weapon will be issued in military arsenals by observers of mid-range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of dealers with illegal weapons throughout Russia from January to October 2011 was 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and repression in relation to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers are stranded
Every four American youth in the United States once sitting behind McDonald's box
In the past few days there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in the branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Free Chicken.
Still no one can predict whether the protests will be further shaken or whether they will soon be released again.
The protests are supported by cooperatives and several left-wing joint organizations.
In addition to increasing certain wages from simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing cooperation.
Until then, this sector of the economy has not been organised in cooperation.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where in the US sales, millions of customers were summoned, which led to actions.
On that day, some Walmart staff, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, worked low and extended their work along with cooperatives and left activists branches of the chain whose target group is low and middle-income.
Walmart sells all products, from windshields and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Many of the less paid Walmart employees therefore only buy their own jobs.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics follow that Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheap because employees are paid badly.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing gables or hand scanners.
The participants of the protest at the "Black Friday" asked for increases in wages and expressed their concerns that the contribution for operating health insurance increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour can't afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley argue that if the company increased the average wage by $12 per hour, Walmart would cost $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're paying for now.
If Walmart would fully apply the salary increases to the customers, each sale would cost only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be only $12.39 per year for them compared to today's monthly expenditure.
Walmart's sponsors are pleased to note that only nine U.S. states came to protest and they did not protect the company from any losses.
The Black Friday lasted in its cargo from 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 items per second in this period.
Overall, the Walmart cashiers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of Huffington Post's left-handnessed Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees were downgrading the work and only "a further PR pressure" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free Box!"
The protests continued this week in New York where, however, they did not target Walmart films (which are not wanted and therefore do not exist in this progressive city), but McDonald and other prestigious restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of shares, and yet you don't get a sick day, and you won't pay for your honest work!
Godane Williams, member of the New York City Treaty
The minimum wage is currently at 7.25 dollars per hour according to federal and New Yorker legislation.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage will be raised, but not too strong, and the average earns the hour for their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As far as it's possible to spend so little money in New York, I don't understand.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind McDonald's school, but young people still lived with their parents.
Not one saw the main source of income or plants to stay there longer.
Now I face interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to come out with this pay and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum that its author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if one does not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cook of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 dollars per hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to require the formation of cooperatives in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. Act prohibits the conduct of companies to pursue this objective and to withdraw or withdraw their members.
On the other hand, corporate leadership does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of firm food companies is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were also strong protests on this day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The main point of the protest was a meeting on Wednesday before McDonald's on Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including a member of the city's parliament named Jemane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of shares, and yet you don't get a sick day, and you won't pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, by Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together in order to receive a fair wage and achieve the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people in front of the area who are not all employed in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet seen whether the sound of these protests will be mobilized throughout the mass.
"The brain can only be moderately over-listed"
The theme of the expanded reality that has been popular in modern technologies is recently taken into account by the lens of a special brightness.
At its annual conference, Google first presented a working model at summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also reported a corresponding patent.
However, in a discussion with the leader of the Group on Interactive 3D Technologies in Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the bridge was only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It travels the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with just hands and create virtual space.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
Until then, mankind has remained largely stuck in the phase where it is worked with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also affected.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, which has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional performance systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical world and make it more fascinating.
This is necessary, however, not only for the user but also for its environment.
Then we could find the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these visited virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but won't she be overrated?
- It is certainly not the whole solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their particular nests.
For example, in the area of control of objects on public places, we were working on a project where we experimented with shorts and shorts instead of unloaded ghosts.
In this case, the gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a band that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but it could be theoretically reduced to the size of an armament.
But in general, the future includes mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- Would you like me to give you this sprudel dose?
They say it and point it out at the same time.
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to understand.
- Is that what you want the user to adapt to what a machine can use at any time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which enable us to understand people's reactions more precisely.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, as they offer a good solution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it missing a solution, deep or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of tridimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main issues are not the megapixels itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
This is how all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work to do.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and the Y axis but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too small for tastes.
In our lab in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a regular processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, where today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much it affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work, I needed such an arrangement, only without treatment and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other one is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the object tape.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera signals to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember right, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public in contrast to Google.
Don't you think that in view of the use of technology of expanded reality every day, Brilliant has the best views?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand, but I think the best variant would be a "change" extended reality where we could turn over a cloud from the mirror to the smartphone,
The Brilliant is a personal gadget and there is its strength (privates you can only see), but at the same time also its weakness, because an extended reality prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a long time that the manipulation of virtual clocks in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals available.
There is a problem that often refers to the critic of this idea: there is no emotional reaction!
Your hands aren't smelling anything at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this challenge?
- In my lectures I often talk about the increased reality of the seventh break in the interaction between humans and machines.
I think it could be through the integration of tactical perceptions.
An interesting method is the use of the second hand as something unusual in design.
She's taking great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at providing the "images in the air" with some handholdings, for example, create interference from some ultrasound rays directed at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still as weak as someone dropped over the handballs.
There are also bands for the hand joints that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, and this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to list the brain?
Do you think it sucks what it should smell if it just sees something?
That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically endless space; here we work on concepts with walking bands (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large balls.
Until then, the brain can only be moderately over-listed, and there are many years of work ahead of us.
That is exactly what works in the field of virtual reality for a researcher: In many topics, we stand only at the beginning.
Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to the city inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the list read, there are already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg Art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city's borders and are often recognised in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city is known by Kirill Miller, who is dressed in red, who is often seen at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meetings or on Vernissagens.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are also exposed, they attract large human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of Petersburg's typical social-philosophic artists who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s or the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street his people are amazed by a smile in their faces and cares for them for good wages.
He soon broke down a triangle and became Petersburg's doll player because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his art career, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in the red and not, for example, in yellow or Turkey in the city?
I have chosen the color Red as a fashion designer that contrasts with the optic and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that is different from the glaucoma, aggression, and bad behavior is called into question.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At a exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskij, where my work was performed.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then came the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters at that time, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewskina"; from which came "Puchkinskaja 10", and then it was only once closed.
I'm attracted to the theatre, the fashion, the music, actually everything except literature.
It was important for me to stand at the centre of Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I had a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and until the renovation work, there was a musical and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how snow came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Black and his friends sing simple songs to the back of the game, wear tight tricks and belong to them today's famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it was from its Leningrad.
Trachtenberg modernized many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The "D 137" gallery or "Griboedov" club also have its origin in the art clinic.
Our staff and our tribal guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century, as culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a question in the press about the designation "Personalities of Our City".
I won the "Arts of the Year" category, and I was reached at the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unknown style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring out the reality and strength of the thoughts to express.
I'll have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as Clouds".
Clowns are out of time.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and I'm ready to be.
In a clown, it's all gone and lost its tragedy.
I love the big ones, and I have big ideas.
For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress perfectly.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man the hand, but you should put him in the face.
The switch disappears through the clothes.
We'll see you in the role of the city's triangular player.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice, too?
- Today's commercial art must be careful, considerate and delicious.
We see the fall of cultures.
Earlier, the people formed large groups: the Bohemies loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunitys, and it's hard to get everyone down.
I'm not a hundred dollars note that everybody likes.
Now you have to guess who you're going to be.
Now each cultstar has about 100 fans.
- But thousands of people are coming to St. Michael's event!
- He's got left women there who play a role in the sexual-social sphere.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is going on.
I have attachments, and the most important thing is not to betray them and not destroy access.
In my youth, I have painted such pictures that even in a collector’s work with Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come at the end of the career.
There are often misunderstandings today.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers don't have any culture at all, that's something else.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and spent money to paint.
That's the culture I feared.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Let's be a culture expert.
It is said: The servant of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real markets it was different because the fairs may not understand much of culture, but they realized that the right experts are needed.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have someone who could be the experts, but they are blocked by the way, as there is a need for higher experts who properly evaluate the first ones and free them from the way.
Now it's just your own taste.
The same applies to the Earth, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that they have to search for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; there is much more culture and a suitable neighborhood in Moscow.
On our stones art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural neighborhood because, for example, we have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less for us.
Art has to be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Born in the World
Earth in danger.
Heat heating or combination with Killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with land inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement plan.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can continue to plant ourselves in pregnancy or on the substitute planet?
I don't think there are many options.
The fact is there are only two real planets that we could at least live in hypothetical.
"Nally Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomy Starnberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively viable, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible in large size or on the path of Venus, so in all.
The question of continuing cultivation in all was first addressed by the researchers in relation to the Flora.
Half a century ago experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the seed sown in the Orbit does not differ in the smallest of the earth's species.
It followed the breeding of insects, exactly of mussels (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent to the world to investigate how pregnancy affects embryo development.
It develops a completely normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen has to be kept; it has to be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explained the director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Searchew.
Without solid ground, the kitchen will be overcast.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn were completely eliminated.
The kitchens did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just die.
"Two times we let cook and then put the whole thing in because it's easy to work there with them," says Vladimir Searchew, for a separate experiment with the kitchen in all.
The last fractal with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, there are only same species on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fermented into all.
In principle, there was nothing special about this.
"It was just with the biosatellite, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research had to be continued," said Vladimir Searchew.
After landing, the world's rooms got up.
The problem of continuing cultivation could not be solved directly in the world area.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are cured from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their continuing farming trail.
Unlike animals, man could be the principal.
The Homo sapiens is too abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
However, women have been flying all over the world for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereschkova.
The most valuable thing that mankind has is female organism.
Our mothers flew from it, and no one on earth could answer the following question: Is it going to supersede the universe?
Can they bring a child to the world after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says the spaceway veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her world-wide flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkova, became a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman was born in All, Swetlana Savizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the vehicle, a son.
Still, there is a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy wakes.
"The more dangerous it is itself when flying in the Orbit," concluded Cosmonaut Waller Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a wet state, the cosmonaut Routine wins for work in open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adult water feels comfortable, it is a foreign environment; however, rivers feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtynander would bear witness that life on the island of the ocean is rising.
There is a link between the fact that a child is in the womb of a mother in fruit water for about 9 months and that it can then be used more easily to water.
In principle, it is logical, since from birth to the first swimming just once 2 weeks.
"It's too little time to forget something," says babysitter Marina Aksenowa.
While pregnancy is therefore a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not appear without difficulty.
In the state of severity, the bow and back muscle is very fast back and therefore also takes away the ability to push the child out.
Well, we're dealing with it through breast-feeding.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special room to force the child out.
"But what's going on?" asks the insignificant question of Walleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial force.
Without feeling the earthquake, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in a burden-added position as an adult for training in orbit.
He will simply miss what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we share together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person into the world, a completely inadequate human being," said the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world is only theory.
But at some point it will become reality when the earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break into a distant planet that will be home for their offspring born in all of them.
NKU Head: Black System Control Fails by Debt Policy
In relation to public contracts, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but it has to do with their application.
In the talk for Aktualná.cz says dis der Vice-President des Höchsten Kontolamtes (High Control Office, NKÜ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is not what I think is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be joint control by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative example of practice, he pointed to Prime Minister Petr Nečas 'Black System'.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not harm entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the control board whose duty is to control compliance with the law once in its course," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Court of Auditors, you will talk about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries have been compared with public contracts.
Why was it so special?
This is a parallel test with which we started about two years ago.
Simply stated, it is because the European legislation determines how public contracts are to be maintained, which builds on national legislation, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we were able to determine the most interesting differences. Generally, the laws are perhaps even more "more stringent and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is thus confirmed that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What happens to you from this project?
Only such joint control could help us to stop trying to improve the laws and the reduction and exclusion of thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unfair sectoral or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Maybe it's even so that we only load the system in this way with excessive "paper frame" and those looking for gaps in the system have a much easier use of the system than if the thresholds remain higher.
They are talking about problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Customs Code.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant to the NKU of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us and also has a college, which is only a bit different. However, in principle, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain degree, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these accounting heads in the individual German countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds which correspond to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the regions and communities are under the control of the Heads of State.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would only compare this without specific details. However, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Is it perhaps because the examiners are better there?
This is not determined, but as it has been said: such comparisons I do not like in particular.
It is still important to note that those countries that are a model for us also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise, they had nothing to do with our authority, had they?
As regards the Czech legislation, what meaning would your authority have for the renewal of the grant law, do you already have any effects?
In view of the fact that this novel is only in force for a short time, it does not yet work in our tests.
Since our controls take place at night, we must count here with a certain delay.
As far as we are concerned about future controls in the preparatory phase - we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of the risks of non-economic instability" and examined and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of expressions have been changed, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system subject to additional bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are "stronger" and cannot be respected anymore.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the carrier (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional Council) are subject to the obligation to consider that any non-compliance with the provision of budget discipline is equivalent.
Is it reasonable, then, to make the law even more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not those who have committed a form error which does not affect the real decision-making.
Such a system only places bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let's say which path is not a destination.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not control the businessmen. "Black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system currently banned or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the control board whose duty is now once the rule of law is to impede its operation.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we do as if there were nothing.
The code of conduct contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain procedures - and that is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the supplier is excluded from the best offer only because of form error.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what we lack in my view.
On the streets there is a single ice sheet, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of Chechnya there are partly snow and ice cream.
However, the roads are mostly well-equipped, while increased caution is offered.
Karlsbad
In Karlsbad district, the streets were well-equipped this morning, single-sized snow and ice cream.
The temperatures fall to -5 to -10 °C, which is supposed to be slightly warmer every day.
In the region it is no longer cut, and in the deeper highlands there is only a thin cut.
However, there are about 30 cm snow on the top of the mountain.
According to the district road guard, Nebels had limited vision.
The fast road R6 and the transport routes of the first street class in the region are currently unlimited.
However, attention has been paid, for example, to bridges where the roads are required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third street classes, including the mountain streets, are accessible.
On these roads, however, they remain completely required or driven fasts.
Therefore, in particular in the highest levels, increased attention has been paid.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some East Böhmens roads there is a risk of ice skating, in higher places, and on the mountains lies a well-known snowboard on the streets, sharing the road and road directions on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers in front of ice-creams that may occur in particular in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
In ice cream, it can be made especially on roads of the second and third street classes in the districts Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavi and Vysoké Mýto.
Streets I/43 and I/34 in Svitavi are chemically treated.
Schnee is located especially on the streets in the Riegenggen mountain and in the Orlické hill.
It is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastböhmen today it is mostly sunny or hot, and it remains largely free of defeat.
The temperatures are between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
District Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen district are well-equipped today, but local attention has been paid, and the road has to be adapted to the weather.
This is cool in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has already broken down and the temperatures subsequently fall, it can come to ice cream on the streets.
In addition, it is important to calculate with Nebel, however, where the view is improved in the course of the day.
These data are from the district road masters.
The D5 road is practically unrestrictable, but increased attention is recommended by road masters between 80 and 131 km.
The roads of the first class are too dry, but they are frozen.
In the south of the circle Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can reach ice cream.
The roads of the second and third street classes are weak and therefore the reference here is also applicable to any sections required.
Drivers should be particularly cautious on less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Berzik Olomouc
With Schneematsch today, drivers who are on their way towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district must be counted.
After the use of road vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský Kríž.
Night snow movements forced the road masters to use, according to information from the road administration about 3 cm of snow.
In the other areas of the area, the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"In the circuit of the Shümperk there are still snowiest in the highlands.
On the pass of Červenohorské sedilo, the driver has to calculate Jeseník with Schneematsch," said a staff member of the Čumperk Road Administration today against the ČTK Agency.
Her colleagues in Jeseník district also had to come out at night, according to their data, the streets are free and wet to the high stations after chemical treatment.
In the Olomous circle the roads are unlimitedly legible, but in the Sternberg district, drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, since the roads are still weak here.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In Northböhmen, the road masters report several bad road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice cream, the mountain road from Telnice to Kníce is blocked in the district of Ústí N.K. according to traffic police data.
The temperatures also remain in deep ground below zero, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. From the deep plains, especially southeastern from the middle of the Böhmian Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Eisglatte is reported in particular from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists there were ideal conditions for this in the night - daily rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 along the border of Ústí N.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Kníce was necessary because of axles that were pushed from the fastest to the railway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of the world's transition?
That's one of the disaster reports we'd like to call on people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make ourselves more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to keep the world going or to prevent it.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world transition.
Can you introduce our readers to the project?
It's a country-wide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is predicted by the end of December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts are held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concert should be about the time when the Maya calendar ends in a period of 12 hours.
Who's this idea coming from?
From my point of view, we have developed the idea together with our graphicer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the transition from the world but we also want to think together with the public about the condition in which we once transferred this world to our children.
As a result of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key hangers against the world transition, with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz we can also support people.
The band The Tap Tap tap has also included the same with other interpreters. Hymne against the world transition with the title "World transition falls out".
Today, Hymne is very popular on YouTube. Are they also going to be played at the Beneficiary concerts?
Of course, and even though it's all closed, it's expected that everything will go wrong and the world transition won't happen...
The Hymne should be performed at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the Hymns will be transferred live together in a direct movement from the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you work with both of you?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we perform many charity events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us, and they have enjoyed it.
What is the purpose of the release of the concerts against the world transition?
For the establishment of the Barrier Free Education Centre Studio where we have been working with the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly treated by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to search for the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
Within the framework of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built in which we will then join this project.
A number of groups and actors appear at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to bring together a programme that includes all generations of children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratrapere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May we will meet for the first time at Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting program for this concert with interested guests.
The next year, we would also like to take part in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would like to connect this with events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small until you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group that is composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the storage room. In addition, of course, we need to take along a lot of instruments and other packages...
However, it has always been without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes been partially surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were near, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of how it looks in individual countries with barrier freedom, how it deals with people with disabilities, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we were just in Russia to see that everything is still in its early stages in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not an obstacle. It is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is alone in the city center.
It is not yet clear that a wheelchair driver is provided for, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also groups that are trying to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to stand against the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're going to hang on back...
However, it is still important to note that improving the situation is still dependent on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities also move on their own in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it's not just common that there is a larger group of people with disabilities actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap tap!
Respect for public and barbie freedom is a matter, but only when important sportsmen, artists, players, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will really start to change things.
Until now, these are just individual cases of special desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to create a band?
At that time I began to serve as an administrator at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working intensely with something.
And since I am a musician myself and I have played Saxophone, I have founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, it's like our moderator, Ládía Angelovic, is trying to say something out of control (laugh).
But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I here?
It is agreed that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also begun to be active for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to be seen outside, there is no performance of your own in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funds, we are able to provide us with good readers, high-quality equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I've been thinking about the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the show business today, one often copys the other.
This is logical in its way, since everything new is carefully taken into account and is accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I'm afraid that tap tap is part of it.
The first impression that most viewers have is of course compassionate; it's just natural...
But this mercy is absolutely excessive because people with disabilities are not alone and abandoned beings that we must repent.
There are people who can live and develop a perfect life if they have the means they need.
I always say that if people with disabilities achieve something, this is not only a progress for themselves but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a stricter boss, how do you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and must also require a certain discipline.
But this is totally normal in my opinion.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week samples, they have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm is aroused by many.
But it works everywhere, in every band that works seriously and wants to achieve something.
Today The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these have been from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Ládía Angelovic.
We're an open group. people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the pleasure of co-mating is always welcome to us.
Placed on the day before the predicted world transition, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 2 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three event sites are finally connected by live switch and it explains a common interpretation of the Hymne "World transition falls off" band The Tap Tap tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled educational centre to be established in Prague under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute. Cost: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age, cards are available for sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world room.
Last week, Poland was elected to a ministerial meeting of the members of the EEA World Space Organisation as the twentieth member of this world authority. Poland is therefore the second member of the former East Block (after the Czech Republic became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into the world area began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish spaceships were engaged in space travel, where they did not always understand.
I recall, for example, the speech by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author was thinking of his pioneer work "Engage for Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience cold, and after years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the prize RAP-Hirsch created by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Introduction to Cosmonautics" in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important champion of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis’ internationally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, including that one of the craters was named after him on the ground side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway tricycle was built in Poland for which a rocket operation was planned.
The author of the project and the details of this project remain unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rockets should be used for the start or brake of the drawings.
The information for this is derived only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish childhood began to take place with rocketed geschos.
The research works led the Institute Komörka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is evident from the documents submitted that the research was carried out until the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted free by the introduction of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the specialist press, the design of a photoelectric jackdraket by Ing. Rohozinski grew, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakeetobomba lotnicza" appeared by the author Lelywa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects are covered by the military use of the rocket operation.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Nakuwy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work its work was completed from the start of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space travel company (Polskie Towarijstwo Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in which four extensive articles of space travel are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for a space transport company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that research in the future of the world.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish space company PTA was already trying to contribute to the 1951 International Space Federation, and the PTA was already a regular member in autumn 1956.
The next year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was represented by the International Federation for Space.
He had entered this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA has been involved in the development of the most successful metrologic rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version was built of RM-1A, and started in 1959 in Blüdow-West Flight Tests with the dual-stage RM-2.
The rocket was 1,4 m long and weighing about 11,5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to provide real scientific work - the RM-34 rockets should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor altitudes.
In 1962, however, further development was established.
Following the first rockets of the RM type, the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of these rockets were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ from one another in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Metero-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres of fascination, Metero-1B over 0.34 litres and Metero-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height is 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Metero-2 rockets were developed at the Air Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a 10 kg user load of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth noting the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in the interkosmos programme in the global research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Common Work Act is no solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court has passed the law on joint work.
This Decision called for a lively discussion in public.
It is of particular interest to consider the problem once again from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with free financial speculation.
Because of the great difference in the value of work (loan) it comes at price tensions.
In this sense, it is a condition in which the manufacturer seeks to be established by imports of cheap goods into economic competition by "subsisting" competition in order to increase its market share and increase its profit.
To a large extent, this means that most companies are willing to sell their production abroad or to sell their business at a cost. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and therefore does not bear responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase State expenditure.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and by replacing the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics at this site are excessive.
The unsustainable practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce the social level of their own people artificially and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly evident in amendments to existing laws.
The objective of these measures is to force the people themselves to accept the dictatorship of private capital, in particular in the field of remuneration.
This is due to economic pressure in the long term of unemployment, to the other by breaking up workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as growing differences between poverty and wealth.
In Germany there have been public food subsidies for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work for a few years.
The number of people concerned is already going to millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is regularly due to cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State has to raise its income to the minimum of existence.
A similar scandal has also been discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundesag.
The savings of almost all EU countries will undoubtedly go beyond the same state of affairs in which people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic breakdown of their social level (as it was in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger strike on the part of society, hoping that some time private investment capital will be transferred to the country.
The question here is, of course, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty from one country to another; or capital remains quite the same because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media argue that the State must not share capital in its own economy, and that the economy is leading to economic disasters.
The private capital must be strictly based on its position that the State is not allowed to enter the economy at all.
But then one must ask whether private capital does not influence politics and therefore the whole state in its own selfish sense or even slows down.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby in all countries.
The result is a double situation in the area of corruption, the mutual advantage, a legislative provision, in which it is virtually all criminal, but it is not criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a Ministry of State does not have private finances, close to the industry's legal companies with the development of legislative structures.
These draft laws are subsequently adopted on the Federal Day.
All violence then goes no longer from the people, as it proclaimed the Western Constitutions, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal democracies are currently in a situation as they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompeii: "The state has been in danger for a long time, and the authorities have been busy with violence.
Anti-smoker money, by legal separation of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unabated, and the people went with already purchased votes to vote" ... "People with a character don't steal for officials, so that the state had no consulate for eight months after this decline" ... "You have already begun to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a single government and that a stronger man must be chosen" ... Appian thought that although at Pompius, the strong man was finally Caesar, who replaced democracy by independence.
As it turns out, today's society, as in the Antiques, is based on the unreliable preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
The private capital is no longer able to recognize and implement the benefit of the entire society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who do not strive for deeper reforms.
The causes for the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be looked for in the unprecedented liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In view of today's situation, the transition of this regime can be seen as a break in favour of liberal democracies, where the next round is already mentioned.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today’s elites are the ones who will lose hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnesses to today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know from the past and new history, in total ignorance.
The repeal of the legislation on joint work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to seek further ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore subject to system requirements.
The only solution is political and social reforms aimed at increasing the State's participation in the economy, increasing the influence of citizens on the government and reducing the monopolization of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or could ever occur," sings Sting in song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain says: "...that we may not forget how sinful we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, don't give it," says the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were as always a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide practiced by the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write in this position who is responsible for the death of the innocent and who is the victim in these constantly repeated waves of the killing; however, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the areas of self-government, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It is my concern to open the eyes of the readers behind the scenes to see whom the 95-year-old tension (based on the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small Flecken country in the Middle East is particularly serviced.
My thoughts are partly based on available historical facts, others are driven by these and are driven by my own understanding of who or what group of people are seriously influenced by the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a story of the struggle against power.
In any era we can make an Alexander the great or a Napoleon.
What is less likely is whether it was always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne someone who tied their actions to a specific goal.
We must realize that we are living at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of less individual people and that this concentration of money and its power has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astrologically rich families is a particular one that could be referred to as the head of the Kraken (I don't know whether anyone is still standing over them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
A lot won't be written about it.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has already been bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to connect their name with high-ranking acts, in which they have always strengthened their power, increase their ability or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not participating in the central banks, they lead wars or fight against them (before the fall in Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the fall in Iraq, there were only 5 countries following the storm of Ghaddafis, where in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who has always tried to resist this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, issued his own (state) notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own bank notes and wanted the FED to be released - he was murdered in 1963; Agent Louis McFadden was executed in 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED of the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 1929.
In 1859 - 1871, the global forces of Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan for the destinctification of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freeman of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of consciousness.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchy of Europe, especially the second war to break the colonial rule of the Great Britain, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of such would provide for their conveniences and luxury and would not use as much resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is no longer the premise) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds on the top is the resolution of a crisis and the next offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are always wrong and lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED so that crises such as those that were solved by them in 1907) will not continue.
After they had been killed by the murder of Dronvolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo to release the first world war, they destroyed the Russian Zarenia by the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitalization of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Russia's Zarenia), followed by the resolution of the Central European Great Britain.
In order to facilitate the Second World War, the Banks, through politics, created a slower conflict by undermining Germany with giant war reparations; thereby creating the condition that they would have to subjugate the Germans only a strong enough leader, who called the debtor and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the Czech People's Republic with a strong German minority, which should take over the role of a fifth column and also take action to eliminate the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds began the establishment of the Zionist movement, where a couple sought to establish a Jewish state, possibly in the historical area of Judah with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the condition for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first meeting with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether Hitler was now released from the chain where the international banks had initially held him, or whether he loved everything according to the plan, it is only hard to appreciate that the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps has created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war preparations against Germany for the Second World War, the withdrawal of the State of Israel represents the creation of the third World War.
If it is possible for the international banks to end this war, the Jewish people will be like the Jewish people in World War II to sacrifice in the first battle line, this time with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (only think about how people were divided into allies and enemies of Israel).
Who is the blamer and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice is eliminated only in an endless spiral of violence, where at first the ranks of individuals and their efforts were based on global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international banks in Israel as well as us, the people, except their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism-like, loyal politicians of international banks who are working to eliminate a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could soon expand to a global conflict, which could result in Iran's control of only 2 miles wide streets of Hormus, over 20% of world oil supply.
In what light do the words of David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an overwhelming crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its view, the new world order is a world of Lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financiers.
A world where every newborn is implanted by a chip to subjugate this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give a sign of mercy to their right hand or to their throat that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign of famine, namely the name of the beast or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom! Who has wisdom over the number of the beast?
For it is a human number, and its number is six hundred and sixty."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of Islamic students occupied the US-American message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they requested the release of the upset Shah, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had preserved the patronate over decades of his regime.
For the US Government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the shoe overboard, as this had caused massive damage to the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to implement the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the implementation of a theocracy regime.
It was a serious blow to the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasko in the violent attempt to free the mind was only making things worse.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days after negotiations by the Algerian Government.
The sending of the hostages called for a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian voices at home.
The debakel in Iran contributed significantly to the downgrading of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the United States for a small part.
Immediately before the message was occupied, six messenger staff arrived at the airport.
This ended after a number of complications in the Canadian messenger's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to bring refugees out of Iran; by doing so, they were helped by an extravagance story to cover their true identity - they travel with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who reportedly visited Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the Genres
The expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed a plan that also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to convince the division, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held and the real production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politician, but also a poet. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housewife like the film Ocean's Eleven.
This will change the voting levels in the film - on the one hand, the documentaries from Tehran (in the title case, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there is no great difference in filming the same situations).
On the other hand, the enchanting passes from Hollywood, which are ironic and easily over-extended.
And then there are still scenes from the CIA's central and other institutions - men in drawings at the discussion table, on the office fluids, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable renewal of his career with this film.
From a staged player, he has become a respected director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the Crimea No Children's Games (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Gnade (2001).
At the same time, it's Affleks' first film that doesn't play in the domestic Boston of the director.
The reason for the local atmosphere was the characteristics of the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, shows this inspiration also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are playing on the streets and showing the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the sequence of the beginning of the message is very impressive in its transparency, and yet it highlights the feeling of uncertainty and invisibility that occurs when the story once moves somewhere.
A similar effect has been achieved by Affleck with his team in solid scenes (the false film table on a baser in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to point out that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film.
With the little one, however, he works quite well, where he sometimes helps with the reality - which then does not always work so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis on Teheran Airport is rejected by a telephone in America, or even the persecution on the starting road, make a difference).
The weakness of Argo is its all-wide tension, which is required by necessity, to show too much on action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood staff, but their figures were worth more space, so they are not alone in the film.
Affleks film is losing something to learn. It is a film that can be followed with some interest and benefit from the design and to a thriller from the 70s retro style.
However, it is only a matter of concern.
However, as a reminder of a certain way of living piece of history to this day and as proof of how the ideas of the most powerful and all-knowing secret services are exceeded, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for air balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which raises an annual question about the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Unfortunate regulation or ideas from the EU Agency".
"On this idea, the EU's most recent plan was to introduce a 40% women's quota in the management of large European companies," said Patrick Nacher, who was concerned about the organisation of this survey, against the Právo newspaper.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women is included in the so-called absurdities.
Until then, women have benefited from life insurance because they are objectively at a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher shared.
The conflicting EU regulations include the binding inclusion of bioethanol in substances which are naturally harmful, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small number of these hazardous substances, or the directive on the size of pigmeat due to which it has become substantially expensive in this year.
Critics in the past also rejected the actual ban on the use of the term "butteraurstrich" or also the prohibition of selling for traditional gloves.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose requirements are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (such as now, for example, the Czech Republic tries to implement the requirements of Czech banks with veto drawing).
Lobby's interest was also due to the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and should not show any "crowding anomalies".
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the unilateral national standards which would prevent trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been emphasised against the resistance of some countries to the previous directives.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation last year which, according to air balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age cannot blow up air balloons without the supervision of an adult.
The EU was involved in an American study, which, according to Air Balloons, is the leading cause of early childhood mortality.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market routes.
Kuriose accidents are also home
It is also a rather absurd directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankonnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the association of liberal economies, Laissez Faire, in addition to the absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the Member State.
The EU has thus established the maximum volume of food products that could be found in the area of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
Chechnya then passes over the fixed volume for chicken reserves, for which a high amount of money is threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to ensure that they have no sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for promotional money.
These ideas were not freely derived from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are grateful that we have no sea.
We will be asked to return to the EU," said Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the contractors were very high and the government stocks were filled with intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us EUR 100 million according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission rejected the fact that it had organised an auction on the purchase of land from countries which had no access to the sea.
In particular, funds should be allocated to Brussels by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU).
EU: Foreign regulations are exceptions
While regulations in the Member States are easy to address criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to develop the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition from some experts.
A serious problem is that, in the opinion of these experts, EU funding for projects which have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been strengthened in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call for the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight against the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomouské vartóžky" was defended by the Czech Republic, which restored its tradition to us until the 19th century, however, our producers had to be named "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products of sugar-rolled distillate, not for products of sugar-rolled.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or Parmaschinken also includes Karlsbader Zwiback, Karppen from Pohorèlice and Trêboň, or Saazer Hopen.
The Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Horícer rolls can be broken with an EU brand.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of candidateing for the president's office?
I'm not going to be a senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I would apply anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been pledging for 20 years, how the diet is free, while people are increasing taxes and pensioners.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40 years old, and independent and partial, I have no other chance to influence things than to apply for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you created it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I've been telling me all the time that I'm going to take the fight around the castle after the election.
Later I made this clear and said that I would apply for the office of the President if I was chosen as a senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as people in the neck and front of the television, but that we lower everyone who wants to change something.
To this end come the media who want to rob one of honour and exchange the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was told that I would be a journalist or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the bourgeois borough has taken over 20 million dollars with thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as retroactive declarations of power.
That's what you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate can make legislative proposals as a whole.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used myself to keep the travel manager free of charge, and this could be done.
The problem is the minority policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this will be deliberately rejected and the population will only stop.
As an independent participant, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can do this without having to worry about what is best for our country and what is best for each party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that I see people on the left.
For me, this right-left thought is completely irrelevant.
It's important for me to keep going.
I don't care if anyone's on the left or on the right; I want to connect people.
I publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from KSCHM or ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't care if someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm it by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to do.
You can call this populism on my behalf, but all the suggestions I have discussed are already working in the world or have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of this Parliament, you will only be left with words of defeat.
And that's not how long you've been in politics.
Or do you think it's enough for you if you just talk to people for a long time, for example, to carry out the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other chance.
Politicians, journalists and the public are convinced and tried to put them on our side to implement these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the Presidents of Parliament to live on television to legalize the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and state lawyers.
And then the people who made the promises had to tell you why they rejected it.
A strong personality that points to flaws can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the President's direct choice, which was a public press service.
I'm absolutely clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find links for my views and visions.
With politics I just started and tried to find support for my programme for the majority.
I'm always trying to evaluate things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little bit like Okamura should save the Czechs.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I have not achieved anything by myself; so I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to apply for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jancúra, who was able to work because of overwork.
I have also supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová who discovered the fraud in trade with light oil.
I started my candidature on the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the electoral rights have not yet reached the elections, and those who have passed have chosen most representatives of the institution.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a synod that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct choice of mayors and district officials.
Do you think about setting up a private party?
I have not thought about this yet because I have no time to check the past of every potential member of the party, nor have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZKs.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what do you look like?
I estimate my private assets to approximately CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Scodu Superb, which is about one million. And then I have a few million more on the account.
The Aston Martin was still a child room - James Bond always liked me as he went into the car, was jealous of women, and fought evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a 60 million property and have no money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want your own money to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some accusations?
I've already hid 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program may not generate too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to fight the campaign out of my own resources.
The costs of the campaign are generally covered by my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live alone from the senator's office; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I wouldn't even apply for anything.
So are you still working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this does not depend on the height of the amount.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, in the spring, my agent will be the director of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the same.
As President, however, I would like to set up my own businesses.
The full conversation is found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the head - for example by Spijkenisse and the recently created bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to look at," says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we need another book today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spykentes, a hardly-visible sleeping town in front of the Rotterdam Towers, is a special record holder.
The 80,000 population municipalities show the lowest education rate in the whole Netherlands.
In order to counteract this foolish condition, one decided to contribute to general education a few years ago and to build the seven solid bridges on the euro coins as well as finely defined steel concrete mines.
The success of education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one possibility to become the statistics of the Lord: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectturo MVRDV, master of the customs-cooked barge charts and manufacturer of whitish, yes often sininic buildings, took the matter with normal consent and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under arm and a border in front.
And while the jury was still suspicious of looking and sneezing with the axes, the fresco Maas stood up his reading contribution of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionistly submerged speech with the words: "Love City Community!"
So this is my proposal for the Bicherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of your mountain are protected.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which includes deeper garages, supermarkets, post and a couple of restrictive housing and row houses with 50 apartments.
In early November the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is designated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is why the invisible small town trailers that had to offer up to date were no longer a post-modern walking zone and a fashionless horse-powered race, after which white façades would be willing to rent a coal factory in order to provide a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spiekenis now has the first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
The Long Way to Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under Käseglock.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain mass, but the true space and reading joys end up at the feet of the topography.
The area around the glassed interior is bright and transparent, the fireplaces burned and the elegant sidewalkers speak unmistakably the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at Parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally the book rules stand along the fascade, and there is a large, dark space in the middle, which is most uncomfortable and personal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on the head and pushed the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used: in the center are offices, Internet libraries, Schachclub, Environment Centre and Home Technology Centre.
A special joy are the black book rules, which are sometimes wall clothing, while breastfeeding, sometimes side by side.
Optics, amphitheaters and smells are strange.
Even inflexible architects and construction engineers protect the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Troubost, project leader at the city community Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we have been forced into a freeland farming business one day to a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, we have used a millimetre-done plastic liquid as a welding plant in wet houses and fields.
That's cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's reef for the sperm mill.
For the library, the volume - first in these quantities - was printed to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called farmbuilding plastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogenous, taxable material, which reaches up to Newwagen and up to sports.
After 105 levels, it was reached at the peak.
At the end of the 500-metre walk, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and fig trees.
They provide for atmospheres, especially for the right air temperature in the literature mountains.
Expenses for the new souls
"You wouldn't believe it anymore, but this house is, despite the many glass areas, a preliminary project in puncto Ecology," says Truborst.
It is heated and cooled with warm soil.
Although the Bücherberg is located under a glass tube, the sun itself seems short in sunny days.
The broad wooden alloys that stand on the glassfassade serve as a coating and absorb a large part of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest result in complete automatic rollovers.
Stefan Spermon, the original skipticer from the IT sector, is already waiting for the new bookstore.
It's already been there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the bookenberg as "long-lasting soul".
Reason: For opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to spend a book from his personal file.
This should fill the optical gaps in the complete library - now 70,000 pieces - first.
The concept has gone up.
The rules are filled up to above.
"Nothing is worse than a half of the library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every citizen now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just on the fence.
This is why MVRDV has achieved the king's discipline, which is referred to as an identity institution in the professional jargon.
Spikenisse wrote literature history.
She's so young and she doesn't like it.
This is finally a point of reference for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has voted in favour of the adoption of the vote by Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balanced on a small diplomatic level.
Germany Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signalled that it would agree with the request for a observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin got it.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but not to be critical of Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also included the vote when it went to set up a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to have a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it has just translated its foreign policy and is far from a policy managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
Unfortunately, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore at odds between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still working on their role, but they are on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean, since it is from a German perspective?
It shows the readiness to refer to positions of national interest which are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, which means that exports and relations between certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are at a certain level different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests have an impact on the attitude of the neighboring conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one thing, Germany has large retail markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to put the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not want to take too much weight for him either, which is not a whole single relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German translations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by including itself in important decisions of the vote, perhaps in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic blow, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for this.
Because it indicates that it is taken seriously as an international player and needs to be taken into consideration.
There are various opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the United States has clearly spoken for a Veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama may have some understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so interested in Netanjahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead have to move things out of their own position.
They're just doing this with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role.
Is Germany itself in the role as an important international player - will Germany at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, the various anti-German feelings are free.
That doesn't make Germans easy.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be sensitive to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the US's influence on European policy is continuing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and they still make a lot less popular - c'est la vie!

"Marken protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is also a well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what's Armani Polo?
A name officially entered in China, however, which has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real names don't complain.
And even then it's not clear whether they get the right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection violations in Fernot.
Every week a new case is on my desk.
The following are enough additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
That's how you get from Gucci just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can enter Prada-kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the Puma sport product manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a folder with entry of the brand name in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark of Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world masters in copying and damaging spiritual property.
In large cities there are multiple shopping houses that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch's case, however, is different: In order to his mandate, he contends that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected otherwise.
The Chinese call "Bang Mingpai" a passenger brand.
The word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
That's why women are engaged to rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is harmful business, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The mark is washed away, the seclusion disappears, the damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned will go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive advertising products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China has a volume of EUR 15 billion per year of the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, removals of double entries in the brand register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Until nine years the procedure can be withdrawn, with an unknown exit.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court complained because after the long term of the alleged name has become "Marktreality".
If the complainant has Pech, he must pay the plaintiff even money because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Popular cases also include graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of the factory Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that was remembered at BMW; the dispute was cleared, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against farmers from Hong Kong and Singapore who looked at the famous Crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The brand name CTMO in Beijing indicates that there was a lack of staff and space equipment for 2010.
In the past year, however, "the situation at work has returned to normality".
The file has thus decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81.500 requests for completion are still pending in the office.
It takes a lot of time to get to the opposite end of the day
As often as in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year more than 1.4 million applications for market protection were filed at CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China will take the list of new registrations on a 10-time basis across the world, the authorities share.
This also applies to the record of all valid marks, totalling 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1,8 billion Yuan were charged.
It is simply that each login in section 1280 Yuan or EUR 160 costs.
On the other hand, it is a multiphase, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the groups have fought against a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve its illicit manufacture of imitation parts of motor vehicles.
However, the follower continued to ensure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
It has been forgotten itself because family names cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand name CTMO shows the claim of the Münchner, then back.
In the next two stages, Freudenberg was right, but the opposition continues to fight.
You have to take care of yourself.
Now the matter lies before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and commends the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely exciting and costs us much time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were almost affected by the fact that the company archive must have been through hundreds of years of old to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, launched a "high-six-six-six-euro bill" on the other hand.
"You see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernot are even threatening to return to Europe.
In other words, if imitations are protected there.
Thus a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long been up to the group, although it could distinguish registration.
"You have to be careful," said Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international market rights, rather the aliens should "sign everything which is something of protection even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is under the last act of its trademark, you may have to pay the license fees on the other side for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be forced out of the market in the question segment.
World Day: Stamps, Songs, Help
In Heidelberg the Chor Imbunbui - and in Swaziland are happy to help.
The history of a connection that goes far beyond 8733 kilometers.
First of all is the stamps: Cowboysteifel, basketball ballchose, lady pumps and master climbers are looking for the roof on the park floor, find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voice of the singer slowly fades into the air - old, bass, Tenor and Sopran - strains, shocks and follow.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductors, has almost escaped from his substance abuse when he brings them together with his shameful wild breath.
It is Montagabend, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Impungi is trying a new song.
Fifty-five singers and singers came from the human geneticist to the housemann between 23 and 69 years of age.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir has another text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
There are about 34 million HIV infections worldwide, which is estimated to be unaided, the United Nations AIDS Control Programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS victims live.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS victims in the village of Esitjeni, the United Voices for Africa Paten has been found in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a patent.
She guarantees the child’s tuition, school form and a warm meal every day in the Gogo centre.
Impupui means to Zulu storytellers or also to praise pricers.
The banduts can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, Chor Songers has been practicing this foreign soft language and has brought it back and back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
As 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which is dependent on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple wood and wood huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they're infected with the HI virus.
In Esitjeni it is shown in the small, where all Swaziland is sick: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
cuts in men's prejudices, which clearly reduce the risk of arrest by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than fourteen percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune virus in their lives, with about thirty deaths is not rare.
On a joint African journey in early 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but in particular many children in the Ibujis were on the streets, which were not only cared for by their parents, but only at all: food, clothing, education.
Without a school term there is no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to enable him to have a warm meal every day.
A year later, however, the Chor founded the Association "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally concerned about AIDS vaccines in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI is called Syphilis, Chlamyden and Tripper (Gorrhoö).
Common viral STI are HIV, Human Papillomavirus, Herpes Genital or Hepatitis.
Phyllic acids and creams are part of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and Tripper come especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute notes that at least four of the five cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In Heterosexual adults, Chlamyden infections, Trichomonades, Candidos (pilz), Tripper and Human Pappilomavir are common cases of sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet: around 20 percent of HIV new infections occur in this group.
Among young people, Chlamyden infections are more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human Pappilomavirs are also common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
The number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1697 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been back since 2007.
There were about 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What symptoms show about sex disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, rash, undergrowth pain, as well as blisters or ulcers.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of arrest, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because, in part, patients with sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through skeletal infections and joint physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular studies, especially in frequent exchanges of sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STI and avoid late consequences.
Through patents, donations and not last but the steps that the choir takes throughout Germany, something comes together.
"All of us have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and influential woman, manages money from Germany.
She is also concerned that the wisdoms are well understood, with one of the great myths.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 widows, give them a roof over their head and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms at school every day.
Who has no one else, comes into the shelter of Khanysile, a lonely woman who is paid just like the two kitchens that cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has called for a life-threatening school, built two shelters and organized with the American Health Organization PsI to allow many in the village to have a HIV test.
This is not a self-evident, because the disease is so obvious throughout the country as it is, but it weakens at least the most.
A King With 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sex."
In fact, it is rare in a country where the king is officially married to 14 women.
The last absolute monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excellent lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-banned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the last few decades.
But also the many traveling workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms give it to every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but those are hardly used.
The culture is another - Flesh to Flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imbupi-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of fatigue, fighting spirit, optimism and black self-consciousness, which many know from the time of apartheid on the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of white, singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings praise and joy, but also some proud border soldiers have already encountered a few trains.
The trip will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their children.
Even if you hardly find the small village on land maps, it is more known in the valley of the Ezullo River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," the people said there.
And if you go back to Heidelberg on the 8733 kilometers of airline, to the moving singers in the testroom on the mountain road, you will see it there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the market
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercur.
The ice cover is probably up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercur.
Although it is next to the sun, there is also frozen water, such as three studies published on Thursday in the magazine "Science".
The Sunday Messenger has found evidence that there is a ice cover in the shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that are stuck on the market.
No one brings the fund of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger Sonde, Sean Solomon, said.
The temperature on the mark can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the funds could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life have been achieved in other areas of the solar system.
Unknown to earth's inhabitants are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Small holes in endless distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not "Planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomy Union in 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless stars: The oldest stars are known as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the constellation.
This star-shaped region - by scientists called unRomantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in Cassiopeia's star image, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This distinctive glut of a dying star has taken over the tipper telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-forming ring consists of material that the stars emerged in the process of death.
In the huge Trifid-Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
The Spitzer Telescope of the Nasa took this photo of the galactic birth stage.
The Plejaden Star Station, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the only eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
How a red age looks at the Helix Nebel on this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the Aquarium star image.

One of the largest and worst recordings of Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
After colouring, recordings of spiral galaxies will be made of real works of art.
The recording published by the European South-Easter shows the thousands of light years away from the Trifid Nebel in Star Image Protection.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (trigid, three columns), since dark dust streams divide the glowing heart of the star birth sites.
In the star image, astronomers have photographed the proboscisals of a cosmic carbologe: 400 million light years from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are coming together and are constantly colliding together.
This star birth drew the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not have any technical cuts that may call them the Southern Firecycle at its peak name.
The photo of the World Space Telescope Hubble shows a section of the Irisnebel in the star image of Kepheus.
The 1400 light year Nebel consists of dust körnchens, which are 10 to 100 times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was added from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, adopted the World Space Telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The largest spiral galaxy is called scientists UGC 1810.
In this starboard is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The stars always produce new Youngster.
This star cloud, also associated with the Rosette Nebula, brings back new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers believe that he was created shortly after the Urknall when he was found mainly in the universe.
Our Views in All: The Most Important Telescope
The telescope was to be discovered in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo was used for star observation a year later.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasingly large - and the impressions they provide are always deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Halle Telescope was near San Diego, the world's largest remote power station.
The mirror here in the picture had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is located.
It lets look into All equal to two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Great Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - only the mirror reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Part of the cost-effective construction: The telescope is fixed in its high angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly-Telescope in Texas is also established in the high angle.
Its speciality: the high-lighting force.
This is enough - although relatively low mirror diameter - to those of the world’s largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to all of this after foreign signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by making it available.
Look at the European Stargate Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Spirits.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote power can also illuminate the central infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror shall cover a set of 42 meters - and shall be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
With images, however, it is best to calculate early 2018.
By 2007, the two keck telescopes appeared on the Hawaiian Vulcan Mauna Kea as the world's largest.
They offer two mirrors with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks at them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
On the Mauna Kea there will also be a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here's to understand it on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from the All are provided by the World Space Telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the World Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolated planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest start preparations are documented at the World Space Telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket in all early 2018.
The main surface of the world-wide fraternal telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Orknall.
Scientists agree that there is also a south Pole of the Mercur Eis.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planets.
Radar measurements have meant for decades that there is ice on the market.
Through the Messenger probes launched in 2004 - the first ones that circle around the market - scientists now have a sense of certainty.
Drink Butter daily - and 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A survey in the country where 97 years of age are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A survey in the country where 97 years of age are still relatively young.
The journey through the Italian mountain is to be called wild-romantic.
The small bus runs through the curved streets, across narrow hilly hills, flowing rivers and simple farm houses.
Everything's green and soft, you might think you're in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is the Caucasus population group of the Italians, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very long.
End station is Lerik.
The small towns continue with a very extensive architecture from Soviet times that does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come almost here, too sad is the initiative of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 km, you need eight hours because the road is just one step away.
The said wealth, which the country thanks to its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province.
However, Pilatea Fatuayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the witness to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight thousand talyses from the area, which is over 100 years old. Fatuayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 a child is still seen
However, the disputed star of the museum is the Schaffhirte Şirali Muslimov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man who was 122 years old, Muslim age seems extremely uncertain.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, 1973 he died," explained Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was going to have another daughter.
So Şirali Muslimov has been counting on his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been among the top employees in Central Asia.
"There are also many high-quality people in some areas of China, Japan or Hanza-Tal in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are very many very old men".
However, due to the lack of data, there was no scientific evidence on the age, as long as there was a lack of personal identity records.
Safely sprayed butter every day
In fact, people in the region around Lerich often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many high officials live here in the south?
The Assyrian travel leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Italians.
The director of the museum, Fatulayeva, believes it's on food.
However, that calculates the calorie cost of the Thais to be so healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, milk products and many of them drink a glass-dried butter daily, does not appear to be just pulsible from a scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a blessed settlement near the city of Lerik.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these broads.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 trips, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butterfact which she suddenly climbs up and down.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are oldest.
Two little kids are gonna jump out of here too.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea served in the typical, elaborate Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in ranks and glied, under her head she hides long, dark-brown pockets that include her son proudly before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out to me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly Retirement for Life
She has always eaten only what comes from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, vegetables.
For the rest of my life, I haven't bought food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But everything was better than the "Dear Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the miner.
The propaganda sounds rarely out of the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult that will be moved around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows little limits in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later took over his son Ilham the Ruder.
There is no need under the age of Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (i.e. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as interest, for these conditions a amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has been the longest-born son in history: "The elderly enjoy our culture."
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's no reason, stay as long as possible in life
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising customer commissions in Cairo reveal the deep column of the country.
The future constitution with the Scharia as a basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian president did not share Pathos.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he has achieved, is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian minds, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the sacraments.
Because all of them, as long as they fight hopelessly in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear before a government of God on the Nile of the Blessed of the Mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He said that he was almost sorry to break up the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who wears a doctoral title at the U.S. University of South California really wants to save himself is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear about it.
Whether the action is enabled.
In fact, the 234 articles that were put under pressure by the Islamic-dominated 100-capital constitutional assembly were partially taken into account in a 15-hour parforceritt night.
As in previous constitutions, it is also called in the draft, which is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what's "principles"?
That was and is an explanation and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the weak formulation and the surrounding legal space for a stricter interpretation of the scar.
At least a new article is added: In all matters related to Scharia, Al-Ashar University must be attracted to the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiation power throughout the Sunni Islam.
This must not be done, but it can mean that spirituality is the rule of law, which de facto would have led to the denial of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is the issue of interpretation
Problem: The civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the dictator's death, up to 11,000 civilians were taken to the military station.
The State should also, as it is in the draft, "that true beings of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their moral and values".
This is so legally formulated that state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature using this article.
It doesn't mean anything else than Zensur.
There is no article here that explicitly states the equality between men and women.
Another prohibits the prophet Mohammed and his envoys from taking part in politics or disillusionment.
But what is an insult and how it should be done remains unclear.
Dubios also states that the formulation "human training" has been prohibited.
Is it enough for the president's karikatur or a white one at the expense of a law teacher?
The issue of interpretation, as much as in the draft, the Mursi is present for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution Is Back"
The opposition has been directed against the power of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered at an unusual entry on the Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night and agreed to bring the Charter into force before they could enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential election.
Peace Nobel Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was "on the Müllberg of History".
Through the short news service Twitter, he approached the adager Mursis, who wanted to lead a "Putsch against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and drive him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not healed," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And a number of judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would be unjust.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well-organised Muslim fraternity was on the other side of the show, but not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass bed on the other Nilefer before Cairo University.
Many broken women and supporters of the Salafists participated in it and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's Law."
They asked Mursi: "Purture the land!" and said: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A fight on the height of the symbolic Tahrir Square, at which all its beginnings took place, may have challenged civil war conditions.
The Mursis attachors were obviously not at risk.
The Muslim brothers declared that both the opponents of the Constitution and the sponsors had heard and clearly declared themselves.
Now is the time to let the people decide on what direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of Islamists is considered safe.
"The Word of Human Rights never comes before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is a great deal about this forced constitutional process that would actually have gone down to February and should involve all the social forces.
The 48-year-old Human Rights Act and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were imprisoned or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
For this he was tried, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in the discussion with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to re-sign.
These measures are ecstatic violations of democratic rules of play and lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, President de facto put it out of force," Saeda laments.
However, without civil society organisations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, which takes into account the ideological fight against the Nile with a mixture of novelty and tension.
That could be enough.
A demonstrant on Tahrir warns: "You carry a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the world's most abundant fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on a slightly overfishing?
You're making a choice over cheese varieties.
You place them in the midst of a dirty, wet sport dress.
And leave her there for a week.
This is how you have to imagine the approaching smell of rakfish, one of the great delicious Norwegians.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this hearty smell in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfish is salt-riched forlls, which - depending on how shrinking it would have liked its fish - until one year it will be frozen in water.
When the darkness over the country comes in Norway and the weather cools down, Norway is streaming to a party here in Fagernes, which is now a very exciting speciality.
"But it's cool and then it's raining down with a glass of Aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firehouse, but also organizes the festival as the so-called "Rakfish-General".
In order to avoid this, people use small fishing nets and take a lot of alcohol.
"Maybe people like Aquavit more than rakfish," Havard says.
The spirits can suppress the feeling.
I've been spending some time.
If it is avoided by bringing the rakfish near Nassen, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus trip behind him.
Rakfish is the product of a much different, far worse Norwegian era than there have been no cooling possibilities and fish has been consumed in the grass in aqueous salvage.
In the winter he was then excavated after longer fermentation and undoubtedly consumed with alcohol.
Before one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and mostly traveled to the United States.
Today the population is growing fast - more than 13% are immigrants, trapped by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old Rivalen, which has not been much richer for so long than Norway, flows immigrants.
Rakfish will be considered as something important - as an essential, even though a very rich part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the nicest courts you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norway does not often create world pressure, and most people don't seem to ruin it.
Here you still have to call Anders Brevik on behalf of those racist legal extremists who have been shot 77 men, women and children in the last year.
Instead, it refers only to "the event of 22 July".
Norway finds it hard to accept that someone in its country of peace is capable of such brutal killings.
The growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s is primarily responsible for the current wealth of Norway.
"But oil is not the only reason why it goes so well for us," says Anna, our kellerin, who distributes round tablets with rich rakfish and with her long blue hair and the rising blue eyes correlates the Nordic ideal.
We're a -- as one says -- an alert people.
Her English is just like most people here without makeup.
We're not very attractive, we don't like any paraphernalia.
Norway has been very careful about its oil supply - a large part of industry revenue is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all with money that they did not even have, Norway kept its money budget closed.
"As long as we can travel in Winter Ski and travel in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfish," she adds with unscathed laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - I've had enough of rakfish.
So an Elch citizen is in any case something else.
But at night, the stickfish is back on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log in is one of several event sites that organise a rackfish diver, where the guest can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV switch on to a showmaster dressed in flight, surrounded by tellers with rakfish.
The spectrum is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number of points do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Howard."
You're laughing and laughing.
A man falls out of his chair, possibly overrun by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the harshness of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes his previous challenges and his people's mixed feelings.
At present, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a always forgotten city, but on Monday a call was made from steel, which blocks several important traffic routes into the capital city and provides roads for Chaos.
However, the objective was not to disrupt the way of work but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential pledge and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's in front of a complex task.
Under the different government, Felipe Calderons has managed to keep Mexico economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My Government is very committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week at Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this objective.
Before he went to the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was active as governor of his home state in Mexico.
In this close, far-reaching part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions on the new state capital are shared.
A Direct Man
In the abandoned small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you will like to remember it.
The people of the holiday resort write to him about the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the roads that has been built by Pena Nieto and show a great improvement in the narrow, narrow streets that were once here.
Platelets with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congressman for the Party of Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera says that after 12 years the party is outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The motions for opposition, which the new presidents are missing on substance, will be dismissed.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He's a great statesman, especially if he's also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahuaalcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be larger on the flooded streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden under road traffic and is in many respects a city of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was turned on to combat drug gangs operating in the four quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In one area of Brachland near a large mülldeponie, only in the last two years, the bodies of women who had been murdered were released.
During the official period of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico - a statistics that the city of Ciudad Juarez itself exceeds, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he has not properly addressed the problem of women's murder during his official period.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the four that come down, Irinaa Buddia fights with the trains when she shows me pictures of her lost daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events followed Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family thinks she was killed by her life-threatening.
"When I came home, it seemed as if your body had been washed," recalls Senora Buddia.
There were signs of her being killed, and the body star had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is brought up beside a cross which contains a single word: justice.
But that's exactly what the family said, you've been denied her so far.
The authorities have treated me as a blacksmith, a lawnmower, a Norseman.
They want you to simply accept your judgment and keep your mouth open.
"But this is not possible if there are so many mistakes and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential commitment on Saturday, he will also take a great responsibility for it.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families have been admitted to membership, and the new President has promised to deal with this problem in particular during his official term.
"I hope he's as President as he was governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is why the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza were most afraid.
The government agency claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about mishandling
The government agency argues that Bradley Manning's defenses have been violated in prison.
The hearing is with Mannings time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the complaint on the basis of strict conditions of detention
The release of the U.S. Army is called for the use of thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the government tried to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest confusion of confidential information in US history - failed several times to complain about his alleged military misconduct.
During a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that details of weekly visits by prison officials during mannings during the nine-month prison term in Quantico, Virginia showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross hearing, which was suspended as a result of an application for defence for the refusal of the complaint - if Manning had already been severely punished by the hard prison period - Manning had said he had taken up the Swiss prison.
The U.S. Army Secret Serviceman arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled up after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been subject to increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning said that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a "very professional" as a whole.
The forms, so fine, did not include complaints about mishandling, although officials Manning had questioned directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had spoken to him and agreed to deal with it. However, they had not been protocold.
"They write (after discussion of concerns) "No problems" and that didn't mean necessarily that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The Richterin, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met a committee that should investigate suicide thoughts mentioned by him several months ago.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to leave his observation status to "prevent damages".
The military said it had given him this restrictive status - one level under the threat of suicide - to his own and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince my employees that I was doing well, and I lost the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been arrested and detained in Kuwait, where he was arrested for nearly two months before he was transferred to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he had considered suicide and was once unconscious because of the heat.
I don't know what happened to him or to the outside world.
"My world broke down on Camp Arafjon, on this couch together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his day in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a matrice, a blanket, flip flops, dress and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just add.
He must have slept with light, which penetrated his cell from outside.
If he had turned around at night and could not see his face anymore, he had been resurrected so that he could return.
In January 2011, Mannings Anwalt formally filed a complaint against the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Richerin Manning also questioned a charge he had made on Thursday - so he had to sleep in his cell in Quantico for a night and have to stand in front of the guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity during this number to surround himself with his cover.
On Friday, Manning started asking, he concluded from a command of his guard that he should let down the blanket he could cover himself with. However, he said that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had said that he had been forced to sleep the night before. He had tried to show an officer that he did not pose a danger for himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the band of his underhose or his Flip-Flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
On this night, Manning said that his underhose, Flip-Flops and Brilley were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his case-laws and that his case-laws will be severely reduced, he should be judged before the military court in his trial. This is for the beginning of next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be known to be less guilty, while other complaints that are considered to be too extreme should be filed.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. Public administration is expected to legalize the terms of the proceedings.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners in Quantico who are under the highest security conditions.
The charges against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all charges, he will be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame foreigners - they call them hard times in memory, he says.
Navarret is the view that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass control when there was widespread intolerance in me.
Pictures refer to two waiting columns: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico"), one for "Extrajeros" ("foreigner").
I've been there for a few seconds, I'm not sure what I should know about.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life has been called "Mexico."
A ethnic circle - just like my friends in Boston called "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided for "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for bullets or chains.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at the end of a interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and I won't let my American accent go either.
So I took my American travel passport and put me in the shoes for abroad.
I was thinking about a moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans today to stay in Mexico with the same high probability instead of moving to the United States.
He wanted to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swears to continue the war against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of feelings.
Most Americans have probably never lost a single thought that in 1848 the United States entered Mexico and forced the country to leave more than half its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, reminders of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a US government official is using only the mildest criticism of Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country - complaints about how Americans burden the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the way to war.
However, Mexico is the biggest challenge in reality with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Love to talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People who offer opportunities for the country and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - has not been offered a chance in Mexico and fled north.
And in most cases this person met a profile - dark, untrained, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust belongs to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we can never lose sight of the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes weakened as possible, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on the opposite.
They see us as the smell of a moving landing and look at us high because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Your opinion that our existence is a symbol of the shadow.
If our families hadn't been separated in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves now behind the wall - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow we lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexicans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this crap.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they will not belong to any other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you're not upset about it.
In Mexico we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States we'll be seen as Mexicans.
As I should have learned during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican drivers and parts of the education community want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "messenger" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great this country's visit is and press on political leadership to intensify its links to Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
To many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, unencumbered corruption and drug addiction, many of us are not so sure if it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go by yourself, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico over a quarter of a century ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are going to bear a burden on how their family members were treated just recently.
Hmm.
Maybe we're "mechanical" as I thought.
Old-fashioned, New Near East
The arms situation between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected fundamental pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The most recent blood-threatening events seem to inspire such hope in the body.
Among the usual school instructions were free buildings in protection and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were attacked near the Israeli Metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Although Israel and the Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, unknown situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of it.
Maybe this will only lead to more blood loss.
However, there are reasons to believe that the fatal condition could finally find its end.
A war that will not be lost or won
At first glance optimism seems to have taken place in view of the current situation.
Even if the arms situation agreed on 21 November, this week's fight has strengthened the heartsets on both sides.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will be claimed to have forced Israel back, although his group had to record very large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being forced into one of the most desolatest and most popular corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas so far.
In fact, Hamas has gained added to the West Jordan, which is controlled by the rival, balanced Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have won influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a renewed regional power, which became Israel's first Muslim allies, has reached the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf.
Jubeld Hamas supporters believe that Israel constitutes an Islamic Halfmond - from Lebanon in the north, where the military Hisbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebellions of an increasing Islamic persecution could arise before the defeat of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas allies drive the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim fraternity under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the largest and most important Arab country in the south of Israel - has consistently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laoist Despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall in 2011, had only a little time left for the Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor which could not be forced out by Israel itself and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, however, let a opposite conclusion be drawn.
Militaryly seen, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli rocket reconnaissance system, "Iron Dome", has been able to save itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a very long time Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
In a diplomatic sense, the United States has taken a stand against the United States. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has achieved well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process for a large part.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide attacks - not least thanks to the sprerannages that have taken place in the West Bank and thus in the main part of a Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared against national law, but are still being built.
Netanyahu is good there. His Likud party has joined Avigdor Lieberman in the front of the elections on 22 January.
Why do these behind Palestinians also fear and abandon their own state?
If they really had control over the West Jordan, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their own fire fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should drive them to make heads.
The hardliners may be able to pass through, but the Arab Spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Muslims who now sit in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defence system is larger than its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments in their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama to achieve a state of arms could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolic the beginning of a new era.
Israel should also think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to build their own right to self-determination - a powder phase that will undoubtedly be exploited one day in Israel's occupied areas, just as a bus in Tel Aviv took place this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only intensify.
Blood missions to force Hamas back into the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic trip over the years.
Both sides need an outside touch
The correct answer is those represented by the wisest representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel stands for security purposes.
The - for the near future - is the hope that the state of arms will have more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Egypt now has to stop arms delivery in the Gaza Strip together with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever before in order to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by a regional exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah into an agreement.
This would make more possible for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the previous application for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he ignored the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away from the white house it seems as if he would have stopped participating as well.
But this is a sad, short-term perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform packs of cigarettes
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The first laws for uniform cigarettes and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia. Markenlogos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive green blankets, which are also printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and cigarettes and children affected by cigarette smoking.
From the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names that are printed in identical small letters is the next Saturday.
Australia therefore introduces the most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies shows that people who have not started with 26 will no longer smoke with 99% of their probability.
"You can already see in children young adults that they understand the message to try to hire tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. You are quoted studies that have shown for example that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
While Australia is one of the world's smallest smoking quotas and changes will only have a small impact on the benefits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought against the laws.
Thus, legislation would benefit black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian falsifiers are offering a wide range of these products on the Australian streets.
Others say that the laws have corrupted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette Internet and silicon detectors for the detection of illegal packaging has been enormous since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco broke up at the Supreme Australian Court two months ago with their enforcement of the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale business and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
Experts are therefore in favour of the social media in the area of the specific population group to which the plan is headed.
A number of Australian laws have ordered tobacco companies from TV advertising to refuse to appear as sports sponsors and force most traders to quit smoking in business. The tobacco competition has now been changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and websites, but has no impact on international sites.
"He who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to sell his products, doesn't come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has identified an increase in experience reports on brands, which were created by "gaz normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is it just a private person who finds so many cases of Marlboro cigarettes that she even has a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that industry is focusing on marketing in order to align itself with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to implement the new regulations - those countries are complaining about unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organization, although no country is dealing with Australia's largest trade.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
Plibersek has subsequently conducted talks with other countries considering the relevant packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to sign the photo alerts in 2001.
Meanwhile, these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are being passed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of Australian smokers are still showing up.
The images don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"It's just a kippe and it's going away," says Victor El Hage when he buys a cigarette bottle on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in Sydney's inner city, says that the unit packaging has made it difficult to fulfill its rules.
"I used to need an hour ago to sort out a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply have prohibited cigarettes - then we would have told us okay, that's what we're doing," he adds apparently.
In a constantly electrified world it's nice to be even longer
I spent five hours at the airport this thank you when our plane fell out because of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flighter.
So I had enough time to make a couple of long-distance thoughts.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course free of charge shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts point to long distances as something positive.
If it goes after them, it's for us - and our children - okay, it's to be temporarily delayed.
In this way the brain will be forced to lose itself in interesting reflections, which may contribute to creativity.
And since most of us today almost always starve on one screen or another, the benefits of long distances no longer come to us.
So should we welcome the long road with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be right back.
Like many people I've always learned that long distances are a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increased freedom.
However, Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Level History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"In fact, the long distances have a very long history," he says.
The house wall Pompejis draws a Latin graphiti on long roads, which goes back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we really define long distances.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, is therefore concerned that long distances have been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that long distances as the experience of wanting to carry out a satisfying activity, but this cannot be defined.
Long-term differences vary from Apathie to that the person is not employed, but wants to be.
However, there is no need to do anything at the Apethie.
The key experience of the lengthway, he says, exists in a "disturbation of the attention process, accompanied by bad noise and the feeling that time just goes away".
Long distances can be almost as stressful as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, people with disabilities see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that it is long-term, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate on.
In her study "The Uninterrupted Mind: Defining Board in Terms of Attention" - in Germany about "The inconceivable sense: The definition of lengthways under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment to which the participant had heard a band on which a person had submitted a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the nearby room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not take this noise at all.
The people who took the almost accessible television offered to delay longer distances than the two other groups - they had problems, concentrate, couldn't find any reason for this and write their difficulties on long distances.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or demanding task, the distraction of attention can lead to long distances, says Mark J. Fenske, Associated Professor of neuroscientistry at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you have a unique activity - "such as looking for wrong products on a factory forwarding band, music can slow down and help you not feel better".
In fact, he says, we now know that crossword puzzles and crystals, often interpreted as signs for long distances, can even fight them by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are able to stay home can learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will once again be long-lasting - my late flight, a moving voice speaker, a particularly encouraging film.
But some people slow down more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of long-term vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to become girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University - in particular with regard to the need for more and a greater variety of foreign travel.
But in general teenagers are a rather relaxed house.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment by which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults in the school and at the end of the household chores had been delayed, although 23% had been admitted if they were not in the school.
However, only 3% of the parents agreed to feel long-lasting.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages of long distances have increased or decreased.
However, he was sure that "the young man will be particularly long", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily life.
So back to my original question: Is Longway Health?
Sometimes not because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into the gambling game or drugs to slow them down – studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between longevity and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With the long distance the brain wants to say something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If one is slow and you use this energy to play guitars and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can provide short-term security for happiness, but these refugees are long-term but once again.
So whoever has an iPad for his adopted child can take it off the long road. However, it has not learned to maintain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: " Self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to control himself but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate long distances.
We should not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to benefit ourselves from ongoing activity and technological innovation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we had to be more patient, but long distances are the cool, unfading desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for one way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to work if the noise is upset once."
In Colorado there is no clear guidelines for the new Marihuanagese
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco is in South Colorado for a trial before a court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few little Marihuanabrocks and a pipe he smoked with.
Orozco followed him and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer Marihuana found himself in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drugs - quail dealers, each with a fine of $100 - and received a court term.
"We'll be treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of Marihuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drugs is less than the law.
Hundreds of irregularities affecting Marihuana are already being dealt with here and in Washington State, where similar measures have been approved.
The police authorities are no longer monitoring adults over 21 years of age for possession in a small way. This is legally allowed as soon as new laws enter into force in the following weeks.
But state lawyers in the more conservative areas of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing Marihuanadelicities and still call people before the Court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed Marihuana business in their communities from the city of Denver to the Western Mountains.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, who is east of Denver.
And the regulatory authorities in Washington, U.S.A. are on their way to the head.
They are waiting for a guidance aid to establish a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case predominate in most countries as regards the regulation of Marihuana. There the drug was legalized only for medical purposes and then for its own consumption.
"Colodo has a stronger regulated market. Therefore, the state deserves a good orientation," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the supervisory authority for spiritists in Washington State.
But Smith also suggests that no place or system can do more than serve a grave guide.
"We don't have any real precedent we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, is in force on 6 December and thus forms the end point of a grauzone, in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unacceptable practice questions must be clarified at this time - such as how the state standard of "appropriate access" to Marihuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis business around 300 metres for schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
" Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his staff to Aurora an e-mail in which he stated that the state attorney would no longer pursue minor marijuana incidents in persons over 21 years of age and that the police would not "be immediately" attempt to punish these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban standards to regulate the construction of medical marijuana and continue to be followed by drug dealers.
In the World County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck is represented by a district official.
Following the vote, he indicated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers away.
At present, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of Marihuana before the court, although many have also been charged with other debts.
"Our authority has the obligation to pursue infringements in which it has been dealt with at the time of the offence," Buck wrote in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country crisis, are no longer showing adults to own smaller quantities.
The district government official Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to allow all outstanding property procedures to fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time exercising the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to agree with the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexity of government and the legal system.
And the negative reactions throughout the country promoted a deep doubt among local officials about the great green experiment in days.
In the case of district attorneys, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is represented in the case of Marihuanadelicts in court and acts as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of Marihuanages.
"They have spent such a large part of their life in order to punish persons for not yet able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries dealing with smaller amounts of Marihuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national samples for the legalization of drugs.
While public speakers and state officials were preparing for an age of legal sales, they were also looking forward to instructions from the federal government that would continue to treat the sale and construction of Marihuana on federal level as a punishment.
Speakers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be monitored.
Despite several outstanding arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama government, is of the view that although criminal officials are likely not to enter into any door to deal with smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be tempted to wait for legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new Marihuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, probably next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level before a big problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Treaty.
Our Community has voted against this legislative amendment.
We look at what the Community has decided for and not what the state has decided for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was moved from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for their views
It's always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited those universities, which I considered to be the world's largest scientific stamp, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had had to study history - I had repacked my suitcase and thus re-entered the first scandal of my life.
My father went into trains together.
My friends were confused.
At Evening Standard, I would have gone because I had a problem with having comlitons in the nearby room sex.
Author A N Wilson declared it rude that I had left the university because I was forced to drink contaminated bags.
But the truth was less amusing.
I love it.
Yeah, honey, because I'm under systematic motion and smoke.
Not because of my real unusual names, or because I came from a private school.
It was only for one reason that I had been schizophrenia - a reason that in these alleged ways the lighting seemed so tighter and more graceful: my dying father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I was a sponsor of the Conservative Party.
Why did I mention this right now?
Now, the current reports lead to a new generation of students under similar persecution.
The organised and growing hate of Tory students in Oxford has gradually developed such dimensions that a group of them last week requested the same equal rights protection, the schools, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College are "often isolated, personally attacked and declared unwilling" because of their political views.
They require a place in the Committee of Equal Rights of their college to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was deteriorated by a recent detailed documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which was presented to the Touries as excentriquers and neonaissors.
Among other things, Absolent Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, continued in a Rolls-Royce with silver-coloured approach and silver-worked gohstock.
Conservative students at other universities say that they are considered "Sin books for the introduction of higher education fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Union of Nottingham University, was quoted in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing linkage in universities.
People believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club without ever knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and History student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unfriendly". Nineteen-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she has observed a growing trend in JCR members against students of the right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredible 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The Hass on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year the university had agreed to grant Margaret Thatcher - an earlier student - no honor due to cuts in college.
The atmosphere would even have caused Stalinists to panic.
On the first day of the first semester, when the new students and the tutors met, I received a preview of the future events.
I learned that the tutors did not only tolerate the abuse of Tory students but even shared in it with joy.
Political issues such as the mountain range, privatization and denial of sanctions by the Government against the apartheid regime South Africa found their way into the forested areas of the Tutorium.
I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English for my first time.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt, "Please translate the first paragraph."
I'm proud of it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like kitchenette, and quite friendly.
"Are you going to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were watching.
In my eyes, tears rolled up.
"I suggest they take a few hours in your time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt told me.
I went back to my room with a hanging head.
That night I went to college alone at dinner when I was slightly tapped on the shoulder.
He was an English student from the second year named James, who was represented as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
I'm sorry. It's what it is.
Anyone who's suspected of being Tory will be forced to leave.
It's bad enough for me already, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is approaching, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most of the first Tory teachers suggest being a member of the lab party.
In a local pub, I later tried to convince myself.
I was aware that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of the opinion.
This trick should prove successful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economy who had visited Eton College as a conservative ironic, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist Swedish."
You're tired.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was mean and drunk.
"How's Tories Sex?" asked one of them.
They fight each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the United States' liberality.
Would I be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet the same feelings only after the dark?
Should I use the lab party and suppress my natural denials?
The three years that were ahead of me turned into a fire of care and isolation before my spiritual eyes.
The only tutor to be known as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was not only inclined to be a conservative but also because he had consulted Thatcher in foreign policy and had written for her.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and minorly and left him behind for his Marxist-Determinist history perspective.
In 1997, he attended a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to walk between Oxford and the home of my parents and found refuge in closed friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredible.
All political views were accepted during his time in the quarter.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in a small voice.
They'd never do anything like that in my city of dreaming turms.
Even my Communist friends always put their hands on the day.
His tired eyes turned around.
Give the whole guy a chance.
I'm sure you're not alone.
It would break my heart if you went.
Created by my frequent journey to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my men's friends, as well as Tory's supporters, had followed the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a tour next week, where another historian had seriously claimed that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was hiding in front of shame, I insisted that my parents had taken me under a "grain washing", and they called me "old trottel".
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who beat the last needle in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Mordoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and five minutes later my hats came up.
When they left, I picked up a case and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a wine breaker.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such neglect and boredom in a education institution.
And it's even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hiding behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino promotes elegance of fame"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashionmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital to hold an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothing of the Haute Couture were assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his irrefutable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signor" Garavani, which could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always been fascinated by fascination for the narrow and remote world of the Adele.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most learned aristocratic, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise from the determined fashionmaker in Voghera City in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
He's in love with the Adel, he doesn't have to be of a draw.
"At least they don't show their hips on your magnificent carpet, as it does some beautiful features of pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, large and elegant guest.
"We are all glad that we were invited to his house in Gstad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is well acquainted with forgotten beauty, such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always ignored the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress from Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charm of the fashioner.
Many years ago we went to him after a fashion show at Piazza di Spain in Rome for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he recognized his influence.
"All candidates felt important and loved," recalls the "Top model", which began their career in Paris during the week of Haute Couture 1995.
"He never comes from fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Modern view of the source
The life of Garavani is not a story of weakness, rather than of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre walk that suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the track to admire a dreamful "audience" that carries the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this publication, name names such as Sibila de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thorn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgetably".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a hose, a hemd, a western type "Gillette" and a jack from the Herbst/Winter Collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museum of the designer.
"I draw him all others because of his great love for women and because he prefers our beauty," adds the ex-herzogin of Ferria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and head of opinion at the mode Patricia della Giompaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she took a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to an end.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the close of my vetter, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a painted masterpiece with a decollette that makes his name honored.
"It was a real dream," said the Whiteman of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his property is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dress from the fashioner "with absolute care," "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories".
The "King" of the mode
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragaszze" (as the fashioner called his neighbors) were necessary to prepare this elegant silk dress with pearls, twelve different stitches and a four-and-a-half-metre long sweat.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the superior authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the superior society".
For years with the "savour-étre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest appointment of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, distinguished with the honour religion, Garavani cumulates as many honor as any of its customers.
"I've always felt his refinement, his peace, his carefree and perfect outside," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the museum de Orsay.
He's on the table at the graveyard of Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was free; the time left no trace of him."
And that says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working flock of Kawah Ijen
For four Euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano are putting their lives and their health at stake when they carry 70 kilo sweaters over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people whose work is for hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by getting their shoes from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down the floor of his crater every day, where the exhaust gas from the earth is absorbed in contact with the air.
After breaking out large snowflakes, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them in two bambooscars on his shoulders over the desolate path from stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which reaches a height of 2386 meters, but the created carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the screen time, where they have to keep the balance and carefully set their steps so that they do not drift and shrink.
You know that every step of your life can cost you how this happened to a French tourist who spent years in the streets of Kawah Ijen.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each Kilo sweater they're leaving.
Up above, they walk the road between tourists who take pictures of them as circus bags and walk with the encouraging heavy bodies three kilometers to the wall, which has set a small minority company down at a height of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrinbi, which has been using the Vulkan events since 1960 and (not to be said better) its workers who pay 662 Indonesian rubies (5 Eurocent) for each Kilo Swefel.
It is then sold for each 10,000 rubies (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widely distributed every day and is used for the production of coal, fire products, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugarcane.
"When we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rubies (3.8 euros) for each road," explains Anto, who makes three trips a day in the usual case.
For each route it takes three hours, where it has been fully created, but at the end of the day it has a total of 138 000 rubies (EUR 11.5).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a massive inhuman effort is the trifle of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of the mine workers here, where 15000 rubies (1,2 euros) are paid per day and the average monthly income is two million rubies (167 euros), is very high," explained the driver who worked as a wall on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rubies (EUR 6.2) a day, and the work was not as hard as it was, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village near, and for one reason which is as important as the Swede in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert them to Islam."
Asthma, who has suffered from difficulty, has often coughed his eyes because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has spent three years his life in the Kawah Ijen, whose shoes have already left him the first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Asthma, with difficulty, has often coughed and her eyes are driven out of the volcano because of the toxic gas.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'll work here for two more years because I want to open up a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just comfortable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but experienced young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a conveyor belt.
He shares a dirty wooden cloth with other wearers and stands up every morning at two o'clock because the sweater also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the dark.
The shadow challenges him in the light of a small star lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
About 400 wearers are loaded on the crater floor with shoes on their shoulders.
Despite its great profit, the minority company has not been able to mechanism the ski lift to save costs and delivers no equipment to the carriers working on their own account and paying for weight.
They also do not receive any share of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) supplement per photo equipment that the guards of this natural park, together with the income amount of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) require from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," Madrusin, a famous 42-year-old wearer, who has been working for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues to "salage it" because he needs the money for raising his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the swab burns the keel and tears the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns around and the miners climb out of the thick hills, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course except the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have formed themselves from the weight of the body.
With the basket on its back, Unianik, with its 53 years of age, is able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his men break 15 tons of dirt from the volcano that is transported by three LKWs through a narrow path between the bridge to the warehouse in Tamanzari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unaninik, where he opens his mouth wide, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a shoemaker with his 30-year-old.
Time goes by, but poverty keeps generation on generation in one of the most difficult professions in the world: those who work as human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans charge that they have no children, on careers, stress and the costs of property and child training.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotist husband, you're my patriotist wife: We're fulfilling our civil obligation and we're creating lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a commercial for Minzbonbons, but yet - or just because - they started this year in Singapore to be a viral video on YouTube.
The sets are part of a rapper song, the local languages such as "Schieben will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make himself fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising company, which has driven the video, has the hope that advertising can be achieved in a funny way and in a way to focus on the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people into line with their "national obligation".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and witty.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In continuing plants we are the worst in the world, so we noted that it is a matter of concern to us.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating evenings.
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, such as creating a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Each year it provides $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for couples and parents is provided up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything was so far less successful.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city in Southeast Asia that is also known for the conservationism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was less than 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans get children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National People's Authority, says that this is to return to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have more options with regard to life goals than marriage and to form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of unmarried people and to the increase in marriage and births, resulting in the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migrations in order to prevent the reduction of the population led to feelings among the local people.
In Singapore, there are websites where almost hidden Xenophobies thrive against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore has achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and duties for foreign workers.
Unexpected Tracks
While the decline birth rates have the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not many small apartments are built.
It already has effects on the housing market.
The city development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "scatters" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life-style of the lonely and that they break down the construction companies to build a large apartment for families.
But Lim You Son, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "snakes" are much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold every day and even weeks faster than the largest housing units.
This means they're much better for our Cash Flow.
However, it is necessary that the new standards give the developers clear guidance that had previously been put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way for an increase in national birth rates, the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial sector are to realize that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and the training are expensive, why it is being thrown out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get other.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and costs for property and training as a reason that they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - there is still much the government can do.
The offline private offline is online private
Private Area
According to the dictionary, it is a private or "new area of privacy where protection is required from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the risks he poses when he makes himself known on Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often online.
In four of the cases, they linked the concept with "something very personal" at personal level and "on the password and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be known in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "privat" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has been available for two years over accounts.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother must know, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games high.
I also spend my time with strangers.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't from me or someone who makes the drum head."
The young man is aware that it is wrong to write beautiful photos of boys, to publish crimes, or to write misleading or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are related.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I called on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just loading her up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to people connected on the phone or with friends," he says.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone suggested to him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he does not know 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
After the boy was given no instructions or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone bothers me or wants me, I just remove him from my user account" he says.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experience is unknown, which today is known as cyberblulling.
A friend's name was printed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never experienced who it was," he says.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then it explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of famous people in uncomfortable or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to eliminate him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a university degree degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orientation children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium to search for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of play have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master title at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The digital Natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who should teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject "because we want them to have a defined criterion on what they have to disseminate, publish or say, and this in an age where the reputation is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be loved to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way and way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
"Tell them they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras next mentions some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it happen to you if you published a photo of you, like what you published by a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission if you have taken photos of holidays?
And another question: Do everyone need to know what you're doing at any point?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to deal online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet deals with respect, stability and other principles, and must also apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Esturado Guardia, Professor of University, Primary Schools and Educative Consultants, comments that it is impossible for parents to read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardian, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven existing rulers.
Efe tried again to obtain access to the document signed at the VI. Ordinance of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the Chancellor of State and Presidential Office initially shared that they would be passed after the clause, but then declared that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian Government website.
In the matter of the text, they indicated that the content of the press was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the President's meeting was transferred to the pressroom with the announcement "private sitting, limited audio".
The few information that was circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Hungarian governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speakers.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media to be dissatisfied with the request for more information.
The President of Peru then sent an e-mail to the media with the "expression" of the summit, but it was about the declaration of Humala and not about the official document on the conclusion of the summit.
Last October Peru Guest of the Third Gipfels South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the pressure from the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which was previously announced, was published less than once.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems for journalists were available, but in a high degree limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint obligation of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment from the Hague Court of Justice which marks a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH which began on Monday in The Hague, in the process of launching the Lima against Santiago to join the Pladoyers.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile was, is and continues to remain a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concluded agreements and is subject to the international judicial authorities," Piñera adds, adding: “Humala with a hand-pressure before both sides of the country.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit themselves to the IGH was successful after Colombia after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which was a serious error, in which it had filed a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which allowed them to submit the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the wedding, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011, has not participated in the meeting.
The host President Olanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State reported that 16 decisions were taken and 31 lines of action were set between South American countries over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
To the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He shared that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) cannot accept any triumphal trains, but should serve to extend our production performance and show our people a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects that should improve space connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas, and thus unite our countries and conclude new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a statement read.
Among these projects were five Peruvian people who were placed on the Querachs of his area from the coast to Brazil, two of which were to provide better contact with Ecuador, although there were no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its re-entry into the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meetings in Mexico on Saturday, he expected a meeting with him against Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal with the maritime conflict after a decision of the IGH raised by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua requires talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present when the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, is taking office.
As part of the summit, the defence minister of the block was also in the forefront of the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan, in which dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the president at the time of the regional block.
"South America needs to learn about citizens' integration," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with South America actually learning something from Europe.
Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, stated state television in Peru that Europeans "are engaged in the second world war and other austerity" and "now are practically a parent country."
In this regard, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship which the Member States of the Union are moving forward.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still more reactive sectors that want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the rule of reducing the influence of the English states and taking into account those who signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and on the contrary, we will always sign everything for the South Americans.
"It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has established its seat in Washington and will be funded by the United States," he said as a response to the political asylum that Ecuador has given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensured that he did not regret this decision because he had not abandoned his principles but had followed his "deep democratic values and views of human rights".
He added that his time "has given reasoned doubts that Assange would be delivered to a third country and his procedures would not be kept."
He also criticised the Swedish justice that he had requested to bring him under trial in his state area because of a alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish court has allowed this through a video conference that could have been carried out over the Ecuadoran message in London."
Correa stated that the risk was that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he's been in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the messenger has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs but is not serious," said the state chief of Ecuador.
However, there is the risk that he will take physical and mental damage because he has been caught in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises in free space.
"That would affect every person's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution for the asylum, which has been provided since June in the Ecuadoran message in London, was the provision of a free enterprise to which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the British, Swedish and European legal authorities. He stressed that it had given London talks to find a solution for the reasons why WikiLeaks was blocked.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but it has given constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures at different European institutions," he said.
And "If Britain gives this letter tomorrow, this is what I think is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange heard about the message of Ecuador in London or about Skype, how it was allowed and done in other cases, the problem would be raised.
Correa used the opportunity to prove herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate, "the media, the evil intentions and lies that conquered the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and oppressive politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and pressure to win," he said.
In this sense, he wished that Ecuador would no longer be governed by such journalists "and not even by the banks or hegemonic and spying countries", and took into account that it "will deepen the revolution in order to continue its path towards this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, which he argued that the organisation "should remain firm and must not hold on to opportunism and no state party legally dressed," because "the legitimacy of democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."
In addition, the President of Ecuador expresses the desire of his Colombian opponents, Juan Manuel Santos, now and in accordance with the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries "absolutely entitled."
This Decision is not to be implemented at this time.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in a common way.
They must be treated in a comprehensive manner so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion on the dispute between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and thought that "it is right for Latin America to call on international courts if both countries are committed to accept the judgment, even if it falls very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he would become a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate, he pointed out that he "sees this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although it sometimes seems very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never been personally interested in me, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this possible victory, so I must take this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I would get out of public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a return to the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the South American Nations (UNasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS today is too late to recognize
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the study: HIV positive.
"It was like if a bomb was involved," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, which the doctor "has tried to make out."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit at the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to predict in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmatized.
At that time it itself refused to accept the director of an IMSS clinic "because it led to a case."
At that time it was AIDS Synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic who do not know anything about their disease and who have already caused damage to the virus and have created their immune system and who are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success of today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said HCG leader Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported in April of this year by a scientific publication.
The expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that scientists have concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a cause of death, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immunization of people at the beginning of treatment, and that they had greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years in the number of 200 CD4 and 50 years in the number of 500 CD4.
Simply stated, the above statements mean that whoever gets the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 can become "without problem 75 years old as long as he is under control", said this expert.
In order to make this progress properly, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is still true that 60 per cent of the patients diagnosed in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only in Jalisco died in 2011, 255 people died, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is ensured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
So why do people still die from it?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's how it's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the medications. The problem is that people are in a very advanced condition because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He says: "Nine of ten patients come to us when they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence the global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so that all persons with this need to be offered massive recognition tests."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the State Council Statal de Preventción del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also patients such as Fabrizio who conducted his test in a private laboratory, and this is the only reason that he had made a friend who, despite his young age, had already been in the AIDS phase and had even the kaposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then I'd rather put three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, drive sports and take drugs.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I work very much, I have an active, but responsible sex life, I care about my health and the other person," Fabrizio says, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILINIO JALISCO in order to admire those who today are afraid of AIDS.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as responsible people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the loading table
There are great gaps between health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously given separately, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces which are good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need this?" is a wide-ranging issue of social workers, guidance staff in schools, staff in apothecs and in the health system that young people do not want to stand up, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to redirect this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the loading system but should be in public toilets which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and coins, as Governor Emilio González answered the question whether they would be distributed Preservatively under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already have sexual activity," he pointed out.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen at 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and at 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of seizures occur through sexual traffic, 6% through blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the Court of Justice of the United States has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the commitments of the Vitro Group reached by a trade competition in Mexico, an unfair precedent for each national company with authorisations in the neighbouring country has been created with the problem of payment.
Thus, it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws to exist in the country of stars and stripes in opposition to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas shows that Mexican companies are exposed to the seizure of their property outside the Bravo river.
However, the decision opened up to the largest producer of glass in Mexico Port and Tor to appeal for three inconsistencies to the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the Court of Justice points out that believers must be subject to the competition law of the United States, the Court of Justice of the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, says that it is the main procedure for dealing with the trade competition in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for the payment of the ability of companies with a foreign transfer profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the United Nations for the United Nations Union of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a lighthouse.
Secondly, the Court states that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the commitments in the competition mass which the branches of Vitro and their parent company had achieved, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by companies of the group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundes Institute for Trade Competition).
It is also true that following the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Justice.
On the other hand, Vitro is responsible for his difficult situation since 2008 in the United States as a result of the major economic crisis that struck the country.
For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family argues before the same Court of Justice in order to vote in the plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three voted.
If not performed, the Cerciorare claim, which requires the examination of the procedure by a higher authority, shall be lodged by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The gravity of this case is that the court has issued a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the Court), describing the procedure under which Vitro's law on trade competition is carried out and indicating that it was strictly in line with the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Act.
It will also be pointed out that the country has submitted to the United Nations Commission principles for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border payment capacity guaranteeing equal treatment of creditors and creditors.
Double caramboles: a battle for vitro and for the country.
General Balance
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Cooperation against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of mismanagement, several months ago, the Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The attempt by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now presented a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is called for intensification of justice.
The supervisory authority has subsequently systematically refused to inform the principal administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove from bank IXE F/589 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicoan de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrator Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental defenders, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon March in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a huge shopping and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, supplementing a residential area for the staff of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has managed to unite the rulers of the south to resist the monumental institution that destroyed the protected areas and the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the Government of a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the ACTA short notice, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had taken the opportunity out of consideration because it considered them to be an obstacle to the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex Long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings more than 500 million pesos on the market.
The Emission is the first of four equal emissions which promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Based on NYCE, e-Quality and Kernel, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was established under the name Competival, whose purpose is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are worth over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bomber of the basketball ball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to corps for more than 60 years and has prepared the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was a 6-year-old part of this sport, whether as players of lower classes, players of the first national league, officials and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball league.
"I have spent many years in basketball, even several times at the same time as I was president of the BSN, the Head of the National Mission and the President of the Alliance in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when he was visiting Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not go beyond this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with pictures and memories of his long career and look at them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those who, at his time, remembered Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old jubilee as a business director or director of the club.
"It was my best years, which I have enjoyed most, because I have been part of eight masters of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a business leader, associate director or trainer.
There were many years of fulfillment, including the five masterpieces from 1971 to 1975.
And then I agreed with a Master of 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's Debt at BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" has taken over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommends the free-town specialist Raymond Gausse, who left his citizens and was one of our best sellers.
I still know, as he said, that if Mincy could have made a masterpiece for Bayamon, he would have made a lot of money for another.
The Mastership of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but he was already out of range, since he was already at the top of the league in 1988.
At this time, he was about to enjoy his full-fledged and those of Mincy in the National Mission.
I still know when we first won the preolympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we were in charge of the fourth place, which would actually have been Bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian judge who had allowed us to resume the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It belongs to the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the crew of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and fought the US team, as at the time when they won against us at the Bronze World Championship.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toníto" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who were unable to do it because of a kidney injury in 1990.
A man who may not have been the best in terms of personality, with which we won a gold medal and which prepared us with great joy, was that of the preolympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and the young Rolando Hour routiner as a substitute for the disabled players because of the events on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won against any forecast the gold medals.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculin.
And this is not to be taken into account in what he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in this connection?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Mission from 1988 to 1995, which covered the BSN from the 1990s to 17 men in one season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That boys in Ponce, for example, play only in their area and only meet in national playoffs on missions from other parts of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the results of the required training and courses for trainers, desk officials and judges.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my single children and quit and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoyed the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was known worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the "Dallas" television series where he played a homeless, domestic and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the olmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the Habgier of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. to a new staff of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a press release by The Associated Press by Warner Bros., manufacturer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that most loved him," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the funeral feast.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy he could.
He was creative, great, funny, wise, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life in full trains," Gray explained in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver zirzorrhosis in 1992 and said he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995 a bad tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years prior to "Dallas" Hagman was known on television as the next type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Bezauberde Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life was put on his head when he met an attractive "dark" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also the founder of two comedys that were only recently exposed, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colours".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the most persuasive J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS TV series on the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The talk "Who shot J.R.?", which was expected to create an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were committed in lawhouses.
That's why the series achieved a watch record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators, which "Dallas" has been translated into the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s weaknessr (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had made it difficult and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, inflexible man with a charismatic smile: a persistent businessman and an unfaithful husband who then tried to expose his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s gravestone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here's the honored citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, founder of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as a "great personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgettably and irreprehensible for millions of admirers in the world, and he remains with us those who have the joy of knowing and loving him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second table was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rolled, the sender informed.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT about how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actor and singer Mary Martin, the classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she met Larry during her marriage with Lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theaters in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he learned about the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu for a long time, where many prominent people lived.
In 2001 he published his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Number (and Absolutely True) Talks about My Life".
"I didn't write anything from which I thought it might harm someone or affect him in some way," said the Associated Press.
After liver transplantation, he worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help young patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations go ahead and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it'll be good for you".
He also took part in several campaigns against smoking.
The start of the course that "the end of the world" examines
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistencies: the end of the "long return count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, by many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect of him in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which has named some as "Deudarmagedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic seminary that ever existed," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we had been away for thirty days, this would be a really good period.
And he remembers that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this seminar, which should actually be the last in history, course on "the end of the world".
In Temple Professor Barry Vacker has the course "medium, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material reaches the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari formed a team to offer a course with the title "The End of the World".
"We do not take 2012 in order to keep the option to resume the course again in order to prevent the world from falling apart," Restall said.
Despite the "primary transition" students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final test will be carried out on the pre-apocalypse evening, why the students have no other chance than "to work through the night where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for high-level students, which was filled with 35 students.
A week before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were any places available.
The students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a question of trust or its shortcomings.
The 25-year-old student Will Weekesa explains for Psychology and Disease Care to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I've heard something from a teaching where this is taught," he said.
I'm having a good time.
But none of the students asked - and less than one professor - said to believe in the last date of 21 December.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Tellen, a student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that brings back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the anticipation of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other words, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dugherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches this year to the Philippines, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as a reference to an exception to a higher authority.
We have a duty from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days had been spoken by the Court of Justice, saying that if nothing happened on 21 December, "the people immediately think of a new date" or of philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period, which led to the end of the world.
Students and teachers take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
