One of the reasons why Twitter is so popular in Japan is a characteristic of Japanese itself: Japanese uses the ideologies that allow us to collect more information in 140 characters than other languages, without considering Chinese.

She also ignores the most basic notions of science.
I suppose it makes sense to go ahead and pay the account now.
Have you ever been out with them?
Tom decided to slow down.
It would have been terrible.
We need to do our best to change things.
The boy was setting up a car park in the lake.

It's funny, isn't it?
She wasn't your sister.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
This object is currently exhausted.
Tom's very clever.
He won't believe what happened today.
Can I take a photo?
I remember your name.
We called our White dog.
He was himself drugging Layla.
It's not the length of life, it's its depth.
It's so stupid, I swear I don't support it.
We'll take it.
Do you really believe in her?
I know a girl who smiles all the time.
I'll never betray her trust.
Tom understands what I mean, I think.
I wish Tom were here with us today.

You got the spaghetti.
How dare he have sex with my wife?
He threw the ball on the first base.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are satisfied.
He is not interested in his English lessons.
I had fun last night.
Tom doesn't want you to do it.
Tom's rich, but he's not happy.
Take the table out, please.
This is a great dress.
I did what I was asked to do.
I keep writing to Tom sometimes.
We just need to find him.
Can I see you again?
Let's solve this problem together.
Is this the first time you've done this?
Should I give this to Tom?
Do you have friends?
I helped him.
She's really tough.
The rest is history.
Tom is used to staying up all night.
We won't be here soon.
We can come caught.
So you got your hair on your chest after all.
I just need a minute.
What colors were they?
She's a strange guy.
We don't have to talk in the library.
I want my daughters to learn to speak French.
I'm shocked.

I'll take care of you.
Sami's talking a little Arabic, but he can't read it.
Tom never gets anything for Christmas.
Tom was always critical.
I'm holding my fingertips.
Where'd you get that?
You shouldn't have missed out on me.
Every day my money.
You're still the first weapons!
I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
This box contains memes.
Tom can do it for us?
If you have time, we'll go shopping.
You're back home now?
I thought I'd go with her.
Hey guys, I think I found something.
I had no idea you were so stupid.
I can't trust you.
Tom seems upset.
What course are you recommending?
The long journey increased its incontinence.
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.
He did what he was told.
Tom gave Mary a banana.
Is it legal?
I don't know I'm Japanese.
We're really having fun.
We should let her rest.
There's no time for it.
I know you don't know him.
Please, bring us two cups of coffee.
I still have friends in Boston.
Were you jealous of them?
I'm sure Tom's not Canadian.
I want to be sure.
It's starting tomorrow.
Can you speak up?
I'll see her again next Friday.
In modern computer systems the umlaut and the following are represented in the same way.
I don't believe in a story like that.
What exactly is Tom referring to?
The bird flys.
Can I call her tomorrow?
She lives in Kyoto.
He was close to Tom.
I hate the course.
Write in Arabic.
We're divorced.
I've been helped by my father to paint the knife.
Tom's reasonable.
Look at the video.
The subject of the discussion is wrong.

That word describes her perfectly.
Do you like my cake?
I'm not invincible.
She doesn't like anyone.
Just tell him not to worry.
I'd like to see Tom.
That house needs repairs.
I didn't get this fight.
She's deaf and she's moving, and she's getting really blind.
I still have to finish my tasks.
Tom didn't want coffee.
He won't believe us.
Don't try to scare me.
I'm proud of you.
Tom still can't get Mary out of his head.
I can cook.
I'm playing basketball with them.
I was from the barbie.
Speak slowly, please!
Tom has long hair.
Don't give up too much.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Did you know Tom and Mary were good golfers?
Who is she to decide?
Why don't the police stop Tom?
He's shooting her.
You're still in the kitchen, aren't you?
I can't talk to my girl.
At least he's not fixing his heart.
Let me tell you why I don't like Tom.
How did you get in?
I was fired at the exam because I didn't study.
He was ready.
We need to find Tom before he makes himself empty.
Don't expect mercy.
John told you the truth.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
We'll miss your smile.
If time allows, we leave within an hour.
I'm not as lucky as you.
Tom and Mary asked for the best working conditions.
It's important for you to keep this secret.
We should start looking for Christmas gifts for children.
She refused to pay.
Tom called his dog Cookie.
I'll send them.
Tom decided to buy a house.
I'm too young to drive a car.
He's stronger than I am.
I'm the last one he's ever seen.
I'll watch her.
That man is a soldier.
I thought Tom was guilty.
I sounded that song so much that I could do it while I was asleep.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
I can't stop laughing.
South Africa became independent in 1961.
I think Tom's eating right now.
I could've done better.
I have some English books.
Can you make them laugh?
Tom can go if he wants.
I want to work with you.
I like to wear sports clothes.
Why were you so short?
Tom and Mary were running for the weekend.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who is he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Tom lives here with you?
What's the problem, dear?
I don't want them angry.
Tom's really sick?
The hair hasn't been washed.
I read your letter yesterday.
She's going to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my uncle's husband's nephew's nephew?
I think so.
She was having fun with her son's luggage.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
It was the first one to help her.
Are the kids already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe you should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a drink, guys.
I like your painting.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I studied at the University of Hyogo.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went on without problems.
No one wants to help us.
They're talking very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
There's a lot of skeletons in these parts?
Tomorrow, if God wants, we'll be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fishing with the liquids.
I feel safe.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born in October.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep right now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works where?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't waste my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being ever sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
It's embarrassing.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom's upset.
I'm old.
I've got the fucking criminal fedin.
Good night, my friend.
I bought a book in English in a library.
Tomorrow I'm going to the library to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us some interesting stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Me and Tom still love us.
Tom needs to eat.
Let's all go.
The giant pandas live only in China.
I'm coming after you.
Don't say anything like that.
It's worse!
Jim's Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where have all the others gone?
I'm relaxed.
The animal was crawling in the field.
He got involved in his private life.
Can I borrow your coat?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still absent.
I ate all the honey.
Drag the bakri while the pen is heated.
Is the park open today?
We're only preparing raw food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop bludgeoning.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately my birthday is only once a year.
Get out of your bike.
I understand it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt Pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It upsets me.
Who do you think she told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem so surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's inflexible, isn't he?
Does this cage have a purpose to protect from the rocks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I'd like you to call me.
Don't you want a job?
I sounded the trumpet when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
To write in braille?
I don't know what he's got.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
I ate a honey.
I caught him.
He's adopted the orphanage.
I imagine they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to become more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
He's a smoker.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than him.
What will this summer do?
He became angry.
Can you speak Shanghai?
He was restricted because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom asked what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like the wrong movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't treat the kid.
Am I in London?
She's still there with her, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with me.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after the storm.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Hey, Tom, on my side.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I'm usually naked.
Why are you leaving soon?
I'm rather proud of you.
I feel a smell of gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your photo.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed its theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It's happened that I sat next to her at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up soon for the lesson.
It's kind of superfluous, isn't it?
Who's the man who's singing the piano?
I decided not to repeat it.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I'm sleeping in a car.
Me and Tom are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his drinks.
Search for more on Google!
It's not your only problem.
You're talking like you were the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I've come to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you hear any instruments?
They're dying?
I really like it.
Are you going in?
Tom pushed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
He wants us to do this.
He convinced the teacher.
When does his new novel come out?
I wouldn't ever betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I'll never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
She's not crying today.
He promised to write me every week.
I'm not born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
You're gonna get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I'm right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether to drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Abbia believes in God.
"I'll give him 50 miles for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used machine.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like this.
He can park here.
Please tell him to get out of here.
Tom's just leaving.
I like it almost every day.
I'm not gonna apologize.
We really like a lot of picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a summer evening.
I'm always on my feet.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He's been looking for the keys to the car in his bag.
I really don't want to talk.
So it's got to be silver.
I really like my job.
I'll suggest you be more careful.
It's gone.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
She'll be out in the afternoon.
It's getting dark.
We're working on a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that frame?
How many are the continents of the world?
It's good to sing, isn't it?
Tom's angry with Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Baccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese instead of another language.
I'm still engaged.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park in the morning.
Tom loves fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should've changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still sleeping.
Tom's a little excited, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but it's what you want.
Can you ask Tom to stop after work?
He sounds the drum.
It must be hot.
What dictionary do you use more?
You burned the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before we came to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German machines are among the best.
I'm calling.
That's it.
Tom doesn't respect Maria's opinions.
I'll go to the field.
He's here to listen to jazz.
You really think Tom's pretty?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are rather engaged.
He took care of me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I had plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
Do you want to go on a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We need to relax and relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I've been three years more than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said it was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you never got anything to say?
Scandalos!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep the tongue in its place.
I drank wine.
He's more popular than I am.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
Do you want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is more heavy than iron.
I'll find you later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm at the hospital.
Did you call them?
Take off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a professor?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Excuse me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us? We're in Europe!
You were expecting a bus.
I'll find the chemistry.
You'll never find out where I am.
I wasn't okay.
I'm going to study you've had to be diligent.
I'm not gonna be able to help them.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappears behind a cloud.
You are interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I can't drive very well.
I heard Tom was learning how to drive.
She knows she loves her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is we don't know where Tom is.
You're under bed, aren't you?
I hit the shoulder with an ass.
The minivans are back in fashion.
There's some books on the table.
Come at least at least six.
I got a lot of work to finish by weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
It's two years older than him.
French is hard.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You've got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for more than ten years.
We're grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting me home with an ammonium electromagnetic object is very appealing to me.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run behind the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why don't I buy you a hat and enough?
I thought Tom would have made himself alive.
She's got bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like mountain?
My daughter likes to play with the balls.
Come on aboard.
She's fascinating.
People drinking tea in their country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go wake them up.
What's wrong with your teeth?
You need to read between lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little distracted by Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe in a word of what you say.
Take off your dose!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
I'll be a Volgari.
Tom's getting better.
We can help them.
They called us.
I think Tom should be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
Again!
Why are these things always happening to me?
Birds are hitting the ground.
The park is closed Monday.
Didn't even update the firmware?
I got a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
I like all my friends.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's doing practice.
Are you coming in?
Which way should you start?
Have you studied Darwin's evolution theory?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth visiting the ruins.
You should be ready for the worst.
Tom's gonna take out the suitcases from the bag.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your target number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the stage.
She bought me a nice hat.
The bell sounded.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm in love with her.
We have to postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We smoke separately.
It's now.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This is my captain.
He doesn't have a few friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Do you read this book at night?
Tom has a car?
I'll be fine. Don't worry.
Tom laughs rarely.
I can't forget her smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know Canadians living in Australia?
Tom's jealous, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do they like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom doesn't like it very much.
Can you wash the dishes for fun?
The lunch was great.
She spent her computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remember.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
You feel like you're closing the door.
He's done it.
How do you feel today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
I remember my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're worth it.
I don't feel nervous.
She's got a big call.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you going to do about this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the volupe with its ball has reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is trusted with my older sister.
My father always interferes with my private life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like it.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be out of the house.
What do you tell us to go out and make a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Tom and Mary are all right?
Contracting is common in the markets.
It's saved.
I'm sorry about the accident.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want you to see this.
How many reni has a human being?
A saved money is a earned money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It's been red.
Don't bother him.
We were good.
She started acting strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
She left this, didn't she?
Say something.
You're casual.
Please lower the music.
I trained Tom for work.
He was watching him eat it.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children were playing together.
Tell him again, please.
You're bothering her.
Sami's not here to ruin your day.
You took my shoes off.
I'm learning hope now.
He took mercenaries to kill Sami.
What are yours?
The woman's drinking water right now.
Tom was a lawyer.
The people here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is low cost, it will soon close the boots if the food doesn't have a good taste.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
She changed her diet.
He's a man of the word.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too high?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
You guys were drunk?
Are you interested?
Tom cut himself and his pulses.
It's so bright.
You should've kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't license Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a user store.
Why don't you just leave her alone?
He's finally here!
Tom thinks everyone's gonna be here in the middle of the day.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't make any sense.
You're lying.
She helped him.
They were all talking about us.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates the masses.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was engaged.
Where's my money?
No one's seen them do it.
Tom didn't read any of these books.
You're still inexplicable.
I have to go to work now.
You're coming too soon.
It's able to speak ten languages.
Come home before it's empty.
I got off the train to the wrong station.
I hated French to the top.
You shouldn't be home with your mother?
He's got blue eyes and blue hair.
I can't understand.
Tell him who you are.
My name looks wonderful.
I'll never forget that night.
Please add an exclamation point to all your phrases!
Can you see anything in there?
I'll be ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't remember.
I don't want to forget it.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They're traditional.
I'll stay.
I'm not always committed.
I'll see you.
You raised me before the white.
I'll be right behind you.
Why did he live in Kobe?
We're approaching.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try taking some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He's asking how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom's a gold boy.
It seems to be against ideas from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She's making me scream.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're less than three years old than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give me the order.
Do you know Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom doesn't get angry.
The rock was moved with the dynamite.
Mary's gonna prepare the breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can hold him.
This smell is unacceptable.
It's become famous.
What are you saying?
You'd become friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's got her thumb.
We gotta go.
Staying home isn't fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank nearby.
I don't like that.
Can you be sure?
I'd love to see her.
She doesn't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He wants to go clearly.
I knew Tom would have done something romantic.
How many letters does he use?
Can you confirm it?
It was a money spill.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring me some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It's just a coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My ass is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the photo.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did he eat?
He's the last person who can say a lie.
Even June isn't that far.
Why does Tom hate you so much?
Do you know who said it?
I'm going to bed soon tonight.
I fell out of the house.
I'm tired of shoes.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?
You always like Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't take Tom's game.
You landed on your feet.
I've been running risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
I know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to take it.
Yesterday night my grandmother disappeared without suffering.
I know why you're angry with them.
You know Tom likes machines.
She passed the exam.
Tom was like Mary.
I can read Spanish easily.
Do I have to use the incision?
Don't fall off the seat.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Tom can't notice?
Children usually go up to Christmas soon.
I'll be your guide.
How long has English been studied every day?
Why does he look confused?
I can't do anything for you.
The father's fine.
I think they're ready.
Tom's gonna try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a table game.
They all believed in him.
This means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are cries of cocodril.
He might have said something before.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I got girls every thirty minutes.
Tom's much older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's a badass.
He's got to help them.
I write to my mother sometimes.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm sorry I've never been kind to him.
Make Tom call me.
Nothing has changed.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why isn't he sitting with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.

Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
Did you get anything from him?
I'm still afraid of Tom.
Do you like these songs?
He lied to me many times.
She likes sports, doesn't she?
How beautiful!
