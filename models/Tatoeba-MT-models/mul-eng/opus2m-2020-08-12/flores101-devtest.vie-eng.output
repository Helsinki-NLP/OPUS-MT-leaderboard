The relationship between brain disease and behavioral support for scientists in their research program.
We have long learned that various types of brain damage, injuries, diseases, and disabilities affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technology allows us to observe and study structures and too many brain programs we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and data to build models that help us understand brain programs.
Although human consciousness (AI) has a great meaning in thinking science, AI also has an extremely important role in computer science, behavioral management, the ability to learn and to play and master the mind of the brain.
Research into the human brain involves the creation of self - reproducing machines that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and programing, the ability to respond to customer predictions and questions, as well as to recognize signposts, voice, and facial expressions.
