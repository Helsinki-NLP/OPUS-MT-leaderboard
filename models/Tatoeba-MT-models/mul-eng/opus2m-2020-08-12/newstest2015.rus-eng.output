FANO Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will, together with RAN, hold the third expert session “Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be concluded in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, as reported in the press release in the latent.Ru.
The third meeting plans to submit the results of the annual expert session and to draw up a list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Several participants planned to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The third expert session will be an ongoing event for the development of a uniform approach for all three academics to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have done so, and the resulting version of the normative documents is in agreement.
At the close of the next session, we should complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said FANO Director of the Expert and Analytical Management of Russia, Elena Axsenov.
More than a hundred representatives of the Russian scientific institutions will take part in the event.
As a result, it is expected that the resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin on 10 a.m. after Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the following address: Moscow City, Solanca Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to discover family stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulence and its impact on chemical diversity in stars.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will allow the star to search for family members, which is from one classroom.
The results of their studies were published in the magazine Nature and are brief on the university website.
Because of the same chemical composition of nearby stars, there is a disturbing shift in gas clouds prior to star education.
Even if the birth of the star then leaves the star cluster, it is chemically possible to determine the place of birth and the region of birth of the star family.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of stars outside the classroom could lead to a difference in their chemical content from that of family members in the classroom.
The results of the modelling by astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputers modeled two inter-vehicle gas streams that formed the cloud together.
This facility has been transformed into a classroom for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists have added greenhouse gases to their original gas flows and have found that high levels of chemical diversity are achieved through rapid turbulence.
According to astrophysicists, their studies have shown that chemical-generated stars can be sought, as well as possible regions of such objects.
Karrati Police arrested 20-year-olds after high-speed motorcycling
The motorcycle was confiscated after it had passed at a speed of 125 km/h in the area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through the bushland to hide from the police in Pillbar.
The transport police patrol in Carrate tried to stop the heavy motorcycle this morning, discovering that its speed was 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police reported that the motorcycle driver had not stopped and continued his movement on Berges Road and then returned to Bušland, resulting in the police losing him.

Lavour: Russia will not be "opening" for new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "stitch the door" for new sanctions.
IDF Chief Sergey Lavrov made this statement today, speaking to the students and teachers of IGIMO.
In the light of our response to the new wave of anti-corruption sanctions, I will not even discuss, imagine, because everything must be taken into account, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners like this time, we will decide how to respond.
It's not going to be related to the boy's door, any attempts, lyingly understood,' the Minister stressed.
We will, above all, refrain from the interests of our own interests, the interests of protecting our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business and the conclusions of our partners in terms of their adequacy, treaty ability and reliability.
As a result of the action taken in the area of sanctions, it can be very good to consider what partners are getting,” continued the MID RF head.
If they say in all voice that "the sanctions will also be sick for us, but we have to go to Russia to punish," that's probably not quite enough."
With regard to the outcome of the IMF in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we would like to be more active in the development of WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we consider to be the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping and has been subjected to anti-dumping measures against the RF economy.
"We are ready to work on WTO mechanisms and to suspend our position on the inability to apply EU third energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How can you use cheese in your garden?
Irina Okuneva answers:
Since after the harvest the cheese loses its main appeal, it is willing to raise it together with other customers.
It is beautifully linked with many cultures.
It is also possible, therefore, to be cultivated along with cheeses that are both ornamental at other times and blooming at the same time.
Another plus cheese is that it provides a mass of opportunities for creation.
You can make it a tree of different heights, improved coastal coastal coastal coastal coast, and even like a garden buns -- a tree with an amazingly decorated structure.
Just choose the form that best fits the design of your garden.
The Leningrad area was convicted of money laundering in Karelia
As reported in the Republican MVD, the man was involved in his criminal activity in the Olonech and Segegian regions.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes and in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting the Vologo area, where he has been sentenced to two and a half years of deprivation of liberty this spring.
Later, the man was brought before the Oloneck District Court.
And in order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segegë.
In the investigation there was evidence of several cases of individual cash delivery for 2013.
At the end of June this year, criminal matters were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the Court decided to replace the term of four years ' deprivation of liberty with a general regime.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Remember, in the past week, two other money changers were convicted of fraud, which they had been paid for in Peter’s warehouses.
Azerbaijani citizens also arrived in Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them lost five years of freedom, the other four.
Each one has a fine of 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force legally.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first "Dervish" in Arghangelska
Mitting, which was at the center of the area, was dedicated to the first Arctic converge.
Dervis provided military assistance to the SSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
At the Archangelical Memorial, a memorial was passed on to the future memorial of the participants of the northern convoy, which is located on the nearby name of Sedov in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arkangelska, children of the academic class.
We first met two and a half years ago when a storage stone was placed.
But also today's event is not a holiday, but a day to remember those who haven't returned to the sea," said the Veterans Council President of North Sea Passage Boris Karpov.
Then the city spirit orchestra was presented, and the academics of the Cadet classes gave flowers to the veterans and expanded with the Russian flag and the name of the winner.
The Mitting was finished with the painting of flowers to the castle stone.
The ship itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic material (10 000 tons of cotton, 1,500 tons of formal boots, leather, leather and numerous other inventory and equipment).
In addition, there were 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines on board ships, 15 Harrickin users, in a condition understood.
At the same time, 16 United Kingdom WMF ships, including two aircraft, were constructed.
The Charawan of the Tribunal was not discovered by the opponent and reached the point of appointment of the Archangelical.
Of the 848 ships involved in life-threatening operations, 126 ships and about 50 military vessels were killed.

I remember the very American idea that labour rights are human rights.
The Congressmen of Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill protecting the trade union as a civil right.
"Where the trade unions, there and the workplaces of the middle class," says Ellisson, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the Promotion of the Rights of Workers together with the symbol of civil rights movement by John Lewis.
This innovative bill provides workers with the same legal opportunities for the organization of trade unions, as well as other forms of discrimination, with the remaining strength of trade union opponents
Amendment of the Law on the Regulation of Labour Relations in such a way as to allow workers who are discriminated against to participate in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Luis and the co-authors of the bill offer is to remember the very American idea.
Despite the attacks by the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans have ever supported the countries of the world in order to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time when millions of Americans still remembered when this country at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of print and the right to an organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the war-encompassed authoritarian Hideki Todzey was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the formation of new Japan, they included the text that directly recognized that "the right of workers to an organization, to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the Fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, Germany included an article which openly stated: "The right to establish associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every profession or area of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to violate this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as unlawful.
When former Leader Eleanor Russell was President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which made up the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Russell and his constituents included the assurance that “every person has the right to organize and enter a trade union to protect his or her interests”.
The United States has adopted the basic rule that labour rights are human rights.
When that country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to trade unions - and that this trade union - should be protected as a equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American idea that workers should have the right to an organization and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
As similar to Martin Luther King Young said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation but increased them.
At the lower standard of living millions, trade unions have created markets for industry and have raised a whole nation at an unprecedented level of production.
Those who attack a trade union forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
History reminds us of how it should be.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and increased protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations has long been growing.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis are rebuffing ideas that have historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the introduction of the Law of Louisiana, which his party said would soon end all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Lucian Bobby Ginadlom in June and was to enter into force on 1 September, doctors making abortions would be required to have the authority to take patients into the hospital at 30 miles from their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
"Employers will be allowed to work legally, continuing to exercise their powers," wrote Judge John DeGrewells in his decision.
The hearing will be held within a month on which the judge will make a more lasting decision on this law.
The defenders of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, last in the list of similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain medical powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be protected from the penal law, which seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Norpta, President and Director of the reproductive rights centre, who requested that three of the five state clinics cease to act.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision to doctors from two clinics who did not speak in this case was related to the decision and the decision was also made on the authority to accept it.
Louisiana belongs to 11 States that have adopted such laws and have recently recognized such measures as non-institutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key elements of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The fight against abortion, together with the American College of Sugars and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, says that adoption rights laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary for medical purposes.
Opposers claim that such measures are intended to protect women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of the clinic.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights has been informed that only one doctor, who is undergoing abortion in Louisiana, has the authority to take care of the hospital.
If all other doctors in the state had to stop carrying out this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would have ceased to carry out this procedure, the group reported.
In critical terms, officials of Louisiana said that they would not be punished by doctors who had abortions until their statements on the authority of the decision had been made.
The introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of all goods in commercial networks should be Russian production, the representative of the Gosdoma of the “Justice Russia” Group of the Oleg of the Niles.
Parliament prepared a draft law aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, in which the newspaper " Esquisition " was written.
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discounts for buyers.
This applies to goods which are not produced in Russia, and according to the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the Reuters should provide at least half of its sections to domestic producers," Nilov reported.
Along with amendments to the article “On the basis of public regulation of trade in the RFG”, the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code setting the reduced rate of NDS in 10 per cent for the production of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota into trade networks is a package of incentives for Russian producers.
The catches will appear several times more domestically.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the Nalogovic company, a member of the Independent Expert Centre of the General Duma, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for local agricultural and food industries, will have a positive effect and will contribute to growth.
In addition, there are farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means the income will grow.
They will also have the right to give Reuters their terms and prices because they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activity and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some of which will be rapidly absorbed, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, the truth, not immediately," the expert noted.
Former Russian companies were often unable to catch local stores because of high competition by foreign analogues.
Now, after the ambargo was introduced, this knife was released and can be lifted with relief.
But it is worth noting that after all the necessary agreements and health checks on the Russian market, food goods from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be obtained.
In other words, it's now time for a quiet moment when the previous games have already gone down and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Less than a month later, we can talk about increasing demand for domestic goods and increasing prices for ready-to-production," said IIF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization "Russian Financial Directors' Club", i.e. Tamara Casyanov.
In particular, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will help strengthen the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are subject to subsidies from another State.
In other words, the fight against buyers is divided between companies working under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of the participants not far from all articles.
In this case, trade networks must "add" the share of Russian goods to half the assortment.
As a result, there is a growing fear that poor goods will be caught.
It is possible that foreign products will be placed under the same type as those produced in Russia with broken labels," the expert adds.
The negative impact of quota imports is felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperating with importers.
It is reasonable that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer in this way, as demand for their production will decline.
Lithuania does not rule out that the quota law on domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may fall under the quality of imported analogues, while stores may be able to charge prices for the second, as for the defective goods.
In February of this year, the idea of import replacements was re-examined by economists as a result of the continued development of the ruble.
In view of the lack of relations with the West, the issue of refusal to import products is becoming even more relevant.
The Act calls for the obligation of distributors to be considered to be native producers when issuing orders for suppliers.
Then we will be much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system will be established in a shorter period of time," says Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for agricultural sectors where capacity is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector where the rate of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover the catch of Russian shops.
In addition, powerful pulses can also produce meat.
As is known, the largest proportion of imports remains per capita - from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It is obtained that 65 to 70 per cent are still coming to Russian production," Kasyanov argues.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products is conducive to import and can accelerate this process.
However, this initiative does not itself lead to the introduction of this initiative, as this requires the package of measures that Lithuania believes need.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may be equally imported outside the border, which means that full import is not going to occur, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
At the same time, quotas must still be established in the country for the production of domestic products in order to meet those quotas.
These quotas are as guaranteed once and provide such guarantees," the expert noted.
Immediate diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother, James, published a video to remember their deceased mother, who died of cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death than women living in cities.
Researchers have analyzed more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Dr. Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Research QIMR Berghofer reported that it is more likely to die during the study than in urban areas.
FURTHER APPLICATION: New medicines can slow down the blood of mildews and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and the socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that immediate diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of travel services that would allow women to be treated closer to home and support programmes for people who were treated far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the duration of life among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young woman from the Gold Coast named Elisha Niev said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP will open the door in September in the Kugener region
The construction of the medical facility in the village of Toktibelek began in April of this year and was based on the model project.
The cost of work amounted to over 10 million rubles.
As reported by the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Marie El, financing of the construction of the facility was carried out through the Republican budget in accordance with the investment programme.
The total area of the medical-professional facility is almost 230 square metres.
There will be medical assistance for the population of eight population sites: the village of Toktibelak and the village of Dementievo, Puncherumal, Tunisia, Fomicia, Toribelak, Shinur and Chachajal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resources and its premises are not in accordance with health and hygiene requirements.
The new facility will be opened in the near future.
The murder of a four-month-old son in an emergency situation will be brought before the court
The Chuvashii castle is located on the shore of the perpetrators of the murder of their own child.
In Czechoslovakia, a criminal investigation was conducted against 31-year-old Novočeboxarska, who was charged with the death of a carefree person.
The result was that on 26 July of this year, the accused together with the four-month-old son came to celebrate the birth of his son ' s cousin in Cheboksari.
After a long table, the baby decided to stay in the guest room and let the baby sleep.
When the night fell and cried, an unsuspecting woman put her arm around her chest to calm the chest, but soon she fell asleep.
In time a woman fell asleep on her son, which led him to end up breathing.
The criminal case is reported by the SU SCR on Chuvashii, sent to the court.
Inflation came out of the rest.
Does the Russians feel a sharp increase in prices?
As a result of the overcrowded sanctions of the IMF and the West, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be included in the government's forecast, convinced by the “VTB Capital” analysis.
Experts believe that the effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, says RBC Daily.
According to the latest Millennium Development Project, inflation is 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and less than 6.5 per cent in the next year.
However, according to the "Commersant" newspaper, this week the MER should make "small but basic" corrections in the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the public could reduce the 2015 inflation assessment, which would eliminate expected inflation in the population.
It was predicted that food sanctions of the IMF would apply year-to-August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in this situation?
The current situation is expected to be sudden, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," stated the source of the newspaper in Minfina.
Economicists from the Capital WTB do not share the expectations of the Government's financial and economic blockade on inflation and predict the increase in prices in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product bans will be achieved together with possible introduction of sales tax (SIP) in the RF regions in 2015, convinced by experts.
The inflation rate is 9 per cent higher in February, after which the annual price growth rate falls, experts believe.
In fact, last week, Rostat gave the first inflational results after the IMF introduced "accuracy sanctions".
IIF.ru interviewed the experts and explained their inflational expectations.
Artem Dave, head of the FC AForex Analysis Department:
Price growth has already been observed in major segments of goods.
Moreover, when social goods were being transported, the Government had to take measures to monitor price stability in order to prevent the risks of undue price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and distributors are already reporting on a daily basis before regulatory bodies so that authorities know exactly who, when and why the price increase is initiated.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital flow, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the absence of people in foreign currency, and the embargo on imports of food goods from countries associated with sanctions against Russia.
If inflation had remained under control, the value of the minimum product collection would not have risen to 12 per cent in one quarter.
The prohibition on the import of foodstuffs has caused shock to the internal market and has led to a fully rational increase in the final value.
As we cannot fully implement the import arrangements at the current stage, as well as increase the independence of the Russian market through internal production, the sanctions will continue to pose risks to the growth of the inflationist.
If there are other fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Ravaev, Director of the Alpari Analytical Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, and in zero it was also above the current level, another case which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I believe that inflation is 8-8.5 per cent after the end of the year.
Platon Maguta, Managing WC assets, the Maguta Fund
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being maintained successfully, but if further pressure on the financial sector is to occur, above all, it can lead to some difficulties and to an increase in inflation expectations of people who are traditionally in the purchases of cash to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the IMF and the Ministry of Finance are trying to ease the widespread weakness of the ruble both by market methods and by public regulation.
But the price growth starts traditionally after the summer break and perhaps this autumn becomes more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5 per cent, most recently, as the IMF still has financial savings.
Farming centres are benefiting from a reduction in the number of households
Such a fall, resulting in an extremely low number of households under 35 years of age, may lead to the beginning of a ten million-pound per year when today's young consumers reach "the main age of farming", according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who take up their housing lose an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own households have lost to farming.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in high-urban-free areas, the popularity of house-to-house parking and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors that pose a threat to the industry whose annual sales are estimated to amount to £5 billion.
In Great London, where households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest cost of household farm goods in Britain is low.
HTA and the Royal Farming Society reported that renting housing and the absence of land does not mean that people cannot grow.
Guy Barter, Chief Farmer in RHS, said: "The growth of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular for tenants who can transport plants with them when they pass."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as "the golden century" of the different trade of agricultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of households and economic growth between the end of the 1980s and the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year through a better climate after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has carried out a mass cleaning in the Land Fund
Three of the four heads of the Landing Fund were replaced on Friday.
In general, three of the four heads of the Landing Fund were replaced on Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has only informed about the removal of the post of Executive Director, Atanas Dobreva.
His place was Lozana Vasileva.
Two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were later changed on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatyana Angelova, who has been responsible for State aid and SApard's programme so far, reports BGNES, referring to the newspaper "Trud".
I did not attend the board of directors because under the law we were not members of the board, but later I was informed that I was released.
I can't tell you why my release is not posted on the Fund's website.
I'm on vacation.

Turkey calls on the American diplomat for a report on spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has produced the highest American diplomat in the country for explanations on the report on the American and British spyage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Boulevant reported that the United States trusted in cases and Turkish officials discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snoudden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Taipe Erdogan reduced the importance of this communication, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
It was previously reported that the main intelligence agency of Germany had also made Ankaru an investigation, causing a more angry response to the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies united against Alibaba
China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and the Tencent Holdings Internet giants (sects, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese demand) are creating a company that will compete on the online market with Aliba.
However, it is not easy to detect the wonders of the Chinese Internet that have left behind even their American opponents - eBay and Amazon.com.
The Biggest Union
The companies are planning to invest 5 billion Yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of each of the Internet companies, says the Wanda Group.
Registration is planned in Hong Kong.
The IP will combine the search services of Badu with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial mobility facilities throughout China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan ($8 billion) in the construction of a cinema and thematic entertainment park in Cindeo (city of eastern China on the Black Sea).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring income to the level of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings network, which makes the company the world's largest film player.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to equip all its trading centres, hotels and entertainment facilities with e-commerce services, which are being developed as part of the Alibaba competition.
According to Don Cé, which will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase users of its e-commerce services from current 40 million to 100 million people by the next year.
The new platform must become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Don C.
The online-to-offline (O2O) business is involved in attracting online buyers to access regular online stores or other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is services for the sale of purchases of the species Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "Pirogue" in online commerce," said manager Wanda Van Czjanjinj (Bloomberg's quote).
“The current O2O area in China does not exist now, and in this situation the chance is almost equal to everyone,” he says.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase by more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, providing Bloomberg with official statistics: more people in any country of the world, except India.
And it is estimated that by 2015, this figure can grow to 850 million people.
A Controversy of Rich People
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten has been China's richest man recently, but according to the Bloomberg millionaires Index, founder Alibaba Jack Ma has already charged him with $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $22.8 billion, of which $11 billion is derived from his share in Aliba.
Leader Baidu Robin Li is now taking the third place among the richest people in China, while Van Czejanjynn from Wanda - fourth line of dating.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: three of the richest people are working together to bridge the challenges of even more rich," said Bloomberg, head of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce in Hanchjoo Cao Lee.
But he believes that the new company will hardly be able to compete with Aliba right after the creation of: "Rome can't build in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not only opposed by new companies but also by world trade leaders is evidence of the public concern over the recent quarter financial indicators.
Alibaba is often described as something medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but since April of June, China's company has worked more than both of its American competitors together.
Alibaba ' s net income for almost two times the same competitor ' s aggregated income increased almost three times a year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Aliba still has a great potential for money generation, thanks to its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg, an analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba's updated vision on the United States Commission's Web site, the number of active mobile users of the company ' s services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Aliba's transactions over the past quarter came to mobile devices.
Alibaba should be called the value of its actions before IPO.
According to an average assessment of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to the Bloomberg source, Aliba's debate at the New York Foundation Exchange (NYSE) can be held on 16 September.
Road-show companies prior to this event will start on 3 September.
Alibaba's exit to IPO is expected to become a record in the history of NYSE and will allow companies to attract about $20 billion.
To date, US$17.9 billion has been allocated to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 had initially moved its shares.
At least half of the food goods in trade networks should be Russian production, which is considered by Gosduma's MPs.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
This is the subject of amendments to paragraph 8 of the FZ, "On the basis of public regulation of trade in RF" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important explanation under the bill is that at least 50 per cent of domestic products in stores should be available for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods which are not being produced in Russia, such as fruit and fruit of the winter, so they will be made "cut" to avoid possible discounts for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law changes also in the IMF Tax Code, which establishes a reduced rate of NDS by 10 per cent in the implementation of all food goods originating in Russia, reports the "Exit".
On 27 August, a draft Law was introduced in the House of Parliament on Change in the O Diverse Markets of the FZ, which proposes to restore agricultural markets in Russia in which small producers can implement their products.
The Chief of the Magallup Police has been charged with corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of requests by the police and officials of the municipality of Kalvi in the office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorki on Friday.
The director of the Kalvia Police on the Kurt Island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and barkeepers in a scandalous center of Magallupe's untrustworthy drinking.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained on charges of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street where most of Magallup's bars and night clubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online release, the investigators presented evidence of police and police officers from the city of Calvia to the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorki to combat corruption on Friday.
Two other local police were arrested by the Guards of the National Guard of Spain for allegations of corruption and brought before the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that night club owners were saying that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about saving," one of the businessmen told the court.
We cannot threaten our sources of existence.
We're losing something.
Magaluf fell into the headlines of international press this year after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British spiritist who was running 24 men during a bar runoff.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop squashing in an emergency between the rest of Magalufs, leading to a minimum of scandalous alcohol escapes by bars.
In addition, Playhouse, where an incident occurred with a minute, was forced to close annually while Playhouse and Carnage Barnage escape organizers were jointly executed at €55,000 ($73000).
The tour tour of Magaluf, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also a place of many unfortunate cases of alcohol abuse associated with a foolish sport known as "balconing" when people come from one balcony to another or from a balcony in a guest pool.
The first day is marked by cold and wind conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
VISNA prepared a cold surprise for South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9 o'clock in the evening, after 6,6 mm in the night of the resurrection.
The last rain led to a pair of short-fledged windmills, including the threat that started up to 8 o'clock in the evening and lasted about 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter released an early spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday until the peak of 15.8C in the city.
The bad conditions are supposed to have served as one of the reasons for the delay in the arrival of the Virginia Airlines train from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land immediately after 7:30 a.m. but it was in the wind speed zone - a sudden change of speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and it had to be picked up.
Wind currents reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
These flights showed that the plane had to be lifted during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed at 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this trip has resulted in the subsequent delay of several other voyages, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
The maximum 16C is expected to be in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two elephants.
The calculation of construction facilities in the RF will take place again
Price education, construction industry regulation and network integration issues are under special control by the Federal Anti-Fraud Service.
The FAS has established an expert competition development board in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the Head of Control of the CPC, Construction and Natural Resources of the FAS Vadim Solovev stated that “the current calculation of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible”.
The normative base makes price-additional and can lead to an unreasonably price of construction, they consider to be in the FAS.
They also offer the value of building property at the design stage to determine on the basis of the market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current accounting standards and unit estimates for technological operations.
These proposals were presented in the road map and are now under review in the Minister.
“The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in construction on structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” Vadim Solovev explained.
As each bullet and needle is now being calculated, it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, uninformed construction companies can bury the whole tractor.
The FAS Minister agreed.
“The first recosting work on structural elements has already been developed: price calculation methodology for constructive decisions, calculation of these indicators,” told the head of the Department of Urban Activities and the architecture of Minister Elena Jukova.
As a pilot chosen road construction area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-Invest", Anatoly Demyanko, RGB, had long since grown, but another business mechanism had not yet been proposed.
“As far as the proposed structural elements are concerned, this is difficult to implement in practice, as buildings are often used in very different technologies,” he believes.
It is not a secret that the electricity market is being developed in many ways by means of the demand.
In the view of the President of the NP, Ekaterina Lesin, the "expert Community of Professionals of Hostages", the State is now the most paid-up contractor.
The Deputy Director of Engineering of the Capital Building Centre of Rosatoma Vladimir Malahov drew attention to the fact that today the market is subject to a distinction between companies having access to the portfolio of contracts and companies with monopolial competences and which do not allow for this field of competition.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market could only be possible where access to contracts would be maximumly limited by any administrative impact.
The expert council was invited to form a recruitment system in such a way that the same executive would not be entitled to receive more than one contract of more than 1 billion rubs or more than one billion rubs.
The Minister believes that this approach should be assessed from a business perspective as well as the effectiveness of building management.
As Elena Jukova explained, it would be necessary to assign the sponsor to the role of the sponsor, which would increase the number of contractors and the budget costs on its content.
At the same time, contracting experts should have knowledge to assess the quality of the work carried out by certain organizations as well as their safety.
Often in such a breakdown, it will be necessary to identify who will be responsible for the overall safety of the object.
In addition, this approach could lead to the withdrawal of high-qualified buyers due to the lack of interest in obtaining a public order for the full amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The Office of the Institute of Procurement Expert Advisory Centre, Alexander Evstaschenkov, is of the view that the procurement procedure is now being turned into a business game with the attention of the contractor.
An example was given: "the party shall indicate "specific indicators" without indicating "or equivalent", "must be", "to", "to", "to", "to be better", "to be less", "alog", "to", "type", "to be similar", "to be less", "to be less", "to be less", "to be more", "to be more than" and so on.
In this way, contractors often misuse their right to establish requirements for the submission of applications by certain organizations.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstaschenkov, was the need to further assess the quality of the application through the "bumous" proposal of the participant.
In considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor but not the quality of the work that has not yet been carried out, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be evaluated only when it is accepted.
The Expert Council was also invited to transfer the marginal income from the top to the bottom of the corner to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The President of the Expert Council, the Acting Secretary, FAS Secretary Andrey Carivovski believes that this should not be done as he is responsible for the order.
On the other hand, it will be found in the famous Recycling of Arkady Raykin "Athele": "What are the fugitives of the claim?"
Israeli children return to school after war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories, along with the Gaza Strip, returned to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines fell on their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip were closed while the territory was restored after the war.
The beginning of school activities brought joy and relief to the people of South Israel, but the results of military action were fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the Pashcho farm staff, where the rocket had been fired, picked up around the walls and children's holes before the disciples arrived.
"We're a little scared, but happy to see the future," said Ronit Bart, who lived in Kibuz Saad and an English teacher in his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a balanced life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Chani Bart, said that the second time she started going to school was "a little weird".
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Raven Riverlin visited a Cuban who was located near the Gaza border to express his support.
Prior to the end of the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not leave the street or leave their homes, moved to safer areas far from the Gaza Strip to escape the rocket and minute fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, living near the border with Gaza, where around the Palestinian mine killed a 4-year-old boy, are suspected of having to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that around the family circle had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at the time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyihou visited school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which he had worked hard from a Palestinian fire.
He gave advice to the children that he was learning. He said, "We are doing everything we can to give you knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to a lasting peace last Tuesday.
The cease-fire agreement immediately ended, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas ' request for the removal of the Egyptian Israeli blockade from Gaza and the opening of airports and maritime ports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put up arms and bring back the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new stage of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in the war, including three fourths of which were peaceful citizens, and at least 494 children were assessed by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contradicts these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were combatants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to confirm this claim.
The Israeli side lost 66 soldiers and six peacekeepers, including one Thai worker.
During the Hamas and other Gaza Strip operations, 4591 rockets and mines were fired by Israeli cities, especially in the southern part of the country.
The Israeli army then carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed in the Gaza Strip, and it is estimated that 250,000 people were displaced in more than 100 schools that were converted into prisons.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in prison, and the fighting continued, officials responsible for education delayed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that school will soon be open so that we can complete our education as children of all the world and Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohamed Amara, who is now living in one of the schools in Gaza.
According to the popular rate of immortality, the highest winter growth in seven years was observed.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing in Australia grew by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This growth has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price growth was 10.9 per cent, more than twice the increase in 12 months from August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed across the country.
Research Director RP Data Tim Lowelles reported that Sydney and Melbourne are operating on a double-level market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following market forces were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where average prices grew from five to six per cent.
At the second end of the scale was Canberra, where government costs were reduced by 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowelles said that, at the start of the spring, there would now be an increase in the number of real estate facilities on sale over the next few months, which would be "the present test" for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and current conditions with low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase in the next three months," he said.
How People Live in Uf's Oldest House
In the former house of goldsmiths and mountaineer Evdokima and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazakhstan) 18 rooms.
The 18th - century house has not changed in practice since its construction unless it is viewed as light.
Foreigners are going here as they travel, and residents suffer more than they like, from their privilege - the right to live in an old Ufim house, which is remembered by Colonel Alexander Sovarov.
The construction date of the house is incorrect, historians indicate on two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it is found that the building is not 300 years old.
Old court, always open door, screwing wood.
The doors in the room were close to each other, the walls were torn apart, and a street was seen in the light of the crowded sculpture.
Everything seems to be honest.
And the locals believe, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukayanov, a resident of the neighborhood of No. 3.
The facility is located in a cave, but its contents are not distributed for ten years, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still in trouble, but the foundation has gone down.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street, and they go to the public bathroom once a week.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road is directly below the windows, not even the walking area.
Daddy's taking a load.
Now it is evident that there was only a hearing: the flow of cars was under the windows.
Look, the glass is always moving, we can't open the window, but we're used to the sound.
But man is accustomed to good and evil.
Our apartment is still a model, thank your husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, we live the second with our son.
In other families, conditions are much worse, and at the second stage, there is a total of more than half a foot [a meter] high.
On the contrary, Tatyana invites you to visit a neighbor from the room No. 6 of the Old House.
A hospitable woman from the village offered a cup of coffee and said:
We have one room apartment, 14.5 m2 on four people, and we live: we have a husband and a daughter with a grandson.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been any other place,--Ludmila's eyes on the room: antresols, two marvels of "g"; one of them had a doll with a notebook.
The eye is very close and little different from the usual domestic interest: just a little beautiful, "historic".
But from now on, it's a regular stream: the water supply system is never going to work.
People talk about their apartment at the same time as Italian, whose home is in Roman ruins.
It is one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water treatment took about 40 years back during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in our kitchen and a toilet out of the former hall.
We live like the one where Demid and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, is it?
At the Uf's Inability Centre, the privacy is of no value.
We can't claim more than one room at all.
Four months ago we were promised to leave, but no further promises were made.
She didn't get used to complaining or I wouldn't.
In this room (room!) there was a whole dynasty: my grandmother and my grandmother, my mother and my dad, my husband and my daughter and my grandson.
It was all about that time.
For example, health - care centers fled through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flag, they're the metro.
They say the solution was mixed with eggs, so it's been stuck for so long.
The house is basically built, thanks to Demid.
That's probably why no one's been killed by a broken body or his own.
Only the building is just as slowly dying on our eyes: roofs and roofs are burning, fields are falling away from time to time, we're sinking into cement, but everything's useless - the solution goes down to the ground like ice cream.
They're talking, and there's, under our room's secret las and going to the White River, which people in particular did when they lived here so they could hide from the danger, in case of something.
They've been chased.
The Old Man tells us how a historian came to him, was able to let him start in the basement.
Then he persuaded them to give up their living room in exchange for their views on the October issue.
Human history has rejected:
Where are we in the uniform?
And here, there's a little hope that they'll give us more room.
We agreed to exchange, we wouldn't win anything.
In fact, the Old House didn't win anything.
The greatest dream of the people is to plant them, and girls with a 16-year-old grandson give them a separate room.
It was divided into two families instead of the largest ruins in which two generations are now living.
Sympathical, miniatural girl Olesse Karsakova from room No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There she lives in two close rooms, a total of 23 m2 called rooms, with a large family.
We're all seven people, two children.
See for yourself what conditions are.
The fabric is made of cubes, such as window frames, kitchen walls, and living quarters.
The water in the back of the year is only cold.
As we go through the rooms of Uf's oldest house, we can be sure that most of them are related to Lavrente's wives from the room No. 4.
They operate the most spaced rooms in the first phase.
You're right, place too much!
The room is 75 square meters. Three people are listed.
We live as once in the rooms where Survarov remained on the legend during his stay in Ufé, says family head Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrenteev.
It's so high, it's spacious.
One bad thing is all around the third floor, it's breaking down, it's falling apart.
Neighbors must have told us already!
Most of all the suffering we have with our fields: the trees have been cut down, the earth has literally flown out of its feet.
I've set up a backyard, a clinic; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, I'm walking like we're riding on horses, all the way out.
The house of purchaser Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievic can best tell any tour guide.
The gold industry is like a relative who speaks of him as being raised up.
In fact, the personality was inexhaustible: the owner of the Kagin and Uzjan factories built a house, fired guns and cholera, held the wheels.
The heirs of buying immortality are proud before, but they no longer want to live under a cross with history.
I've lived here as a child in the '40s," says Alexander Dmitrievic.
At that time there were wooden rooms for carts, canoes, and caravans, which were then cut down.
In 1968 they wanted to take our house away, but something went wrong...
The story was repeated in 2014: the new home was rethinked.
We, as a team, have collected all the documents, have closed the necessary instances, and the others have learned that the move to the apartment will take place in 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore.
Two years ago, Lavrentev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Baskorat to learn about the trial of the home.
The tenants didn't take it.
They sent from one table to another and then, as a smile, they pulled out a booklet without signature and printed: "The Ministry of Culture does not oppose housing".
I even felt that our home was not in the city for a long time, since it had begun to be under 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
Whatever it was in the '70s.
The Russian planet has been referred to the leading information and analysis sector of the Land Management Office of Vladimir Barabaş.
The house on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the White House Housing Programme.
I cannot answer for the actions of officials in the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan for all old houses at the time, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, but the decision of the modern authorities to restore all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, is successful.
Prisoners are soon planning to move to new quarters.
According to Barabaš, house Demidov will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in rebuilding the buildings in Venice.
The Architectural Biennale is now being held in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is being presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all old Old Kazan Street will be restored, the official says.
The house will acquire an appropriate type, corresponding to what it was three centuries ago.
The house of Demidov will soon become a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the Government level, a decision was taken to make a street on the day of departure.
Unfortunately, there will not be too much traffic in the city.
To expel people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promised in 2015.
Or do they remain content? Their new rooms will be the same area as they are now.
Only from another era.
A Forest Fire Begins in Homeland Because of Money
The dry cargo became a result of forest fires in the Ohotnic district of the Fireland region.
There is an increase in the number of forces and funds.
According to KGSBU "Primor Air Base" established on fire, conditions require that aviation forces be attracted.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Chief:
Fire, which occurred in a difficult position, has been detected by the aircraft observer from a patrol aircraft An-2 on 3 hectares.
Burns wood residues on an old fuel tank.
The area's strong appreciation and cross-section is more than 45 degrees, and the absence of fire-extinguishable detonators creates significant difficulties in heating.
We need Mi-8 helicopter.
It was very difficult to deliver forces available on Mi-2 and An-2 aircraft.
After fire detection at the wash site, 4 parachutists were suddenly raised.
The main task of experts is to fire up and prepare a platform for the supply of additional power and fuel.
In the area of lunch in the village of Ohotniči, 3 fire extinguishers are provided by helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter is ready to land in the fire zone, the experts will be transferred to the washroom, reported on the Homeland Administration website.
Lenny Henry: My father never noticed me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica, in Dawley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, Rudi's Rare Plastics, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in the Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of rhymes and rapa, and the tunes are life-threatening.
Henry, however, had to experience some difficult memories of his childhood.
After his mother died there was “a lot ” of treatment, and Henry often thought about his father’s relationship.
He was very unavailable.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice saying, "Prepare a smile.
Stay away from your sister.
Get out of here!
I want to see the cricket.
My older brothers Seymur and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a child, walked in with him into the pub and talked about things like the shape of a beer stove, the beauty of the crack.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an infamous guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently discovered a litany master at Dadley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to look at what his life should have been.
Now it's a bit better, but it's dark, breathy, deep labyrinths of the sun with fire and smoke and the dog.
My father went into the bathroom and he was just sitting there, and you heard him slowly start five about himself, because he wanted to get rid of his little master.
When I got there, I realized that he had done it years and years to earn us food, and I came to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry grew out of a child lacking parental love.
My father never woken up, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got really bad at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had never felt before.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop bothering me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I get along with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still excellent friends with Frank, whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I get friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fissures, and I also had to sit on a hard diet to get rid of symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's cute.
No one's dark.
The change of Henry's career trajectory may have been reflected in his noble, short-fledged fight.
Since he had received recognition of criticism of his Otello, he has been completely enthralled in the theater.
She followed the "Committee Error" and then "Forgets" August Wilson.
This work is different from the networks and comedians that were an inalienable attribute of his dedicated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Didier noticed how he was parading on the stage and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-70s: "I've been the only black horse/comman on television for a long time."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in public, I had to learn to be an effective tool for the delivery of toys between 1975 and 1985, as a star working on television, and that was very difficult.
Lenni in "New Persons" in 1975
As his manager had the right to the Black and White Show of Menstrels, I am facilitating a fun program in which people have "red their faces", Henry found out that it has been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I, of course, want it never to be with me, but I'm not sorry I did it.
Although this was a strange, worthy trial, I worked in large areas and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the prize of easy entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "the grotesque parody on black people".
In the presence of individuals who were also exposed to black culture in Britain and who were asleep, Henry worked in an alternative comedian project in the eighth century.
The first season of Shaw Lenni Henry was translucent in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chief Geret Blacklock from the Comedian series "Shelf!".
Advertisement roles, documentary films, televisions and movies took over the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What you're going to do next, Len, because it's only a few words that you're wasting time or getting into trouble."
There was a series of documentary transfers to Radio 4 called "What's Best in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had this allergy in Shakespeare.
I can't tell you that I've been taught so much at school, and I thought it was, in a lot of, the white people of the middle class who were with their balls and their hats down front.
So I was very afraid of him.
All we had to do was say, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, "You have to try.
Don't move it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry spent 20 drawings from the last Otello monologue for documental transmission and buried it.
I felt I could do it.
Whatever my head's been fixed.
"In this case, this is a serious case, with regard to this very serious matter, learn your text, conduct a small study.
So the repetition process was tough, and I read this song for months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
Of course, they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
We're about to start the "Committee of Error" soon.
I'm in the National Theatre immediately, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry felt strongly that his case was to please the public.
"Their voice inside said to me, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they make a computer."
Instead, the Assistant Director announced that the presentation would be repeated as soon as the problem was resolved.
I got off the stage and something said to me, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You're playing the song, stay in the role."
Henry in "Zabarah" in the Daches Theatre
It was difficult to study the text for the "Communication".
Panic is useful enough, it strengthens your muscles.
And they accepted it well, so it was like a sign above, showing "What you have to do with it."
He says that, of course, with a grammatical voice.
So I'll keep it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the reception room.
To be sure, Henry still has the idea of a comedy -- all the way to our speech, he's stuck in his mood when he starts to do it, he's gonna end up parading.
I've just decided not to work in the stand, because this piece of money is paid from a whole room of strangers, I think it's dangerous enough.
If you're always trying to do this, it could lead to a hole.
I sometimes work in the Apollo Direct Effer, whenever I want, but basically I don't get as much satisfaction as I used to.
I wonder if he'll ever get a standup tour again.
The pleasure of sitting in the room with the director, which helps to give the form of the beginning, the middle and the end of the way - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
Is that his new environment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You're always telling a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify "unexpected workers "
Kenya has begun the biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the Government ' s payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in a Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after they leave the public service.
President Wuhru Kenyaa promised to reduce corruption in public structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month is due to the payment of "invisible workers" and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be made to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanjema Chebusiri from Nairobi.
All public officials should be present in the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data are collected through a biometric registration procedure is reported in a Government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so for no honorable reason will be removed from the notice of payment.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the Government - thus ending the problem of "invisible workers", said Ann Waiguru, Secretary of the Office of Planning and Structure Ministers.
Tens of Turkish police are arrested for “salvation” against the Government
All 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "abeyance against the Government", reports local information agencies.
Police representatives did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 senior officers, reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had participated in corruption detection activities last December aimed at checking government officials, including four government ministers.
Several Turkish police were arrested in July on suspicion of the establishment of organized crime groups and the hearing of the telephone.
Turkish President Recep Taipe Erdogan (who at the time was Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cliché Féthoullas Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
In most of Ukraine schools opened their doors again on Monday (September 1st) after the summer cannibal.
This day is traditionally a major event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenj Yaczenuk took his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools were opened again but that he was doing everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The first September of the ceremony was not in every school.
There's no peace in every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peace of the heavens.
All Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian nation Front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pasteuchov, the school director in Slavianska, where Yacénjuka's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will benefit them in their future life.
On the first day of school, students usually notice that children are looking for high - quality clothes, holding aircharts in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impeccable leader she needs.
It is accompanied by a show of praise from the world of banking business, the management of media and the internal circle of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience of working at the lead posts.
Its career began in the global management consulting company Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, leaving behind when a high position in Pearson's head office was taken by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her salary is nearly £1 million.
Her political rating is also clear.
She recommended David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring experts from the private sector to Whitehall: she became the adviser to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband was former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May I called for the work of the vice president.
BBC is not only a large and complex organization in the heart of public life but also an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: within as the top level of the BBC's management hierarchy itself, but as a voice of public anxiety and anxiety when something goes wrong.
This is almost impossible, which requires full radical reform.
However, what a new president would risk coming, dispersing and destroying an institution as complex as China's dynasty if he himself lost his job in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
This would not be so difficult, and many people would be glad to see how BBC will decrease in size, after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitions erode the circle and new technologies push challenges to cheap old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular danger to BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 per year, Britain has a share of the world's largest media enterprise.
BBC tells a good story: it says that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and are 40 per cent per day for each of them.
Moreover, it is evident that the population of Beeb will grow: 53 per cent today support it against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
BBC models have changed: now I get new headlines on my mobile phone and I look at missing programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and powerful institution.
He needs a powerful president. I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says that the degrading tweet was written by some side.
A tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas of the Republic of Rika Perry on the night of the resurrection contained a disturbing picture of the prosecutor's district of democracy, who was at the centre of the criminal prosecution of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another of Perry's accounts, in which the record was discarded.
It was just from my account that a tweet was posted that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve this tweet, and I took it," reports a later entry.
The Assistants of Perry did not respond immediately to the communications requested to comment.
Although the records were loaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually involved in the publication in this tape.
Earlier on Twitter, the prosecutor of Trevis Rosemary Lemberg, who recognized that he was responsible for driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on the financing of her office when she refused to leave, which led to a high-speed trial in Austin this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate for the 2016 elections.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car as drunk, three times as high as the permitted level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for what he's talking to me about."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg community did not have an investigation with a major jury against Perry.
They were dealt with by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed judge of the Republic.
Perry did not recognize himself as guilty and called for political arrest.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment by stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who was carrying out his duties for the entire history of Texas was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding of $7.5 million from the state-owned State Control Division based on the Trevis district and was persecuted by corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to leave.
The Veto filed an official complaint by the public control team with a left-wing view.
The lens of Perry's confirmed account is often updated, and sometimes it becomes prominent.
On the fifth time he attended a party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry replied to the audience that he could get out of the game, posted a photo of himself running along the lake, and said, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal"
One of London's most well-known manufacturers warned that the real estate market in South-East England had "returned" to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was the subject of a live demand and a demanding growing price, with a wide range of fears that the loan will undermine the Bank of England in order to limit its mortgages in June.
Tony Piggley, founder and president of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal level of transactions since the 2013 peak," he added that this has provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market has succeeded in falling, as foreign buyers have gone to the capital.
The city's prices rose by 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Land Cadator, significantly increased the average rate of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices by private, accessible and student schemes grew by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the fund in recent months has made London less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been reimbursed by the introduction of new insolvency taxes and the political rhetoric around the potential “special tax” before the general elections in May.
The London Foxtons Real Estate Agency warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent terms of lending, would also lead to a reduction in market growth, both in the sale of real estate and in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England demonstrated a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, assuming further marketing of housing.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its price growth forecast to 3 per cent by 2015 on the basis of the trend towards real estate.
The amount of transactions fell at that time four times in comparison with the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to the WA Ellis agency.
However, the demand for a home in the capital proved very useful to Berkeley, raising sales of over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Piggly added: "The demand for the goods with a good design and a better location has remained primitive and, in view of this, sales have continued for a while."
In June the company reported that 3742 new houses were sold by the end of April, almost three times as high as in the 2007 crisis peak.
The annual income to pay taxes rose by 40 per cent over the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In his statement on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Piggly said that the expected revenue in this year would be in line with the current market expectations.
According to analysts, income is expected every year before tax is paid at £450 million.
The value of the shares in Berkeley was £23.96 on the second half of the day in London.
Photo by Jennifer Laurents posted online by hacker
Jennifer Laurence is attending the 85th anniversary of the American Film Academy Award.
The photo of the enchanted actress Jennifer Laurence, who received Oscar's award, was posted online by hacker, who is convinced that he has another 100 emerging stars.
The star's "Golden Games" representative confirmed that Laurence's photos are present and condemned the hacker for "hard entry into private space".
Treatment has taken place in law enforcement bodies and will be followed by anyone who publishes stolen photographs by Jennifer Laurents.
Photographs that were particularly posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were reportedly obtained due to the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "Catalogue" of victims of rape includes the names of women-changers, including Ryan, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photographs are true, although the Star of the Pilgrim Against All ” Winsted in Twitter has also condemned violence.
"The one who looks at the photos we made with the husband a few years ago, joining the house -- I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winston on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justin of the "iCarly" and "Victoria-winner" series said that on the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These are so-called photos of my FAILWIWI, people.
Let me stop it at birth.
Bizzfeed reported in the previous resurrection that the representative of the star's representative, Arian Grande, questioned what the photo she was supposed to be true.
The exclusive rejection of the new novel of Howard Jacobson on love and letter "J" caused criticism
They were divorced, and the best thing to say was that they gradually broke up like a cardboard box that they had left behind.
It was only at times that a woman told him that he was too serious, too heavy in the community, too tight, closed and, perhaps, somewhat embarrassing.
And then she took his hand.
He saw himself as an outcast.
He was an ass, yeah.
The last victim of this cycle was a small novel he expected more than usual to escape from one and another's fate and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomon was a very beautiful, hair-cracked and heart-broken man from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Robin.
She came to the south with a satellite of her older brother, who Kevin considered her aunts, and the last one was given a home in a raw, but look like a paradise valley under the happy name "Rayska Valley".
No one lived at home for years.
The pipes, in the bathrooms, were constantly sitting on the floor, leaving their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; now they are struck by snakes like giant shells.
It was like a catechism from a child book, but at the same time a scary and fascinating one with a full secret garden.
Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the 2014 Bucharest Prize long-list.
The short list will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen sit behind their hands, in broken shelves between the high grass, enjoying an unexpected warm spring day; they both sat down to the dormitory console that provided the country with soothing music and comforting news when looking at her baptized welfare feet, he recalled an old song of a long forgotten black performer who loved to hear his father leaving his daughter at home.
You have too many legs.
Because of their aggressiveness, such songs were no longer played at the consoles.
They were not forbidden, nor were they forbidden, nor were they allowed any more.
They helped them become archaeologists, just like the word "archical".
The public taste was what would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as people from the books chose the monuments of the rich, the poor, the culinary books and the love novels, they chose ballet from all the music.
As the day drew to a close, Kevin agreed to play on an imaginary forpiano and a rough comedy voice to sing the great legs of Alyn.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fats Waller," he said to her, mechanically attaching two fingers to the loss.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she landed off his loss.
It started with the games they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forget to apply two fingers to your neck, and that'll make you sad.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew he was waiting for it, here and there.
He had to explain that this is Jaz.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jaz didn't play, even though he wasn't banned.
The improvisation came from fashion.
There's only one "if" place in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end.
It's exactly the same with the ostronomy.
Its unpredictable effect on the people.
And Jaz was an island with music.
Although he was 10 years old and had never heard of Sammy Davis Mladschem, Kevin knew about jazz from his father's semisecret discs collection.
But even if he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, did she even remember the time when the popular singers were not black?
Again, no laws or pressure.
The community was obedient, and this meant that each segment of it had agreed with appreciation - thanks to those who had served the sentence - with the principle of group readiness.
People of African Caribbean origin by temperature and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sport - and they fled and fled.
The departures from India, as if of a nature talented in all electronics, have made it possible for no family to remain without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was technical work; what remained of the Greek was bricks.
Departors from the Persian Gulf and Lebanon, whose ancestors did not become determined to leave the country when what happened, if anything happened, were to occur, fearing that they would be blamed for the burning of the flame, afraid, speaking in their own words that the flame would devour their next ones, opened restaurants with thirst and the Chaldeans, would not rise up and touch them.
Every man with his abilities.
Just as she had heard only Ballads before, Elinen found it hard to understand how insulting words that only Chevern had missed her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really disgusting at all," said Kevin.
Of course, there may be people with big feet.
My father never disappointed anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the runaway garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could detect the noise of giant letters that were like cosmos.
Eileen didn't understand it at all.
How could your father love this?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to take two fingers back with her.
She already considered him strange.
"He said it was funny," he said instead.
She accidentally raised her head, shutting down Kevin's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that doesn't even explain why you're taking it.
It was said she was really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
The cargoes, maybe, hear-it-it-
And you're saying you hate me because my ships are too heavy?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"I like you because you've got a deep boat," he tried to say instead.
I've got such a twist.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to cheat often led him into a state of disrepute because, like his father, he did not receive a comforting warning that could alleviate the violence that he had been guilty of.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he too, Kevin, a hotel.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomon grew up and got up from the castle, dislodged the console, and poured out the wine they drank.
The wine from the pool, so the drink could not serve him as a justification.
In her womb she was said to be like a palm leaves in the urine.
"And I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
Although you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and for the extreme weakness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her mind when she gave him an answer.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the main drawings she was like a monster.
The same huge ice - skating ocean sank on both of them.
The same victims of so many men, even more sensitive and capricious after what has been done, if they have done so much more than their predecessors, smugglers and destroyers, they are ready to raise their hand against any woman who smiles at them or mocks them.
I'm gonna blow my head off?
If she wasn't careful, they'd show her the stupid doll!
At first, kisses are now the most common expression of erotic separation between men and women; opposition from the press balalades that gave the console started to kiss her and then hit her.
The best explanation, Keverna believes, is because he's kissed himself already was a hero.
Eileen Solomonz showed by his body that he had to leave.
He got up from the chair like a old man.
She felt the heavy burden of lead herself, but his anger surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She saw him go away, and from the top of the window she saw him go away, her satellite--a man who drew his own weight.
Adam, who left the garden, thought.
She felt the pain of seeing him and the men in general, even though some of them held their hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a twisted back, armed, armed, with all his ability to fight him - why did she say she knew it so well if she could not remember any case until today when she saw it?
Once again, Eileen Solomon looked at his feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or around Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher working in the Offnau, an informal office for the control of the public structure, prepared a small report on the maintenance of the low and medium levels of violence in the most parts of the country, where it was expected to be reduced if it did not stop, taking into account the resources and the forces that were allocated to it.
"Many have been done and much has been done," she wrote, "in order to alleviate the vicious aggression of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these puny flowers and narrow settlements, where, despite the money on the buildings of the church, the spirit of human kindness has often been felt throughout history.
Some qualities, however, appear to be inconceivable.
The higher the shield, the lower the stress it produces.
The population is falling down on sensitized balalades, is exasperated by stories of overcome obstacles, and has expressed its strong faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only does old-fashionedness preserve its strong hold in both rural and urban communities, but there is also evidence that new and evil attacks are born in homes, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said her science director, reading the report in cell.
I think you should read less novels.
We've lost Nósbaum's head.
I should also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I think it's not necessary to answer," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
We're back on our right to private life and privacy.
A feminist?
It's a second silence.
"I'm asking," said Luther Rabinovic, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any ideas here.
We are servants of society without any prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and self-appreciative, can sometimes produce results, such as what you showed me.
Obviously you're against the church yourself, and what you call "bad" and "bad", others would interpret as an expression of natural greed and energy.
To continue to offer TOM what has happened if it has been done at all, as if it had happened yesterday, means to lose the country of its own vital force.
We were looking at Nussbaum on the sides while Rabinovic spoke.
His head of pink, such as flame, repeated the advice Ofnau gave to the country in the last four or more centuries.
Get away from your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to ballasts, go to the music, talk on the phone, talk around, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking better than silence, singing better than written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," replied Esme Nussbaum quietly when she proved that her science director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we believe we are.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that have been made to the TOM that have been made, if at all.
Only this time will we let go of our anger and lack of confidence in others.
Luther Rabinovic joined the end of his fingers in the pyramid.
This violence must have meant endless suffering.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" actions that have or have not been done by our ancestors.
You're going too far and when you're talking about what they've thrown out their "heavy" and "untrusted" on "other".
In your place, people don't need to remember that, knowing the past, it's a protection now, we don't talk about "we" and "them".
There was no "we" and there was no "other"
It was a time of irregularity. That's all we know.
"For which, if you are honest with yourself," she dares to raise Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it's bad or good, what's done, it's done.
It was then.
We don't have to say anything else - we agree here.
And how no one should be blamed, nor should it be justified if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why did it go away if it wasn't for learning?
It's a past existence for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovic is broken.
"I'll review your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, along the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went out on a tractor, as described earlier, "in bad weather."
Contestants are happening.
The Army of Lesotho claims that the conversion has not been planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lésoto army challenged the fact that the coup was prepared to overthrow the Government, stating that they were acting against the police who were suspected of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that the country's army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family into neighboring South Africa, claiming that he was in danger of attempting his own life.
The military representative of Major Ntle Ntoi stated that there was no conversion in fact, but that the army responded to the threat of "political fanatics" whose police were trying to armed.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho has taken action by receiving a number of intelligence reports that among the police forces there are some elements that are really planning to arm certain political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to build chaos," he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Mongela, said that the actions of the military seemed like a revolution.
"Although no one has made claims for the acquisition of power, it is reported that the actions of the Armed Forces of Lesotho currently have major signs of conversion," he said.
The representatives of the Lesto Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks in the resurrection and that they had been safe in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is administered by the Government in the absence of Taban.
Taban stated that he believed that attacks were being made on efforts to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho was very tense since June when Tabane stopped parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in her joint Government.
He stated that his actions did not offend the Government, despite the accusation in return.
The Chelsea Conservative Marko van Ginkel will conduct the upcoming season of the right rent in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21st-year-old Dutch is coming to Italy in the near future for medical examination.
In the last season, he went to the field in the London club only three times.
Remember, Milan had previously hired a Liverpool attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at the lowest rate in 13 months
The increase in production in the euro area has slowed down to the lowest rate for 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the euro area industry by Markit fell to the score 50.7 in August, leaving 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were retained, and businesses suffered a growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The value reached the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will be expected from the bank of a clear plan on how to cope with the halting of the recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation in inflation of 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that ECB Director Mario Dragi could give further signals later this week that he is thinking of the quantification scheme for the euro area similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth, the devastating effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers will become more evident," said former economist Rob Dobson.
The German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of note 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest block economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause this concern as well as the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
Noting that the pulse of noise increases in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add credibility," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown of industry is likely to continue to bring oil into the fire by analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August survey of the business index of the euro area industry is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Effectors of the euro area are apparently living very hard at present, as the current growing geopolitical pressure - particularly related to Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increase in stress has evidently affected business, particularly consumer confidence, and is likely to result in some restrictions being suspended or even repealed, particularly major orders.
He said that "more and more is like that," that the ECB would eventually have to make some difference in the quantity of relief, "but we suspect it will be limited."
The people of Mariupola are showing a live fight against rapists
In Mariupole before last week everything was quiet - no one was able to organize the people's people's Republic of Maripol, the city on the Asian Sea and worked.
People are now looking forward to the arrival of the "policemen" now.
According to politicians, the separatists are breaking up into Mariupoli in order to go out to the Asian Sea - the city of Novozazovsk was recently taken, which has not yet been part of the self-proclaimed republic.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, but it had a little strength against the excellent armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and they were gathered to help the military.
They're carrying loads, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday evening, thousands of people came to the eastern edge of the city, and they stood there in the living room singing the Ukrainian hymn.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry supplies and products, collect medicines, issue newspapers.
In the city, shops are gradually closed and banks and ATMs are closed.
Ten years of age for survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the cold school, like the children who have been there, are still suffering.
Over a decade ago, more than 1,000 people were taken into custody by Chechen fighters at school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were killed during this three-day trial that affected the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied about death at school.
About ten years after the terrible arrest of the U.S. school, 334 people, including 186 children, had been warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When the terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it was said to some extent as much as possible.
The tragedy united the east and the west in a turning point, which then miraculously grew into action and hope for the future under the harshest conditions.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who lied about death at school.
We have found wonderful young people who have endured disaster, even though memories of a terrorist attack will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
What a war that is currently plagued by Ukraine, in which the same children as they die, are now ending.
A girl trying to take a picture back to the shooting sports hall
She was impressed by a picture of a famous Russian photographer Dmitria Belekov when she tried to take back to the bombed sports hall after mine was exploded.
In the distance, Aida desperately wanted her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run away from all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After the surgery schedule, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces remained in my knee.
Now her goal is to become a dentist, to help people like the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but she's definitely not broken it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and I can't change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone else.
My friend and I are trying not to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend who was supposed to be my only-class friend, Der Gappoeva was killed there.
We played together when they were small and thought we were going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I think about the family then.
She says that the arrest remains with her, although the memories are slightly different every year.
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our poverty, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and elsewhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I'm lying in a school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, know about our tragedy and do so that it doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who ran through the city of the pool thinks his mother's dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians started school at seven years of age), and he spent three days in prison, including his mother, Tamara.
Then there were seven of them, and he said, "My mother has told me that she will be shot and will hold her by her hand."
After one of the explosions he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying little boy on the road, grabbed the child by his hand and ran through the city of the pool.
His father, Vladimir, who took his son to court, said: "Damire told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with foot injuries, thinking that her son had died.
Then she said, "I cried out with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and woke me up.
Damira later arrived in London (now existing News of the World) where he was rewarded as the Child Protection Officer of the Fund of Bernardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Sherry.
"This fear comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Anyway, I can say that I remember him.
I'll remember how soon after that I fired all my toys.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports room, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing in the yard with who didn't choose.
We never say they're either killed or dead.
We're saying they're still in the sports room.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a gambling shop where I was allowed to pick everything I wanted and ride in a car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine where war leads to a mountain where he and his friends have survived.
This fear is coming back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who had been working volunteer work in a woman's monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve in the police sometimes, and I hope I'll be enrolled in the training course next year.
His 48-year-old mother, Tamara, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood. Can you imagine yourself?
I remember the yellow silence right after the arrest, just there were no children who would scream and run around, and that silence continued for months.
She'll clearly remember her trip with Damir in London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can support us.
She was grateful "Sherry Blair and her fund for the prize and the opportunity to go to London in August 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember how when Damir wanted to have a party, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the restaurant officials, Damir shot them out of his driving gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it's been a month after our nightmare then.
I was impressed that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world hasn't been better than these 10 years.
Now there's war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
It's just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people war is a news report that they hear when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know these people feel the fear of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed. People still want to kill each other, and it's so boring.
Dwarmer grew up and became a very soft and quiet boy, not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not riding on this last nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six single-class, and they're going to the sports room for a while and they're going to light up there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it. I remember how he stood on the couch and turned away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep. His eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw out all his weapons and other military toys.
It's hard for me to believe that for a few hours I've been so convinced that he died and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around when the parts of the body were everywhere.
I was absolutely convinced that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember calling him "Damir, run, run," but I was so sure he didn't listen to me.
But he heard and fled.
That is how life continues for us, in contrast with so many others.
Georgie Ilin, 17,
A boy whose shocking photo after the arrest became a victim of a tragedy in Beslan
Room: Survivor Beslan Georgi Illin with his mother Fatima after her arrest in 2004 and today's Georgian case
On his cover was a shock when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot him alone.
His photograph was one of the most shocking characters of war in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, in 54 C.E., took him to school on the first day of his studies before bringing his older son to Vladimir to university.
"I went down in two minutes before the terrorists came into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days in a nightmare," she recalled.
Not one of them, our relatives were there, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie was able to survive.
The closer that date comes, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some of these days' scenes are always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Falling into the soul: The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternally sculptured (right)
I remember how Georgie wanted to go to school that day, saying he wanted to know the teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's locked up in our bookstore.
I understand, but I also feel that because of this photograph, people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says: "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this breach of Boing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is going to be something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens because if I ask people, no one wants war, how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need ten years to forget her a little bit.
She affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it's getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I'm going to this sports hall every 1 September.
I want to give you a date to remember my old childhood friends.
I had a hard time getting into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I'm not trying to regret myself.
My life is going on.
I finished school this year and went to the University of Medicine in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to become a cardiosurgery surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the foot of a terrorist killer.
Amazing: Georgi Farniev was at the foot of a terrorist killer during the arrest, but he managed to survive.
At the time of the arrest, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a terrorist killer.
Actually, it's amazing that he wasn't killed.
"It seems to her that it was still yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to learn from the FBI intelligence officer, but could not because of the damage that had caused his health at the time of his arrest.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to deal with bad things, I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, I was the first and last time I went into this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with a photo on his notebook at the hospital after the arrest
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or discussing it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical status is concerned, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with a knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical findings, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second impression was animal, so I went to a veterinary institution.
I spent two years there.
He learns to treat all animals from cat to cow.
He said: I know that I will never tell my children of my experience.
That's not what children should know about, and of course it's not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
She must be even stronger for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgie's grown up now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept that when something is so terriblely unfair, it happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't handle it because of his knees.
He had several operations, he could go, but he can't do sports.
I'd say it's over 50 percent, but it's impossible to get over and forget it.
It's going to stay with us.
Many of my friends and neighbors were killed during the arrest, and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were my paths.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart is hurt for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to believe that life continues even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart got out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country right now, and I'm going to have a hard time believing it.
Have we been a friend in the past, as it turned out we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Aliona Ccaeva, 10 years old
A young man who was lured into a safe place by a professional fighter
Saved: Alyanu Ckaevu is in a safe place for the Russian Specialist (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the monster crime.
The world was shaken in 2004 when little Alyan was taken out of the school by a Russian police officer in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but they violently left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old Sister Christine and Brother Mahara in the sports school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Alyoni's mother and sister died in a fatal battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married since then, and they have a little daughter with his new wife, Light, whom he named Christian in his memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, now ten, doesn't remember anything about arrest and then grew up in a smart and healthy girl, is talking to her neighbors.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alona and Mahhar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the decade is observed.
You can understand why.
Lieutenant Sidzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United States to Borusia Dortmund, noted that he was impatient when he could go to the field again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy event in career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm gonna play "Borusia" again," says the Kagawa Picture.
I feel very good.
I'll be able to go to the field again in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to MMU from Borusia in 2012 to EUR 16 million.
However, he was unable to join the English club for two seasons of 38 matches in England's season, killing 6 cats and giving 8 results.
A man accused of visiting a girl on the walkway of Pelican in Faife
An 78-year-old man will appear before the court of accused of visiting a three-year-old girl on the Pelican crossing to Faife.
Gordon Stuart apparently got a girl to move to Pittenvin in East New York.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stuart had heard his Audi Q3 without due attention and received the girl, as a result of which she had been traumatized.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstruter, refused his trial in the sheriff's court, Dandy.
Sheriff Charles McNeyer, king's lawyer, appointed the court's date on January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland are not deported to Vladivostok.
The duty-free shop of Vladivostok Airport drew up a table banning the purchase of a number of world political leaders.
Don't open them with spirits, vodka and horses.
The magazine administration decided that President Barak Obama of the United States, Chancellor of FRG Angel Merkel, President of France France Oland, Vitaly Clicco, Julia Timoschenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known friends would not be able to open their store with vodka, horse and spirit.
And she brought out the relevant table at the door.
Previously, Obama had been denied access to less accessible facilities of the Dietic Tables of IGU, as reported by the public institutions website.
Whether an American dream president ever dares to eat at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban are clearly saying themselves to be extremely strict.
Is there a grain after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that new technologies should be developed in the context of the siege of the Russian farms in order to allow for the release of crop-type buyers.
The Council was given during the visit of the Yupticprom company Agrocomplex.
The head of the Government also advised restaurants to refocus on the Russian meat quality at the appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia on 7 August.
The main trainer of the Russian Federation, Valentin Maslakov, is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted training for meetings.
Our athletes spoke at their level, "You're sports" says Maslakova.
Thirdly, the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantages of the French and even the Americans are minimal.
We must take into account that we were not prepared for these meetings.
The season is over, and we haven't forced our leaders to join DecaNation.
In recent years we have become the second on this tournament, but in this season we have been up to date.
The French, on the other hand, have issued an army of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was announced on many occasions by the public.
But even this kind of trade union could not stand against the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken at such a representative company at a good level.
But in some ways the results were lower than the same Brilliant League.
The season is over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important as a result, so more in command-level contests.
The main place was here.
As a result, it was agreed that when men at 1500 m were so involved in tactical escape hits that they showed results below average... women's escapes.
4 guidance on improving the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film a video under water, you have a number of options.
The right-handest option is the waterproofing mill, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or X-Camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I made these photos on the family holiday using several cameras, all at a price of about $350.
Regardless of what equipment you use, a number of rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other offices are closed.
In addition, set up your camera for this type of picture or video you're going to take.
Some photo and video cameras have summaries or type of object that optimise exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you get into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can relax.
Some cameras are full of 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
See our guide for both traditional and waterproof models and digital cameras.
Take a few photos because many of them are missing.
There's a "snake" on the GCD that will help you make up your photos when they don't normally have X-ray cameras.
Even if you have a CCD, it will be difficult to look under the water, and the frame composition will be an accidental process.
So do a few people.
Also, if your camera has a serial circuit system that captures several individuals with a little different exposure facilities, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly lower than the depth of the water you breathe.
If possible, stay on the surface when you take it to the pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more colors on photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Swim closer to the objects of the summit.
It's a great council for drying, but it's even more important under water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you take the x-ray camera: This device is often fitted with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you need to get close to the summaries if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic bronze show on the fight against free Bilal Mahov can be turned into a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the Chief Trainer of the Dagestan Congregation for the Free Fight against Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of sportsmen in the Tashkent Peace Championship in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently at the "classic" team gathering, referring to "R-Sport" as Sajida Sajidov.
In fact, in both styles of speech, Bill made it up to young people.
At the early beginning of the world in 2005, he became the winner of the tournament of volunteers and a third example in Greek-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on the fight for freedom.
For a long time, discussions have been held that a new phase of our career will take place in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more: Mahov can already speak at the Tashkent World Championship if he wins a medal.
But the final word is always behind the training table in the head of Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality strength could meet all around him, even in a giant organization such as the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the rescue of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who turned to him, his wife recalled was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are involved in diagnosis and disease, those who are treated are primarily concerned about something else -- pain.
Once in 2007, however, he became one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel normal," he wrote last year.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
In the struggle with symptoms like flu, he discovered that he was slowly stopping his wife, Juliet.
"I want it to happen sooner than later," he noted.
When Juliet went into business every week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and extremely upset.
Something wasn't like that.
He asked his colleague to make a chest X-ray.
Every two weeks before, he slept on the beaches in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
It was a mezotelium, an incurable cancer that affects the lungs or the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to explain exactly why.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all of them have cancer.
But with the mesotel.
In almost every case, contact with a dedicated, waxy building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known as a deadly threat.
For most of us mezotelium is a disease that we can't focus on.
Asbesto, at the end of the day, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when he was used, only people from the specific industries worked closely with him, such as miners, builders, planners, and dock workers.
The industrial toxin from another era can hardly be seen as a cause for concern today.
But this is wrong.
Britain seems to be at the peak of mezotelium epidemics today.
This is where mezotelium kills more people than in any other country on the planet.
At the rate of death each year, some 2,500 people more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mezotelium since 1980 and projected number of deaths in the future in Great Britain
The reason we feel its fatal consequences now is that although the use of alcohol has been illegal for many years (all types of it have been, in the end, banned by law in 1999), mezoteliums are usually developed for decades.
And mezotelium attacks are not restricted by veterans of industrial construction.
The apartheid was, and in many cases it remains in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mezotelium does not pay attention to class, level of qualifications, profession or age.
Election pools, from fashionable London universities to private schools, did not seem to save.
Parliament's building has been deposed by speciality.
Even the hospitals that are intended to treat us have become the reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a thug.
In his own words, he had to think about where he could get in touch with the individual.
Then he made it.
"It's said there could be a lot of privacy in the tunnels in Gaya's hospital where I spent six years on the train," he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors, and truckers used these tunnels.
Interestingly, how many of my patients are infected with the same disease?
This was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in a hospital in Gaya and who later developed mesotelium in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one alive".
How many of us are affected by this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesotelium when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty per cent of patients die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
She's always dying.
So now we can only repeat the question, "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito of the United Kingdom, the lead expert on mezotelium in the United Kingdom is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the private epidemic in Great Britain is to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're going to die like this.

A quick review of reports from court rooms, where victims are often treated for compensation, shows how far the mesotelium attacks have spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer recognized that while not being examined, Janis Ellen contacted the specialist.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments on two facilities, one of which was the main magazine of Oxford Street.
Miss Ellen was 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children under 20 years of age.
"Until this happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesotelium, I barely knew about myself.
I couldn't even think it would affect me.
A few people really know a lot about themselves.
I mean, self-esteem is not one substance, it's a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "asbestyform", which means a volcanic structure that gives them stability and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotoll, widely known as white bees, is more often met in buildings today.
It was used in the blood vessels, the complete plate, the thermosolation of pipes, pipes, and even the brake brakes of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of identity, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is a useful substance (mozoth) and a deep substance (crokidolite).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of corrosive acid, and experts suggest that “there are large, although solid grounds to believe that this is the main cause of an extremely high number of mesotile diseases [in Great Britain]”.

Jennis Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical victim of mezotelomas, but Juliana Pito's work makes it possible to assume that her story is very unusual.
He conducted a study of patients who suggested that “a substantial percentage of mesotiles when there is no known impact on work or home have been most affected by the effects of the environment on the environment”.
Most of this effect, he says, is due to the “normal use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be confident that he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which was considered by the Westminster Court, shows how people, even in the very center of the Government, could be affected unwittingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shocks and noise waves following parliamentary committees were contaminated by a specialty that could lead to a movement that was as vulnerable as “strong airflows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be true.
Although the Department of Technical Services of Parliament had insisted that the Westminster Court had received a "clear health certificate" now it acknowledged that it was necessary to carry out a £1 billion on Parliament's reconstruction, improve electricity and remove stress, and that, following the 2015 general elections, the members of Parliament may be meeting at the QE2 conference near the Green House of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation was not governed by different rules".
It is not possible to determine whether this management error is going to last longer.
All you can do right now is wait.
One of those who was unable to find their contact with the individual was Graham Ebbett, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects he's been under the influence of an assailant when he worked in hospitals.
"I've worked in a hospital that has been successfully submitted to specific demands," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he will clearly remember is that day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late night.
Soon I began to suffer.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
Being a doctor, Ebbott knew that pain was coming from the lungs, surrounding the light.
Like Janice Ellen, however, he had no reason to suspect mezotel.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The doctors assigned the X-rays of the breast cell and put the pneumatic catheters in order to remove the fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
He gradually improved his health and returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had been involved in sports and heavy drinking.
In 2011, one of Ebbotta's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mezotelium.
Even then, however, Ebbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was ten years older and worked directly.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Ebbott ' s condition worsened again, and his doctor advised him to show the results of his CT and X-ray photos of the group of experts.
In December 2011, at least two years after Ebbott began to feel bad, a drummer equipped with a camera was introduced into the area between his chest cell's face and his face.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going further," he says.
I haven't had too much experience about it, I'm telling you.
But Rachel, my wife, survived.
The result of the biopsy came on Sunday between Birth and New Year's: "I was told it was mesotelium."
Graham Abbott: mezotelium
Abbott immediately started a meeting with nurse Macmillan, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It appears that the apses were widely used, especially in large public buildings, where private thermosization was often enough on pipes,” he says.
People who have been affected by these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, the mezotelium is now affecting more young people than ever before.
The most dangerous isolated tumors in hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would suffer.
But many of the staff who have walked through tunnels to escape from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eat in two tables (as Graham Abbott did often) have almost effectively been affected by the toxic substance.
In a few decades after the war, it appears that hospitals were where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients but were a place that posed a threat to the lives of doctors who treated them.
He's still getting away today.
Schoolchildren set up their bunzen fuels on private floors
And it's not just hospitals.
It was often used in offices, shops, libraries and museums because of its miraculous insulation and fire.
Schools too.
In my own words, many, most of all, were first influenced by the class.
All over the country, over numerous chemical studies, schoolchildren have set up their bunzen fuels on private floors.
Web sites focusing on the problem of homelessness in schools have appeared.
At that time, in our homes, such things as a complete plate or scarves usually contained privacy.
"It's an industrial nude planted in a large number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lausson in the case against the Gaya hospital.
In one case, the only contact that could be remembered by a sick woman was the harvest of wheat in the 1970s.
So be careful, then, with your garden fields.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that the disease is not treatable is enormous.
"It takes a lot of time to get to know this," said Graham Ebbett.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I spent two weeks in surgery.
Then I realized I had to go and talk to myself.
Well, I won't meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As a number of patients before him, he will remember how much information had to be taken.
"It was hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor "How much time do I have?"
He gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I don't see Christmas anymore.
Here's everything."
Mezotelium is particularly dangerous, as is the mechanism of how we sustain life -- just the act of breathing -- causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mezoteliums are caused by personal contact.
Asbestus is made up of tiny woolen.
When the axieties are destroyed and the waves are lifted, they can be stuck in the lungs, the lungs, the lungs, and the lungs.
The tissues of the individual reflect the lungs and may cause mutations in the cells.
"The problem is due to the breathing of the eggs of the human being," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiotic surgeon who arrived in the Gaya hospital in 2001.
That is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected it had an impact on the privacy, now, on the irony of the trial, the mesotelium treatment center.
The nurse knew about Louise and was able to treat some others who were likely affected by the hospital.
When the needles of the individual fall into the dark of light, Treger says, "The breath of the eye pours them out into the periphery where the eye is.
It's actually an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual options for treating other forms of cancer are much less effective in mezotelium.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, raises heated arguments.
Some say it should be tried.
Trager doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut your hair," he says.
There's no way around it with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very well administered by chemotherapy", which "acts", but does not cure.
"From time to time there are sick people who live long," says Treger.
But in the end, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live very, very longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gold died 20 years after the diagnosis was given.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Ebbett continues to fight.
After he had suffered from mesothelial disease, Ebbotta met Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis was ordered, became the sole support and advice office for the same patients.
"Hello, the Central Rock," he said livelyly when they called.
"He was very positive," says Ebbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Ebbot was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his life for a month.
"I was disappointed," he says.
I wanted to marry you.
Lusson, however, "he's been trying to give everything a bit more positive."
After meeting several specialists, Ebbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdonski, professor of Torakal surgery at Gaya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
A medium-sized patient should be given funding direction and approval.
Money plays a vital role for patients with mesothelial to get better treatment.
However, when such treatment eventually becomes ineffective, many sufferers face another financial cause of anxiety about the future of their families.
And then they are brought before the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known that obesity has been health-related since 1898,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became understandable that even very small quantities could risk health.
That's when they talked about the misinformedness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually resolved the case, but it was not "full-value settlement", Morgan said, since Lawson could not prove to himself that his mesotelium was the result of contact with the specialist in Gaya's hospital.
After his death investigation, the representative of Gaya's hospital confirmed, however, that "the concentration of double rooms where the matter was discussed was removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Self - Sacrificing
In itself, contact with a company or place of work, usually over a decade later, has been a major problem for patients with mesothelial who require compensation.
Many of their former employers changed the owner or closed it.
Fearful archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from want know that they have no time for it.
In response to this year, serious new legislation has emerged that makes it easier to obtain compensation, even if their former employers cannot be monitored.
Pursuant to this law, £350 million was established for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who would not be judged.
In such cases, they will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court would normally consider in the case of compensation - about £120000.
About 300 successful claims for this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many people working with mesothellium patients, believes that £350 million is "a good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by insurance policyholders," he said, with the aim of putting the amount in place of a fourth of what insurance policy would have to be paid if there were no time-consuming and mesothelioma patients could track companies and search the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that there was a need for rapid action when seven people die each day.
"People suffer so much and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill on mesotelium last December.
By then Graham Ebbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Langz-Lazdonski for 19 months.
Following initial consultations, Lange Lazdonski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy -- a tritherapy in which Lange Lazdonski could be praised as a total of 40 per cent of those who survived five years of illness.
Ebbott felt a lot of power.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Ebbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some force that supports you.
When you give up, your condition may get worse.
Graham Ebbott was in surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he finished his last six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans did not show any evidence of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
It was a couple of five in my chest cell.
I should've done 50 times.
It's not life-threatening.
It's the end of life.
And again, Ebbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of it.
However, this process was both physical and emotional.
You can think about practical things -- about finance when I die, for example, or about how a woman needs to show how timer works.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
You need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It was hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I wouldn't live until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Themsin is very community and energy.
She told all her friends, and they called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't talk much.
Such words are something that all of us need to face with painful cancer.
However, such discussions are not equal to hope or even to the possibility of survival for those who are ill with mesothelial.
This disease is a dark condition (even as it eventually is for Steven Jay Golde).
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezotelium is not a life-threatening threat.
The bodies of the oppressed Pharaohs are trapped in private tents.
The lens is used to strengthen the cartridge and increase the temperature.
The oldest mountain describes itself.
Now it's gone crazy and it's not going to rain.
I've seen some of it made of it.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy where it is used for making books (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large private chat rooms are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's an ideal heater for steam engines and turbines of industrial revolution.
The world industry will grow to more than 30,000 tons per year.
The statistics from Prudential identify premature death among those who work with the individual and who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook points out that parts of the assailant in her simple "was, without any doubt, the main cause of death".
It's the first case of this type.
The owners of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not recognize responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During World War II, construction was intensively developed, one of the most dangerous professions in terms of contact with the individual.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of deep-sea
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health claim caused by the contact with a specialist in Britain.
The world production of asbestos increases by over 4213 000 tons per year.
Great Britain imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Great Britain requires that all special contractors be licensed.
Imports and use of deep and useful substance are prohibited by the United Kingdom Act.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The act on mezotelium was adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Albesis is banned in more than 50 countries, but white bees are still used in expensive construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is approximately 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protestors swear to reject
The Chinese Parliament decided in its resolution not to allow the Hong Kong voters to vote in 2017 despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move will soon start with long- promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilization in the hours following this statement.
The decision of the General Assembly of People ' s Representatives, in fact, allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It did not lie to our expectations, but it still makes sense," said legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the Hong Kong people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Protecting China ' s decision, Li Fay, Under-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the People ' s Assembly of the People ' s Assembly, said that allowing the international movement to elect the leader of Hong Kong would be too “haotically”.
Since 1997, when Britain transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to vote by voting on the head of the Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision in the wake as a democratic step forward, as it gave Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; but the decision also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Committee on the Movement of Enforced candidates from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was taken after a year when one of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong had been held for many years.
For most of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace is threatened by the organizers of the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On the night of the resurrection, just a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central parties were gathered in front of the Hong Kong headquarters.
The organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would be subjected to wave protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not report any details, obviously trying to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement " considered the possibility of the central area being seized only as an exceptional measure, which could only be taken if all the possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We are very sorry that, today, all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the central area will undoubtedly be occupied.
Public authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing Declaration for a few days, and security measures have been stepped up at the Government headquarters with police and baricade.
Many people in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The flow of mother-to-child residents strengthens competition in the field of goods and services.
Fear is also reinforced that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the movement of the Occupy Central, saying that its demonstrations pose a risk to business as a source of life in Hong Kong.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want there to be any concern about Hong Kong coming out of control.
This is a presentation that is valuable for investment.
The Chinese government media also reported on the last days when Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists were shown by various Western countries.
This year activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 78,000 participants to more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American culture of out-of-balls comes to university life: first-class bids to get on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to such a question, starting the first "Lux" travel service in Britain for current students.
In order to leave a clear impression on university arrival, the company also offers transport options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their things across the country into a dangerously loaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for VIF, we are not waiting to help students this year to get to the university with the minimum effort and the maximum growth.
The representative of the company reported that since the service had only been launched, orders had not yet been issued, but added that "the students will begin to order this service within the next few weeks".
The company also stated that although students had to pay for £9000 a year, she hoped to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hope: more important than ever, they have a great first impression, and VIF is what it needs.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students has criticised this service as a fact-based.
Megan Dann, vice-president of the NSS on higher education, said: "The project seems to be an incredible experience for most students.
Many students who start university training this month face a crisis of life when available financial support in the form of loans and loans is not able to meet the growing cost of basic needs until they can begin to think at all about spending thousands of dollars on something of a simple income in society.
Feminists raise the issue of racial identity and police behaviour after Ferguson
The armed youth was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
The people who come will raise their hands, and they will say, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they are waiting in front of the graves.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noted a trend in Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments placed genders above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the focus on the Middle West grew and the national attention was drawn, Peres saw the responses of white women, who concentrated on 100 per cent of racial identity.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal sexes such as “the thought of Ferguson from a white woman” and “Feninism – not only about women’s abuse” appeared relatively late.
But for Peres they showed a significant move.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people talking about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so related to racial identity that they feel that they need to point it out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio, Coritie Mitchell Ferguson has faced problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not understood as "female problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 leagues everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how color people are being attacked in their own country, the silence sounds.
"Why are women safe to talk about relations, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who studied racial, gender and sex issues in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly distinguish these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now joining racial and gender issues in feminist mestria, Angela Hetter, professor of female and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done the opposite.
“At least 10,000 black men were lined between 1865 and 1890, and on this basis, the rape of a white woman was almost always carried out,” Hetter said.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm a statement to justify the licensing.
From the point of view of Hetter, a gap between white and black women occurred when white suspects, for example, Susan B. Antony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and found that the fight against electoral rights would be effective only for one group: women or black people.
"They decided to put all eggs in the basket of the right of vote for women, and the right of vote for black people was to appear later," Hetter said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear indication of why black women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to join the South Women's Association for the Prevention of Linguistics.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson, the conduct of the police, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white feminists had to "confirm" the problems that black women had faced in several generations.
“Right, it would be great if activists with such [traditional feminist] ideology were to take seriously the right to bring the child back to life, as they do with the right to a contraction?” asked Mitchell.
The feminists of the second wave, who have made careers in the fight against reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
A well-known feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, used Facebook and published a rare article by Collegiate Guardian Rebecca Caroll that required white Americans to take more part in protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the risk involved in the body - and points of view of racial problems that are fundamentally different in public questions - will be at the head of change," Stephen wrote.
Although Stephen is regarded as a more disruptive feminist, which includes himself and the problems of racial identity, and the gender, its comments on race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Institute of Enterprise, Cristina Summers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially young people, are "more vulnerable than their sisters", but the Stinmarks on Ferguson objected to the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch out for my brother" to help vulnerable black and speech - speaking youths, it was followed by an angry reaction by many feminists, including Gloria Stinam.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the noble line of traditional feminism.
After the United States border service arrested about 63,000 minors without being escorted to the country's south-west border this year, immigration reform was once again on the surface - this time as a problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to address this problem as important to women, she had to share the stories of women immigrants.
"They're talking about themselves," said Mercado.
When the majority of forced labour visas are issued to [immigrants], women who come with them are in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find an answer in women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich House "with Dogs" is being sold
The photo of the house on sale in Safffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was shown to have a large pig that breathes in the guest.
For sale of £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is on its private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was different from the picture of a guest's home, where a pig with a head hanging on the floor was depicted.
The Connells Immigration Agency reported that the pig on the photograph is a pet pet owner.
"However, the photograph was misplaced and already removed," the company representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former congregation home as “a unique separate house with one bedroom”.
Despite the fact that the agency took a photo from its website, it is still in advertising.
The sale of a home caused interest in social networks where some asked whether pigs were sold together with the home.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapov, in the fourth round of the US Open, thinks that she is not in a position to be stable.
According to the sportsman, she wanted to finish the year and try to get out of New York, OSIPOV transferred her to New York.
How do you generally assess your results on the Big Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad you managed to win Rolan Garros.
As far as three other tournaments were concerned, I did not find stability, especially in the conclusions of some contestants.
Now I'm finally upset.
She couldn't even get to the fourth terminal.
What are your priorities before the end of the season?
After my second stroke, I have a great motivation to go out to a new level.
I'm about to work, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian tournament series has already begun in a few weeks.
A member of the Gosdoma Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth, former World Championship Nicolai Valuev, proposed that GTOs should be paid when driving.
According to him, in general, regulations will be the same as in the time of the Council - people will make rules on support, escape and other exercises.
It is recalled that 12 Russian actors will start implementing the GTO rules from 1 September in their territory.
I also suggested to schoolchildren who were assigned to the GTO to pay bonuses when they arrived in the train, Valuev noted.
For example, they can be added a little more to the EGE.
It is also proposed to provide additional outsourced staff of enterprises that have passed the sport test.
A new millionaire appeared in Harvey City, South Wales, after winning the lottery
A game in a ball game from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is sought in the southwestern part of Perth, where one participant will pick up nearly $1.1 million on Saturday night with a lottery player.
The newspaper cheese in Harvey brings gold at the top prize for the second time in five years, the last one million dollars in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement about himself.
The hunter's owner Steve Forvard said that the game caused an old man in a small town southwestern from Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everything's very free.
We thought this could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia have won the main prize in the past month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for the State's games.
Last week, a game from Kenning Well became one of five millionaires in August, after a huge $7.5 million winning pair from Belmont just a few weeks ago.
The winning pair has been playing for 20 years and has reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel in peace and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey has won a major prize in Western Australia up to 59 this year, with a total winning of $85 million.
Ministration wants to speed up the growth of the electricity market
In this week, Minéconomravita introduced an integrated environmental clean transport development plan to the Government in Russia, told the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry of the Interior of the Ministry of Staff on the round table, which was held in the Moscow Autosalon-2014.
The plan is based on the Government ' s mandate, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted by the end of September - early October - the proposed measures relating to electromobilities and hybrids - will be adopted.
The plan (copy is in "Vedmostos") was calculated from 2014 to 2017.
The assessment criteria for electricity and hybrid transport should be developed and decided how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The Government's report, which describes the tax and customs support measures, will be prepared by December 2014; the credit and licensing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, to stimulate location and to establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it was proposed to amend legislation to facilitate the construction of complex infrastructure (in parks, self-construction stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials are intended to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally clean transport in the form of benefits in transport and parking; for example, by February 2016 and proposals for increased purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Minoronomic Development will include a list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities which reflect the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally sound transport and the development of complex infrastructure.
The electricity market in Russia has been only formed - around 100 cars were sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, an electronic import consignment was renewed and sales of approximately 500 bags were made, as predicted by the Chief Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Andrey Pankov, Russia.
However, the five-fold increase does not make any significant. In 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is imported to Russia.
Initiating the import of Renault, the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Renault's Director for Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Remus, Russia.
Most of the other electric transport producers, however, were in favour of Russia.
The development of electric cars is also in Russian producers " " ", GAZA " " " " " " " but the release is painful.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-Holdinga, AutoVAZ issued 30 cars.
A low demand for electric vehicles, the Director of AutoVAZA on Engineering Sergey Ammanov, will not be able to break this segment without support.
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to road vehicles (the electronics sold in Russia, in the middle of two internal combustion engines) is hampering the development of a complex infrastructure (the unit unit), inspired by Sergei Cilikov, the Autostata generator.
Due to the expensive and low rates of loss of self-esteem in the coming 3-4 years, the low segment of the Russian market remains low, predicting the main editor of the author, Michael Travelski, and the Celtics agree with him.
Automakers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already near the standard value.
In the Russian electricity market, there are good prospects, mainly for consumers to be convinced that "electromobility" is real; in particular, it will contribute to the emergence of all new power stations, the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlime.
Such infrastructure projects, for example, are being carried out by Rosseti: several stations are being built in Moscow, and about 80 are soon to appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a project network are also being held with other regions.
According to the Director of the Department of Plants, Vladimir Sofina, the company is confident in the electricity market and is ready to set up international auctions, but there are also problems: a small number of motor vehicles in the country and the absence of a single standard for the hire of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, has no right to sell electricity, it is possible to do so with regard to the order of electricity.
Pankov considers the most effective measure to support the creation of an electronic vehicle market in Russia for the cancellation of customs consignments.
The zero rate will continue until the end of 2014, with the possibility of extending it, extending the benefit list.
The exchange of transport taxes on environmental (the idea being discussed and related to all cars) also supports the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences that Pankov believes.
In Russia, the transport tax is small, Pankov says, unlike Norway, where the tax reduction has resulted in a rapid increase in the sales of cars - 12 per cent of them are now on the market.
In Russia, there is a need and incentive for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as they have done in Moscow), assured Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars in certain areas that are not yet available in Russia.

In Donbass Bay, along with many of his friends, Alexei came to volunteer because in Ukrainian news they told of animals that had been doing south-east separatists.
This is where Alexey saw another picture.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
Another called me, told me that there was a minor explosion, that most of all these Ukrainian armed forces were talking about one of the soldiers, Alexei.
Then I wanted to get out of the bathroom.
They didn't get us out of Ilovia, they told us we were in the boat.
I've already agreed with the commander. I've already written a report on the case.
The congregation with Zurakhov was immediately contacted by Ilowisk.

Economic News — Is Kiev worth $140 million lost?
The head of "Rosnefti" Igor Sechin stated that the company assessed the damage caused by the Lissian NPZ shooting in Ukraine by $140 million.
That's what he told Spiegel.
"We appreciate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government on compensation payments," Sechin said.

The total strength of the Lisian NPC is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is able to issue the Euro-4 fuel standard, as well as the Euro-5 disfuelled parts.

Ruble falls on the ground of geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Round, there was an increase of $33 to 37.15 rubles. The ruble dropped to the bivalve root on the ground of geopolitical tension.
ETS trades at $37,11-37,2 rub./$1, averaged in two minutes at $37,16 rub./$1, is at 4 copies above the previous closing level.
The euro rate was 48.79 euros per euro, at 3 copies above the previous closing level.

The United States dollar is traded for 23 copies of the official course, the euro for 16 copies of the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline on Friday, 29 August, but this time panic was not observed.
He continued his tenure and rubles and even updated his historic maximum to the dollar.
Investors are already in the process of undermining the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions for Russia.
However, as long as it looks more like an art ester, I break through the media, especially Western ones.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the IMF are not so much.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Round, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the bivalve root.
The geopolitical fund remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, the Russian indexes and national currency positions can be corrected.
Orenburg planes will be judged by Ideal Tour.
The Orenburg Air Force has provided Ideal Turu with a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
This is the case in two cases, which will be held in October.
The case will be handled by different judges.

The airline manager Victor Zukin is talking about an amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
The Director of Aerofleets, Vitaly Savreev, calls more than two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service has changed the user registration process so that new participants can be actively involved with the platform faster.
This measure should reduce the number of people consumed by their microblogging.
Now the new Twitter users will look at a large number of the account services recommended by the account service to quickly form their reading range.
The recommendations are based on those of interest registration.
Twitter automatically sets the key to the signature for all automatically selected accounts.
For this reason, the user has to take his own pictures so that he does not read those who are not interested in them.
If previously users of microblog services had seen only the recommended users' authors, Twitter is now taking a picture of one of the popular blogger's tweets to help produce human impressions.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on service modernisation.
Such activity is primarily linked to continuing service efforts to achieve immortality.
In 2014, the microblogging service was confronted with slowing down the user base and declining reader activity.
The company is currently desperately in need of a large number of consumer loyal resources that would last a while.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a pleasant and refreshing day.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy throughout the day, reporting meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow is 16 to 18 degrees, in the Netherlands 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather is clear, there will be a downpour, and the east wind will be weak enough - 3-8 metres per second.
The car maintenance programme was resumed from 1 September
As of 1 September, an automobile maintenance programme was resumed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the RF Min Promtor Dennis Manturov explained, money is allocated from the limits already brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by redistribution from other areas of support.
The programme covers all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation shall be between 40,000 and 350,000 roubles per vehicle.
A similar car use programme had already been implemented in Russia.
The main difference between the current project, the Minister explained that it is now expected not only to use machines to obtain a follow-up discount, but also if the car has reached the age of six, it is possible to obtain a new discount with an old one in three-in-in at the dealer's disposal.
Over 16 billion rubles have been lost in the previous federal tenure programme from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the production of light-duty vehicles in 2010 accounted for 1.2 million tyres (a plus 101.4 per cent for 2009).
The Creator Coming Out Simulator will issue a game about current journalism
The chemist Nikki Kees, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game on modern journalism.
He talked about his project at the Kill Screen interview.
Casey started working on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact was well - known only now.
The source of inspiration for the game became events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after the police killed an unarmed black youth.
In the focus of the project, which has not yet been mentioned, it will be the impact of the information provided by history on its impact.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will have to take photos of the areas where police and population links occur.
Hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which affects the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protesters are gangs, the police will start to treat him better and leave him where the ordinary person can't go.
If he was to let the events unfold, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into massive rebellion.
The eyes of the game will need to be picked with the help of a hero’s Twitter, where new signatures will appear if the pictures presented there are popular.
Game hasn't been named yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Caes, however, published an image showing how events can change depending on how a photograph was made and processed about it.
In an interview with Kill Screen Casey, he explained that he had considered the concept of such a game long ago, but he wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect material for the game, the chemist realized that he was lacking in knowledge and skills to illuminate the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media were lighting events in Ferguson, he decided to play a game on the grounds of what happened.
Nikki Kaes is an independent developer who publishes browser games.
His most famous project became Coming Out Simulator, which went up in 2014.
This game, which discusses events from the biographies of Caesar itself, focuses on how bisexual adolescents are trying to talk about their relationships with homophobic parents.
Ghelethei is involved in the ongoing bloodbath in Ukraine
In response to a call for regular "ten thousand" victims, Ukraine's Defence Minister Valerie Geletei has been involved in the continuation of the bloody resistance, says the IDF communication.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statement made by the head of the Ukrainian military department Valerie Geletija, who declared that "the end of the terrorist liberation operation in eastern Ukraine" and the beginning of "The Great Civil War", which would include the number of tens of thousands.
The extent to which the head of the Ukrainian military department, published on its page in Facebook, is an object for the study of experts not in the field of war," says a report by the Russian diplomats.
They work hard to believe that such statements may belong to the Ministry of Defence of a Civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister for Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On informal channels, the Russian side has repeatedly threatened that they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us if they continue to oppose us.”
In this connection, he stated that the “Operation for the Liberation of East Ukraine” had been completed.
Hilton removed all the intimate images of the star and apologized.
Today, there are more than 60 stars in Hollywood.
The hackers broke primary passwords on iCloud (data store) in smartphones, after which their intimate photos appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
That's right. Not long ago.
Remember, the official representative of the "Golden Games" star, Jennifer Laurence, has already reported a lot of photos from her cell phone, and has also confirmed that all the photos that "see" on the Internet are real.
Through Hilton, the founder of a unique website, he apologized to Actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their photos, says The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do this.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm taking the open photos of Jennifer Laurence and Victoria Justin," wrote a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the images of the stars have already been posted on the Internet.
David Beckham went into the DTP hiding from the paper
David Beckham got into a motorcycle DTP, saving from paperwork.
It happened in Los Angeles at the Bolvare Sansset.
The British footballer was separated by the cutting and cutting of his right hand.

Tony Stuart was suffering from an accident back on track.
The return of Tony Stuart on the track has already ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlantic Motor Speedway race.
Stuart stepped into the wall a second time after his right front row broke to 172 rounds, ending his speech.
Stuart brought his car to the garage and then went up without talking to the reporters.
His commander, Chad Johnson, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now focused on the race in the next exits to Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to be a more successful attempt and a more successful finale for him," said Johnson.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race night after meeting with Kyle Bush, who needed to repair the right side of his car.
"I started today with a lot of hope to get to the finish," said Johnson, adding, "It just didn't happen."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuarta was loaded onto the evacuater, and the team was gathered and ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car broke down and killed another driver during a race on the northern coast of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the persecution.
He returned to work during a tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Mladshi, who went on a train to express Stuart's discontent during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
The decision on whether Stuart would be charged was not taken.
Three times the campaign was met with loud voices and applause when it was presented before the hall.
I started with the 12th position, Stuart Shell at the beginning of the race, coming to the fourth position.
Then to 122 rounds after the Bush restaurant.
The 18 machine came out of the tractors of 2 and went to Stuart, explaining both cars in the wall.
Stuart went on, but he stayed until the 21st position.
Sobocca and Vitorgan are smoking cigarettes with Zwansky in Odessa.
Xenja Sobcak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, where the television has not gone to communicate in their Instagram.
True, one photo was very impressed and disturbed by the couple’s worship.
Photo taken in Jväneck.
"To-morrow Michael Mihalach Jwancski Maxim explains that this is an integral:)) #dessa," he signed a photo of Xenya Sobtak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.

Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria have carried out a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the previous working conditions that had recently been changed.
The increase in the salary is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the temporary duties of the Minister of Justice of Christ John.
During the month, the officers expressed their symbolic protest against the new work schedule, calling for the previous 24-hour change.
Although the union of prison officials has repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the agreement has not been reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BND).
The negotiations continue, the BND informed the head of the Chief Executive for the implementation of the sentence of Rosen Jelazkov.
Members of the Federation of Professional Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are expected to join in protest against the union of prison officials.
Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prawt (right) appointed Minister for Defence of the Right of Wongswana (left)
The military commander and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan Ocha, announced the composition of a new office of Ministers of the country in which more than one third of the posts are held by the General or Generals.
Military representatives received key positions: defence ministers, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was officially approved as Prime Minister after the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government to this post by the King of Thailand.
The 60-year-old military who seized power in the country as a result of the free conversion of 22 May was the only candidate at the Prime Minister ' s post.
He was elected Prime Minister at Parliament's meeting.
The former army has appointed Members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Dach, the conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
It had continued demonstrations during which protestors had demanded the resignation of the Government of Prime Minister Yinglaq Chinawat.
Praut Chan Ocha will officially be a temporary prime minister, as the military are planning to hold a general election by the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their authority in the country.
Wars came to power on 22 May
On the basis of the full parallel of civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were under temporary arrest.
Shortly after the arrival of the military, they undertook a temporary arrest of the country ' s leading policies, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public actors were also detained.
The current political crisis is due to the roots in 2006, when the army settled as Prime Minister of Brother Yinglik Chinawat Taxi.
Both benefit from the popularity among rural people, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has not yet made them successful in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and capital elite came into the anti-government movement, which had practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that it would be better in the media hall, I didn't promise you that an officer from the new Palm Brasser will be fired.
It should be formally acknowledged that this is true, but reason and jealousy remain constant.
Because they've known for a long time, we've been saying "Belgia" -- we've got media -- we've been saying "Midia" -- we've been saying "Belgia."
Restaurants like to say in depth that success depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There's such places that they don't have to be good, but they're even great, but they don't carry anything.
Stepe, sitting behind Palm's table, I remembered that once there was a coffee of "Grodok" (in honour of the same telegram), then "Odessa-Mama", and another restaurant "God" and a beer company.
Now there's a beer here again, but no longer a non-natal-Soviet, but a Belgian.
There was only a peak of the iceberg above the ground: a barbar and a pair of chairs, all the rest of the area was left out of the sunlight.
That's why it's been fun here, like in the kid's room: red, green and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows -- TVs where girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the news, so compare it with what it is.
Here are eight different types of beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 l) and an countless butcher (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer gladly presented the menu, saying that "medias are thin large seeds", and should be noted: service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected to contain, but often very unexpected.
For example, it is expected that a ball roll with a woolen blackable (180 rubles) is actually a piece of paper, which is so thin that the permafrost compared to it shows the matter undisputedly heavy.
It's only possible to feel any taste, if you cut your pants together.
It's even worse with salads.
The classic bed (260) would be more likely to recognize the crime against the Belgian people: some kind of iceberg, once opened a long-lasting map, breaking the Kenyan fascism, pulled chips from the bacon plus some marinated rope.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a bed salad!
The composition of Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If there was still a chance of closing the eyes on the inadvertent fourths of the crevices or overcrowded shampoos, why would the media seem to have been able to tear them apart and open them several times in their lives!
Because I already know, there's a lot of regular belmore media here!
They are given in boxes "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
The juice of a semi-pound, which is made of white wine, wheat and pellets, is not covered with blood.
There's fruit, and there's no aroma, whether there's wine there or not, and there's still something left.
That's why good people rely on the media with domestic meonizing.
The cool water here is not a cold, wet to the extent that you can decide, first or second, before you, and just a nice slender.
It was said that the local dispute was prepared in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about it.
The situation was diametrically opposite to the surface: the moustache was all closed.
It was impressed that this crocodile had been fed with extremely fragrant shells, which had so many unusual aromas.
But then the crown was applied to the knife -- no, it's just a broken hole in a caramelized box.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also sweet, with meat, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The clown bear has become a superintendent, and the waffles are dry.
But when the manager arrived at the table, he was very unofficially interested in the impressions.
So it should come again.
The rate of $$ rose to more than 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia in the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar is calculated "to-morrow" at 10:29 msk rose to 26.9 copies and constituted 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose to 30 copies - up to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Bureau.
The bivalve root grew for 28 copies to the previous closing level and stood 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 rubles on 19 February 2009 and on 3 March 2014, it had already reached 37.005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barak Obama and German Chancellor Angel Merkel discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weight of the ruble is long-term, both in euro and in dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this note, says senior analyst Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will either be affected by the courses.
As long as this is going to continue, investors will react.
Today's hearings about the invasion of the army are not confirmed on the one hand, but the market has become very emotional.
All the discussions on his standing up to such news were reconvened yesterday.
The week, according to the expert's estimates, is around $36,90 and $37,05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, low oil prices, policies, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine are all just one step away.
The rate of inflation is also projected: current gas prices range from 5 to 10 per cent.
Soon, seasonal fruits and fruits will be completed and a vacuum will occur until the networks are refocused on other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the score in 37 rubles, passed it and came back with no strong butt," commented the head of the "Open Broker" section, Constantin Bushuev.
It will still be considered whether the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as will be held by NATO.
Ruble, he said, was very weak after the end of the tax season, then the news came to Ukraine, and the CB stated last week that by the end of the year, it had completely moved to the floating course and had refused any monetary intervention.
If you look at the daily billing, it's nothing different from the previous months of this month, all of them have been afraid of a score of 37 rubles.
And so there's nothing powerful about trade.
There were times of concern for the currency market when an increased demand for currency was noted at the end of January, as well as the third March when the ECB charged the recorded amount of money.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the rubella weakness.
First of all, this is an increase in income from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through import travel, says UFS IC Aleksey Kozlov.
Visits of import goods and services can be made at negative times.
The Russian currency fluctuations significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, resulting in inflation growth and resulting in money-laundering, which, in turn, contributes to the deterioration of the country ' s economy.
In terms of the share market, the valuation of the rubella is somewhat consistent with the decrease in the price of the shares expressed in the rubles.
For example, the IMF Index during the fourth quarter fell to 1.67 per cent and the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relatively low index size is due to a decrease in the ruble during the day more than 1.5 per cent.
The decrease in the ruble is emotional and is motivated by a massive desire to buy money.
As the practice shows, emotions gradually go away, and rubles partially or completely restore lost positions.
“We expect that we will soon be able to see the relationship between the dollar and the Russian currency near the $36 rubles for the dollar,” notes Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic abuse is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she was still alive for several years after having diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Mari-Tuta disease (SMT) as a group of inherited infections that cause nerve damage to the brain and the phone.
CMT UK reported that misdiagnosed diagnosis was a part of the problem among SMT people, as it was not known.
There are about 23,000 people in Britain, it is estimated, that there is a SMT that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walk and broken legs.
The sick may experience tiredness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from Fridrey (AF) attack -- a condition that was very bad for her.
Rogers thought she'd be stuck in a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30 years old.
The mother of two children, now 51, said: "I knew I couldn't do anything else.
I fell down every day, and I had more time for everything.
I've never been able to jump on the rollers or skateboards with other kids, and I have to get a lot out of school because I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release her helium conjugate and correct her feet, she looked into a medical card when her doctor took her out of the room, and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I had a nose that didn't fit, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote it to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was shocked and tested the most terrible panic as far as possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I'm done 25, and I'd gradually lose all my abilities at this interval.
I went through this one, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not diminished as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up and woke me up and said, "My dear, I don't think you've got this disease because you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that represents a lot less life-threatening threat.
After several genetic surveys, it found SMT.
"When he explained that such a SMT, I thought it had removed a happy ticket," she said.
The United Kingdom WMD has announced a month of information on WMD in order to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on enterprises in the Washington area is rising as the economy is restored
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country have increased significantly over the past year when economic recovery has been accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are not excluded.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totalled $27.6 billion in the state and local criminal system in 2013 to 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion collected for 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business over the past year has increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this has been the third year of growth following the fall in 2009 and 2010.
State-owned taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent more than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the study conducted by a company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax income in the area, 56 per cent, is taxable to entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of the income in Maryland is taxable to companies.
Origins, with 28 per cent, provide the minimum tax income, in proportion, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues caused by the return to the previous level of the company ' s real estate value, researchers say that tax on real estate increased by 3.7 per cent in this year after three years when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While most of these revenues are coming to large states, such as California, New York and Texas, the same appears to be true in the Washington area.
The companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $10 billion in state and local taxes over the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 -- an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.
However, the observed return to real estate does not have any similar effect on the increase in tax revenues by state and local level in Maryland, where tax on real estate is barely more than one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of state tax accounts and at local level in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that such a large part of their mobility, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs either to the Government or to an non-profit organization that does not pay the tax on real estate," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
In this way, Maryland has had to put more emphasis on income taxes in order to pay the same services in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be adjusted according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion to more than $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
While trends are one-way, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs is not increased at the same rate in all three locations.
The level of growth in Ocrug Colombia was at the same level as the country ' s average, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were observed below the average income of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which is equal to 6 per cent).
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the area it is about 9,975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes are lower for state- and local-level entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The area was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislative act reducing its corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the State continues to achieve tax revenue targets in the following year, this law could result in an income tax rate of up to 3 per cent for entrepreneurs by 2017.
At the same time, the small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pay more State and local taxes, according to a recent study.
The individual income tax paid by small business owners is a transitional structure in which most small companies in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia have increased by 20 per cent over the past year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate than the total taxes for entrepreneurs.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes across the country is likely to remain in this year, with State and local government taxes rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
The Washington area, however, may decline as federal spending is affected by the labour market in the region.
The Iron Age of the Russian Djudo
The home-home peace campaign on debt brought together two silver coins and seven bronze awards to Russia.
The Russians were the only ones who had the main interest in coercion — Japan’s collection.
The tournament in Chelabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought silver medals to the Russian team.
Its owner became Beslan Mudranov, a category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the same final struggle with Boldbaat Hanbat from Mongolia, the source of the opposition was the same comment received by the Russians.
And on the second day, the tournament became the most successful for Russia's assembly - three medals were held on Tuesday.
In male interviews, up to 66 kg of serebro reached Mikhail Pulaev and the bronze of Kamal Han Magomed.
In the final one, the Russians joined the 2011 and 2013 World Championship in Japan, Massai Ebinume.
Han Magomedov, in the fourth phase of the missing compatriot, won the winning tournament and became the winner of the bronze prize.
In the female tournament of the category up to 52 kg, Natalya Kuzutin also received a third grade of fivepence.
In its semi-finals, it lost the current World Championship of Milane Kelmendi from Kosovo, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
Kuzutina won Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament, it was recognized that the third place was not what she was counting on.
And once again, the victory of the Russians to gold became Kelmendi, winning Custine earlier in the final European campaign.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelabinske, Moses Moguškov, who fought in the category of 73 kg.
At its fourth round, its predecessor became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skowarzov, now speaking on the OAU team.
However, the Russian won two matches and became the winner of the prize.
Moosekov spoke at a home-based golf course, which he plans to take care of in the near future, so he will take a break in the races.
As for ex-mudvanin Skwarzov, he and he were on this tournament before the bronze medal.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko, another associate who accepted the OAE's sports citizenship, concluded a speech in the category of up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day of CM-2014, the Russians also brought one bronze of up to 81 kg to Ivan Nifontos.
In a heavy fight against the small final, he won the French Alan Schmitt because of his comments to the opposition.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were held, but the traditional Russians were limited to one bronze in a man's tournament of up to 90 kg.
Its owner became Kirill Questions, where the medal was guaranteed by the Russian Federation: its final competitor was Cyril Denissov.
However, there was no understanding: the questionnaire could not go to the camps because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was taken by farmers, and on the sixth day of interrogation, Renat Saidov placed it in a collection bag of over 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he won a clean victory over the Brazilian David Maurice.
Thus, the individual part of the world's empire ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, on the resurrection day, the names of the world's champions were played in command events.
Both Russian and male congregations and women were one of the main bidders for the prize, but, as in individual interviews, there was no connection between the representatives of the beautiful sexes until they reached the medal.
And this is where the Russian judos invaded the command-sebrage.
On the contrary, they have taken the lead in the fight against 2-3, the Japanese team.
At that time, the Russian Federation took 2-0 after the pure conquest of Han Magomodov and the left-hand Denis Yarceva (weight up to 73 kg).
However, they were unable to handle Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Cambiev (100).
The same scenario also developed a bronze match in a women's tournament where a Russian assembly, 2-0, joined Japan - 2-3.
At the command meetings in Chelabinsk, President Vladimir Putin was present, who welcomed a man's meeting with the silver at the end of the tournament.
"The second place is very respectable, but I mean, it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whose word is "News".
To play Japanese, cousins - there's nothing interesting here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian Federation at the World ' s Home Championship was much better than last year at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals -- one Serbian and two bronze.
Meanwhile, the current tournament was attended by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstan and Manshur Isaev.
We're all, of course, major Maximists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the most powerful in the eighth century, he is the potential winner of the Olympics.
There is more to sport than judo," said RF Minister Vitalia Mutko, who is the press service of the campaign.
Japan’s collection is expected to be the best in Chelhabinsk, with 11 medals of different value, five of which were gold.
The next World Championship will be held in Astana in the coming year.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
The Joan Rivers family hope for the best
Joan Rivers is unconscious from coming to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed the hope that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother came to Mount Sinai on Thursday after an emergency call for her heart failure at the hospital in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, reported sources.
Doctors are intent on keeping her under drug control and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “hard”.
The response was widespread, including numerous Internet support from such individuals as Donald Trap, Montele Williams and Kelly Ripa.
They're all capable of kings.
In the sale of a debate album by the Royal Blood group, a new hope for the British year, which took off the football club directly at the stadium.
Two Royal Blood every year on stage, but it already has an active nomination for the BBC musical prize, a tour of the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert from Jimmy Paja himself.
Their debate-named album was awarded 100 thousand prescriptions a few months before it was released, and the contract for its release is in the Major Library of Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current state of play in the music market, the situation from which it comes is not about the new Lane Del Ray or the regular sweetness of the new R'n'B, but about the two British players playing with this level of boredom and intensity that last time was in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album in respect of all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
Duet did not see himself as a name to which he had been able to find out that all the already disappointed goldsmiths were already disappointed, and the blood of which kings they seem to have in their homes is also understandable.
The thing is, of course, mainly about the heroes of the past Led Zeppelin: as with the great neighborhood, Royal Blood is intended to meet the blood of the British year, taking it to a new height.
To predict the success of this company until now, please, early but something can be said.
The Ten Songs, which took thirty minutes with a small minute, are not just a demonstration of phenomenal composition, but a strong declaration of intentions.
Some of the values of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: say, the pilot's "Out Of The Black" is of the character, not the melodic line, but the drum party.
The performers in the play say that this song is much easier to push than to push.
It is also possible to assign a powerful Little Monster and a closing plastic composition Better Strangers with a Czech quote in the title.
It is true, however, that each of these songs will sound great at the feast of lovers of the hard year, but when they are played, they fall into more or less the same sex.
And it's not necessarily bad, even on the other side.
The Royal Blood Force is not demanding new Lennon and McCartney's labs, but has removed numerous rock duits from the hetto Indian club.
Their music, in spite of some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a space of less than a few thousand people, apparently close to it.
The secret part of the quick use of the base replaced by the guitar in the usual format, which was introduced at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
On the contrary, it is not only in instruments but also in the way that music is composed.
Heroes of zeros with great effort were selected outside the post-modernistic paradigm, with great difficulty in recognizing themselves not simply as epigonists but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood now sounds so strong and stressed that it successfully draws some duality and strength of musical material.
Well, at the end of the day, who said the rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has only confirmed what information was reported on Friday morning: online stores - and video carriers, and hundreds of other items - buy the Twitch video production service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitter to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Google's Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination seemed natural.
Twitch, based all three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a current general service - YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where the gamblers transferred their domestic moments; "YouTube for a real-time game," according to Business Insider.
Switch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videomakers who give (mainly, old ones) processing like in the Secret Theatre, already popular on YouTube.
The fact that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch is so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been met with no particular interest, a classic example of a burning technology company that buys potential competitors.
It's a secret why the deal with YouTube has been broken, given that it is available that it was willing to pay at least as much as Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmet Shira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, honestly speaking, is the incredible success of Twitch.
The nature of me who claim to be better at sports than watching it is hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games rather than taking them into their own hands.
One case is to look through each other's shoulder on the 3th of the morning when she passes through the Resident Evil, and the other is to look at how some side man gets 20 shots on his head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are counted on one person, so looking at their summaries without controlling the angle of view alone can be a recipe for the headache of Do It Right.
I agree that the speedy transitions that Roger Bennister of our electronic age completes all the games in record time.
But if it's not about the virtuosity of the game or the mood, it's unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do schectics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, the fourth of which is the source of high-speed Internet traffic.
How does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn into the Amazon Instant Video just as clear as YouTube could just watch Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would like to have: the crowds of young men who dream of advertising.
As Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "they both believe in the future game", and this channel does not give clues even as a mature sport.
As a result, more than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in 2004.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
They spoke with survivors - almost all of the students, with the parents of the deceased, with the camper of the City of Angelov - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the "Mother Beslan" committee of Susan Dudie, who participated in the operation of the ICS staff, - told the correspondent of the section "People" of Elizabeth Antonova, working on the project.
On his return to Moscow, they met with Aslambe Aslahan, who had been the adviser to the President of North Caucasus and had negotiated with the terrorists, as well as with the head of the FSB of Russia's Váčeslav Bocharov.
What particularly impressed me during my work on this subject was that there were no decades in Beslan.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have something to do with it, people who are hard to agree on what happened.
The impressions of travel are very difficult.
But I can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonova.
The project was prepared by a study of the Photography of Holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and the 15-year residence of Governor Putin.
KNDR carried out the launch of small-scale rockets
North Korea launched a small-scale rocket in the Japanese seawater, reports Renhap.
The launch took place about 10.30 a.m. on a local time basis from the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
It is estimated that the rocket landed in the Japanese Sea, some 220 km, in the Joint Committee of Heads of South Korea.
Members proposed that the entry into force of the Staff Data Act be accelerated
In the event of the success of the initiative, Russians will not be able to keep data on foreign servers from 1 January 2015
A draft law on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Act on Personal Data of the Russians has been introduced to the House from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower room.
The authors were Mr. Vadim Dungin, Mr. Yaroslav Nilov (LDP), Mr. Fedrov ( "United Russia"), Mr. Vladimir Parahin ( "Justice Russia") and Mr. Alexander Yuttenko (KPRF).
Such a change, in the view of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to the more expeditious and effective provision of RF citizens ' rights to the preservation of personal data and to the confidentiality of the information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, in which Parliamentary troops are involved, requires the provision of personal data by Russians processed via the Internet in the territory of the RF.
It also makes mandatory records, systemization, collection, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data by RF citizens in the databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the Law confers upon Roscommnasor the right on the basis of the court ' s decision to limit access to information processed by the FF ' s personal data legislation.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called "blacklists" of criminal websites - an automated information system "Registration of personal data subjects' rights".
This Act was adopted by the Lord's Year.
The authors of the bill made statements by Andrey Lugovoy and Vadim Dingin from LDP and Alexander Yuttenko from CPRF.
Dingin and Yuttenko are also one of the authors of the current draft law on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Act that has been adopted.
Those with no data centres in the RF must be paid for rent
Commenting on the draft legislation that had been introduced to the House today, the first sentence of the thought committee on information policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see any problem in transferring the date of entry into force of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data.
According to him, companies that will not have their own personal data storage in the RF territory by 1 January 2015 will be able to hire them, for example, "In Rostelecoma", which has repeatedly stated that they are willing to provide their servers to rent and are already providing their servers to the Mail Group in Western companies that are now providing their servers."
“There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area”, he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work on the RF territory, I don't see problems - they will have technological opportunities to move," Levin said.
Arbitrary bill
Shortly after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed its fear that Russia would no longer be able to use many global Internet services if it had adopted the bill.
In particular, it concerns online aviation and services.
In the view of the association, "the bill deprives individuals of the right to distribute their own data impermissiblely, stating that their records, systemization, etc. should only be provided in databases located within the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user-information mechanism on where the record is being implemented, the systemization of its personal data.
In such a case, it would be possible to decide on which territory the action would be taken.
The adoption of such projects on the location of personal data in other countries has resulted in global services and substantial economic losses.
The ice-cream test participant pulled out
Isabell Roberts from Britain cried so much when ice water poured on her head that it damaged her bone structure.
It's a cold water test that didn't hurt.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried so much during a cold water test that she was so drunk.
Isabelle Roberts cried so bitterly when the ice water was pouring on her head that damaged the structure of the person.
"The water was so cold that I cried, but when I did it, my glory began to stop," she said The Mirror.
They fly for 20 years.
Isabelle Roberts for seconds until the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't shut up, he shot me, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister came to the same understanding and began to cry, but I had to get to the emergency office.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to perform post-populative surgery on Tuesday.

The prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian military for more than 400 planes
In the Army of New York, it claims that the Ukrainian Su-27 has been defeated and accuses the opposition of violating the ceasefire agreement.
On 1 September, 402 civilians were transferred to Ukraine, 72 of whom were wounded and 35 dead soldiers.
In this regard, Interfax was informed by the press representative of the "Armiya Novorossia".
He added that “the PWO forces in the area of the population of Mereška will destroy the Su-27 aircraft in violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the agency ' s coordinator, the Ukrainian party used the international conventions against cluster munitions at the artillery explosion of the Lugan airport.
The representative of the press noted that nighttime recruits were able to damage two Ukrainian VVV helicopters on one of the field airports, as well as destroy two bronte carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The children in the life force of the opponent - up to one hundred people killed and wounded, were killed by 13 people," the representative of the headquarters summarized.
Interfax does not have any support for this information from Ukrainian sources.
In the resurrected armed formations of the “National Republic” of Donbassa, the Ukrainian side had declared the transfer under the ceasefire regime of 223 full military personnel and members of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time at night, the DDR army, according to the "Armiya Novorossia", "has been trying to force Nazgardi to break the previous agreements to remove heavy technology from the area."
Then the militia reported on the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, holding six tanks and disarming 198 military personnel.
According to this table, the total losses of the opponent in all directions (Danish, Luganski, Mariupol) were five tanks, eight war-armed vehicles, more than 120 people were killed and wounded that night
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel were formed in the district of Ilovakia in the Danube.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “national republic” to expel Ukrainian military officers from the area.
The DDR agreed to do so under the terms of the arms and ammunition resistance.
The first ten military officers began to leave the surrounding areas on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense Donbass Semenčenko, 14 more rose on the night of the "Cola" resurrection.
In her Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in line with 137 branches 32 of the RF and 9 of the RF tanker” where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, both IDI and the Russian Minoboron had examined reports from Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MD RF: Russia will take responsibility for the introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take appropriate measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-corruption sanctions.
A report by the Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority states that the European Council's "conclusions" of 30 August have demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the intrepid support of the key authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unconfirmed allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country," the media site says.
The MDG expresses its regret that, despite the interests of its Member States, Eurosov has been influenced by countries that are interested in strengthening conflict with Russia.
The members of Eurosov should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a fully-evaluated "interference dialogue", the public stressed.
It is also noted on the Department ' s website that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbassa, where there has been a complete humanitarian disaster and there is an increase in the number of victims among the peaceful population.
It is recalled that during the next seven weeks in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the IMF .
EU representatives are working closely with U.S. officials.
They are expected to correlate between themselves the measures introduced during the period of action and the degree of violence.
The new EU sanctions can be severed by energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced increased sanctions against Russia in the area of defence, finance and the oil industry.
Quick ways to save university textbooks
While the value of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schryöder, who will soon move on to the second course, has made a quick way to reduce costs.
He developed a system to take the books to the elders, offering them a nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math-analysis teacher, who usually costs $180, I got a $10 seminar and a "Chick-fil-A" sign," says Shröder, 19 years old, who is studying at the Convent College in Georgia.
The necessary literature last semester would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Board of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on teachers and training skills, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas such as the Shréder system.
The book is becoming more popular, allowing students to use it during the season, and often it is more expensive than their purchase.
The Nibo Incorporated Company, which owns over 250 university bookstores, reports that the average book volume has increased twice since 2011.
Research by industry shows that about a quarter of books in university libraries have been taken up during the past spring season, says Vice-President Trevor Meier.
Less than half of all books are obtained in university libraries, according to the professional association of the National Association of University Magazines.
Here's the introduction course for the best way to make a good deal.
Buying online store
Sometimes when you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in a university library.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller is about $290 per rescurant, but a new sample can be obtained for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the held
If you're not against foreign notes or injuries, your teachers are a good option.
"Mathematical analysis" is sold for $93.49 in Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, a 25-year-old high school student from the University of Brigham Yang, says he paid 42 cents for a supported copy of the Teacher's "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Breese, director of the "Collage Without Wall" at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, offer students to explain to their professors whether they can use their previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not essential for employment.
In such cases an old edition can often be found as a very small percentage of the value of the last issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, which belongs to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying supported books.
Procat
In order to get the teachers to call, you should think that if you're good enough to talk to them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the "Mathmatical Analysis" project at a seminar about $20.
Explain the rules of the magazine where you take books, including any taxes that may be written on your notes, underlines and damages.
If you take a copy of the book, remember: If you don't return a book, the taxes may even exceed the value of a new copy.
E-books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books themselves take up an electronic license for a given period of distribution, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" bill on the Chegg.com website for six months is about $61.
Breese says that students studying literature can often find the most useful prices, as many classics can now jump free, while natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, look.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start training at Pepperdin's Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to clarify the price of the book, as this ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering the Internet, Golt says, you have to make sure that the book is in stock.
It was not easy for him to learn that lesson.
The delivery of the book he had obtained was delayed for four weeks, and finally he paid the full price in the university library.
Putin stated that the Development Fund for the Far East had been ineffective
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin stated at the meeting on support for priority investment projects and territories in the Middle East that the Long East Development Budget Fund, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles are still on deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the list of areas for development be approved in the Middle East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TIRs should be introduced into the Lord ' s presence.
The Federal Assembly, noted by the President by 1 July, had not yet adopted the list of areas for development in the Middle East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also outlined key challenges for the development of the Middle East.
Among them, increased transport access to the region, reduced infrastructure constraints - both in the internal market and in the development of exports.
In addition, it was necessary to establish guidelines for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to form areas for sustainable development that should be competitive in relation to key business centres of the ATP, the President stressed.
It was previously reported that the Overseas Development Territory could replace the OECD.
Why the Galactic Guards Can't Save Cassus Collections
Silver Stalin returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, when "The City of Sin: A Woman to Be Killed" returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
The "Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first exits, while children's films, such as "How to Give Dragon 2" also disappointed the audience.
The article “Telegraph Dr. Colina” shows that when it comes to child movies, it may be that it is a bad thing to do.
In 2014, Colin called 2014 "the worst" year in the history of children's films, and called "How to Give Dragon 2" simply "functioning" along the path of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films directed to audiences of a number of older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily exist as films themselves.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average rates of cinemaScore and Metacritic each film that took up at least 2000 copies per year between the Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account both cinematists and cinematologists suggest that this year's film production is similar to the previous year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing viewing habits and increasing popularity of current Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on a fast-track Dieneev film "The Book of Jungley," said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think time is changing."
We must admit this and not try to guess what happened before.
In contrast to the current drop in cash collections in Hollywood, Netflix's income from the current production service amounted to $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as the previous year's figure in $837 million.
Last year, director Stephen Spillberg criticised the studies because they relied too much on the French of the comics, and predicted the "crack" of Hollywood.
In light of the current fall, some commentators claim that its dark predictions were part of the truth.
As a result of a number of potential catalytic hits are expected in 2015, including "The Artists: Erie Altrona", "Minionov" and "Jorn Park", other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
The "People X" publisher Simon King recently called the fall of cash collections simply "cycle," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most cashier in history, and no one will ever survive."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with the Caucasus and Central Asian Eggs, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, it is still preferred to replace prohibited imports of products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a little more sharp than a bad mozarel," the head of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio on the quality of cheeses offered by its suppliers instead of Italians.
Mozarella and cheese of potatoes ended up in the restaurant for the first time, having a small period of food.
The paramedic must be caught within a few months.
What to do?
Move to Russia?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such clear that shocking memories do not leave him alone.
The meat was lying on the roofs all over 30 inches [30 cm] from the floor!
There you go! There you go!
The crisis!
Then I said that we would never buy anything for our restaurant in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe now everything's changed.
But for days I was put to a fishing test from the Far East.
That's what happened!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of Italy's usual things for a Russian producer in the kitchen.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy meat is served in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must depend on becoming soft enough to weaken muscles.
I've done all this with the local meat.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get that soft meat?"
I said, "That's yours, Russian!"
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant Brasserie Most on the kitchen is a walk list showing the missing products: French dishes, sea food.
The head of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the search for "Strellka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French rebels have already replaced the Tunisians, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
In fact, the regime is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The red coat is 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why, what's the reason for it so much?"
They say, "We have to pay the same."
But it shouldn't be 80 rubles!
We're going to buy the distant east windshields, but they live 15-20 years, do you imagine how much they wear?
It's worth it. It's superdelicat.
Russian suppliers are said to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign disputes.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell short."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot maintain stable calibres and quality.
Many European cuisine restaurants don't know that they'll be with them when the cheese is finished.

Sanction menu
On 6 August President Vladimir Putin signed an order on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called the main product sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import meat, pigs, meat and products from domestic birds, meat, meat, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, fruit, fruit, vegetables, cobs and sugar syrups.
Restaurants started with suppliers: product prices have grown and the same needs to be sought from other countries as soon as possible.
This is said more strongly in the streets of France, Italy and Spain, where products were delivered directly from "mother" countries.
The community had to rehabilitate before.
For example, at the beginning of 2014, Rosellhoszandzo prohibited the importation of Australian beef and an earlier year of American and Canadian meat.
Instead, the suppliers set up livestock supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions in 2014 were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential order, which resulted from the ban on Atlantic salmon and forebears, unleavened milk, seed potatoes, sugar cubes, mountains and rice.
Italian Valerio hopes sanctions can still be eased.
As long as there is a lot of restaurants, there is uncertainty.
According to the West Bank, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the proportion of imports in the primary segment was 70 per cent.
"The other restaurants will have to change the menu under local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, director, owner of the Restkonsolt agency.
If the boss's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few such conflicts, and a new menu can go two or three months.
Trigel from the "Brasserie Bridge" restaurant is ready to give up 10-15% of the lead and another half of the menu is to be reworked.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, for example, they're starting to replace the blues, such as a stench from the marble cave on the bifstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
"Sears from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentine, Tunisia, Chile, which is listed by Oxana Glybchuk, a representative of the West-West.
Slips and milk production from Europe have similar features in Russia and Belarus.
The U.S. course can be replaced by the Russian and Belarusian cuisine, salmon and seven from Norway - lososam, family, forel from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruit and fruit of European production can be compensated for by the products of domestic producers proposed from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In Mironov's view, budget restaurants will be rehabilitated more easily than the primary segment: whether there were gruelers able to distinguish Italian mozarel from Russian.
Although it is difficult to reach Ginza Project, he believes it.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under various brands and with its menus.
The dog goes for a while," says Mironov.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
The coffee owners of the Caucasus and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are aromatized by Europeans
But there are no restaurants where sanctions are not in practice.
It includes establishments from the ACP countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"In the Georgian kitchen there are no expensive products," says Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and coffee "You me!"
We don't use exotic greens."
They haven't taken any lead in the Colba's facilities yet.
Timura Lanski, owner of the Chechon N1 restaurant with the Uzbek kitchen, does not mind the sanctions: it only needs to be changed to New Zealand.
If Russia will import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, for us it will be worse than imports from Europe, he says.
The SNG can be obtained from a variety of vegetables, vegetables, pasta, vegetables, fruits.
In addition, what is imported from Central Asia is much better than the plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
We all know about Uzbek poddies that they're delicious, sweet.
No one's talking about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Minskovhos Uzbekistan Olimboi Artivov stated that it was planning to increase exports of fruit products in Russia by two to 2016.
Almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions, Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports into Russia.
The fastfood restaurants that responded to Deneng's request also respond peacefully to sanctions.
McDonald's press service stated that the location was over 85 per cent and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bosdan, head of the Department of Labour with suppliers Subway Russia, around 80 per cent of the products are bought in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with delivery of fruit and growing prices on meat products produced from imported goods.
There were no more than 4 per cent of sanctions in the Teremke.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the walker.
KFC, Burger King and "Croat Map" did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claim that the degree of location of Burger King is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian further east
On your shoulders.
In the meantime, restaurants complain that the price demand increases even on local products.
"The prices for "Grabley" increased by 10-15 per cent on average, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant twice," said Romanian Rožnikovskii.
Even in Georgian restaurants, lead self-esteem will grow by 5-10 per cent, acknowledges Colombia.
The West Bank does not reject this: "For example, the Belarusian milk production from the beginning of August was 10-15 per cent".
"The Brazilian suppliers raised prices on pigs almost twice," laments Sergei Rac, Deputy Director General Stardodos.
The short-cooked chickens traveled by 35 per cent.
We're waiting for a price from China, maybe they're burning Brazilian heads.
In the near future, the scheduled increase in prices will be 8 per cent.
Now it's so undesired to raise prices," says Rac.
According to statistics, the growth in the second quarter of 2014 was 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
The different prices will grow and go on, but it is not as fast as it is: until most restaurants have saved products for the next two months in hopes of overcoming price fluctuations.
But in two months, nobody knows.
In front of Moscow’s meria, there are dozens of paintings decorated with green and wood.
In the center of the scene, musicians play the waves.
It's a regional product festival called "There's time."
"We've been going to have a local dinner party for a long time, and here as a time of sanctions, we've tried and organized a festival," one of the organizers says.
On stage with the Greek-Greek musicians, Anastas prepares macaroni salads and home concerts, and on days there was a master class to prepare lunch with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are confirmed by organizers.
In the shelves is a demonstration of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Med from Bachiria, an olive from Salehard, fruit from the subpoena "Sowhoza named Lenin", a cheese from broken Italian Jay Clouza.
"Float for restaurants can easily replace another forest fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the fishing boat "Your People".
We've got a nose, a ride, a ride, a hug, a hat, a king's dress.
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian bear because it's a wild fish.
Norway's forest is the same aquaculture.
You take it in your hand - he won't even get dressed.
And you won't hold on to our long-lasting forest.
Only institutions with no special claims agree to replace the Italian parent parent
In the summer, his tent lies beds with the Magadan brigade, a truce, anemone, a moxon, a media with Crimea, a long way east.
Galkin is convinced that he's been fishing for a long time from the Far East.
According to statistics, more than 4 million tonnes of fish in Russia in 2013, a large proportion of fish are in Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800 tonnes.
The "Your People" hunt has been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet, before sanctions have been introduced, for example, served more than a dozen restaurants, such as the "Excellent Things".
There are now 15 other restaurants in Galkina.
The same dried can be made from our fish. He's burning.
We got tired, tried different recipes.
Now we're selling garbage through the Internet shop for millions of rubles a month.
Our fish happened several times, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkina's shirt, they're making me a Philly's bag with Kate.
Unlike family roles, they need to be deep-fashioned, but the knowledge that this fish is our father-in-law gives strength.
There are even roles from the Paltus and the Sea Oxon.
In droughts, it's true that replacing the Norwegian forest prefers Chinese.
Galkin explains this because I'm going to stop the line to think about new recipes from the east-east.
"The Russian supplyer's fishing has not yet been offered to us," explains Governor Killfish Bar Dmitri Evsiev.
For example, the same situation as other products: Russian producers could take a free knife, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America can now be mentioned earlier.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large amounts.
They are able to replace the prohibited import quickly with our farmers.
This is a ban on the first success of large producers in other countries," Akimov said.
In the past month, however, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than product sanctions.
As a result of the massive in-depth audits, Rospodnabsor temporarily discontinued the activities of three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional companies in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg.
"We are studying the nature of the claims made to identify the actions needed for the early opening of restaurants for visitors," McDonald's press release said "Dangam".
No one really understands what's going on.
If all are restricted by product sanctions, this is one option that can be overcome, says an anonymous staff member of a restaurant consulting company.
If it starts to close McDonald's all over the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of GIBDD
Cascow payments will be received without GIBDDs - so the CB intends to stimulate the implementation of the "euro Protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of instructions that, from 1 September of this year, an insured car will be able to pay for cash without a GIBDD.
The fact is, it's only about cases when an accident has been reported on the "euro Protocol" without the involvement of road police.
That is if only two cars were involved in the DPRK, not physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the limit set and both drivers reached agreement on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the Europrotocol payment limit amounts to $50,000, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will increase to $400,000.
The point is that, even in cases of minor injury, when the TIR can be formulated under the "euro Protocol", drivers who have fallen into the disaster call it.
If the police were available, it would be impossible to get compensation without the GIBDD.
The parameters set out in the draft instruction, as well as the purpose of removing this obstacle to the implementation of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum amount of late payment for GIBDD staff due to GIBDD should not be lower than the limit on the "europrotocol".
However, it may not exceed the limit set out in the Casca insurance treaty.
The idea is, of course, useful and theoretically capable of loading both DPS personnel and roads.
But most of all, they don't come to the back of it by car drivers or insurance.
The latter are now talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules on cassation.
In the case of leaders, it is difficult to imagine what work should be done in order to overcome genuine Russian conservativeism.
The driver in most cases will be waiting for the inspector to make a small accident because he is so confident.
And it is still unknown that it will be easier to win the mussels or convince the leaders of the Euro Protocol.
The depositary certificate shall be made anonymous and non-recoverable
Minfin wants to prohibit the depositary certificates on the supplier, so it will allow banks to make them a free contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that prohibits the depositary certificates on the supplier.
Recently, this instrument has gained popularity, both in terms of rates higher than in bank contributions.
The fact is that deposit certificates do not fall within the contribution insurance system and the bank does not have to be booked in the Investment Insurance Agency (ASV).
The seriousness of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and are affected by the Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ABSA, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem explained in the ABS is that customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate are trying to obtain a licence in the ASS if they receive it.
Some investors may assume that their contributions are secured by not having sufficient financial grammatical coverage and by buying the vendor ' s savings certificates.
The lack of reasonable payment of insurance certificates in the event of a bank's withdrawal of a licence may lead to a lack of understanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency there were cases when the holders of the certificate sought insurance through the court,” said the SBSA.
The problem, of course, is mental.
There will be no one to pay certificates to the buyers, since they do not have the right to reimburse the State under the law.
If the instrument had not been secured in the ASW, it would also have been prohibited from carrying out the metal accounts on which citizens are included in one of the four metals grams of gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the investment insurance system, but they exist until no one tries.
The fact is, most of all, that the certificates on the applicant are very comfortable, a valuable book that can actually be spoken in the role of quasiden.
Their transfer is not in practice controlled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and the number of customers can be changed before such a certificate is available.
The draft legislation does not necessarily require that the depositary certificate should be legally named as a valuable book which should be kept in the depositary.
In order to submit a bill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of temporary payment.
This is an analogous contribution that banks have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiffe
The protests against the NATO summit in Newport have been filed.
On Saturday hundreds were gathered at the center of Newport on the road against NATO.
On the resurrection day in Cardiffe, about 150 people were gathered at Cardiffe's room for what was described as an antisammit.

Germany sends 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will send weapons to Iraq to combat the combatants from the terrorist group “Islamic State”, reporting on 31 August ITARA-TASS, referring to a decision taken following the meeting of representatives of the Government of FRG, headed by the Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 portable anti-tank rockets "Milan" and 500 gears to Iraq, as well as 8 thousand G3 and G36 windmills.
Arrangements will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to grant Iraq another 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel made a statement on the subject in the Bundestag with a Government statement.
At the same time, Germany has not put its weapons in "heating points".
The views of the FRG population on arms shipments were divided.
Some believe that it is only possible to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The hostages killed a Ukrainian patrol cataract in the Assassin Sea
The Danish soldiers killed the Ukrainian patrol cataract in the Assassin Sea, reported on 31 August ITARA TASS.
According to the data available, this occurred in the Taganrog Valley near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezimenno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports on the shooting of two coastal security catheters.
It turns out that the incident occurred today about 16:20 ms.
The children took off the helicopters with the Golube Mountains
Two teenagers were taken to the airport in a safe place after they spent the night in the Gulf of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man were on their way soon after noon at the Govets Lip in the Black Sea.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 nights when they didn't come home.
A search team was sent into the local police and rescue teams, and a couple were found about 11 evenings around the bridgeway.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell down and shook his head.
The officers stayed with a couple of men at night and took them to bed on Monday morning.
They were rushed into a fast-paced car into the Blu Mountain hospital.
Two of the Unions met
The high-level negotiations in Minsk did not resolve the problems that had been raised but gave birth to a new format: the first people of the European Union met with the first ones of the future Euro-Asian
Also worrying (the situation around Ukraine is not patient), EU leaders and the Customs Union first discussed a number of "heat problems".
Is such a structure able to work effectively and completely; so it is clear who has taken off the tapes from this summit.
Questions were raised on the account on the evening of 26 August, when Belarus and then other Europeans saw in the televises of the new President Lukaschenko.
The leader of Belarus was an example of a detached attitude, which was a man who had just violated Jack Pot - and was planning a decent old age in a higher society.
As told by Maydan Lukasenko
The arrival in Minsk at three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukaschenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimization of the 20-year-old president.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as the full-time subject of European policy and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belorussian Institute for Strategic Research, Dennis Melyanzov, is convinced that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk as soon as possible.
"The fact that Catherine Eston met a aunt with Lukaschenko gives reasons to believe that relations with the EU will be smoother and further," he said "Figure".
There is a hidden part of this barrier: training by the Belarusian authorities began long before the Maydan in Kiev in November 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU are successful visa facilitation and readmission negotiations, the dialogue on modernization, "Figure", and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The states even took some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they themselves and their response to the leadership of Belarus have only intensified the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, has been able to maintain relations with Ukraine - much hotter so as not to lose much in trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
Another was the Belarusian leader who de jure did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-proselyts in Donbassa with all their strengths, and did not hesitate with Moscow.
Minsk did not go out of the Customs Union or ODKB, but the Russian airport is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minska on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it by the Belarusian experts.
If Lukaschenko's movement to political diversification is successful, it will be evident how often meetings in EU+TS form are to be held in the near future.
The EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Eston was unable to respond promptly to what Brussels expects from the new format.
Press Secretary Eston Maya Kosyančić simply stated that the issue was not a priority on the basis of the resolution of war and peace.
There were also reports that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first people in the new format could also be attended by Kazakhstan.
A statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaeva, who acknowledged that he was personally requested by the representatives of the EU, was made by the Caple detacht for Minsk.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukaschenko understood that not all sides opposed the fact that Minsk remained the central platform for meetings in the form of Russia-OBSE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the Eurocommission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is becoming a fully-armed European leader who helps solve the global problem.
Best friend of a European farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, including the Eurocommissions on Trade and Energy, has already brought to the conclusion that the main focus of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbasse but the economy.
In fact, the future gas supply negotiations and the TS countries' threats to the agreement on Ukraine's association with the EU are more likely to be achieved than the peacekeeping declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Guht noted, however, that EU representatives "have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has an economic impact rather than the opposite".
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine also "works" in Belarus.
Its consequences - and firstly, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are granted to Minsk, which still tests the sanctions pressure imposed on the manoeuvre field.
According to the Director of the Mission's Research Centre, an ex-Candidate in Belarus President Yaroslav Romanchuca, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to provide agricultural products to the RF for sanctions.
The delivery schemes for which Vladimir Putin urged Minsk at the summit are set up.
"Initiators of these schemes," stressed Romanchuk "Figure", "not Belarusian businessmen but Russian companies.
They have long been working on supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business needs to be restored, even through the intervention of Belarusian structures.
Second, the expert continues to believe that many Ukrainian companies are no longer able to control production in Belarus from the Ukrainian commodity as well as with a Russian market orientation.
The Ukrainian producers had an export of $4 billion in Russia, and the Belarusian production schemes could now become very expensive."
In the opinion of Romania, the role of the EU and TS forum for negotiations is ideal for Lukaschenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
It recalls that the loss of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions is estimated at EUR 5-10 billion and that the Eurocommission has now offered farmers only EUR 125 million in compensation.
The President of Belarus may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on Eurofarmers.
This can raise the authority of Lukaschenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Guests without initiative
Catherine Eston thanked the Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold the summit.
However, the paradox is that official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU form, is open, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague, stressed that the new form was the initiativer and that it was originally Kiev.
"This was your proposal to meet, without anyone having been able to discuss, not with the boutiques, the decision after the signing of the EU Association Treaty to deal with the situation currently in Ukraine," he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
On the contrary, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to the hearings, was largely against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian Diplomatic Authority, Belarus has been working hard to achieve the benefits of EU-TS interaction on its territory, and the ultimate objective of this form is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts which, in other areas, particularly in the field of security, promote and promote the leadership of our strategic Union of the Russian Federation," said the "Figure" in the Belarus MlD, a country where words have recently been smuggled.
There may be areas with payroll in Moscow
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of a paid-in zone as a method of combating overloading central roads in the analogue with other major cities of the world, gives M24.ru a reference to the Moscow earthquake on the transport of Maxim Lixutov.
One option that has successfully recommended itself is a payroll.
That's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, look at all the minutes and plus.
To mention that some decisions have been made in this regard until early," Lixut said.
Zammera stressed that for the capital authorities, the experience of Asian cities, which is similar to the structure and load of Moscow, is very important.
One of the decisions taken by these countries was that the construction of the central railway was already under way by Lixut.
The recent construction of the Central Railway is an example of not having to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient travel infrastructure, there would not have been any transit traffic in Moscow," said the mayor.
Maxim Lixut also said that the introduction of paid parks had significantly destroyed the capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities are not planning to stay on what they have achieved.
Remember, on 26 August, the Russian capital, Sergei Sobianin, participated in the ceremony of a bookmark for the construction of the first railway complex of the Moscow Central Railway Railway (CCAD).

The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodrigues "The Pride of Sin-2: The Woman Who Should Kill" did not have a revolution that could have been expected.
The first "Golden of Sins" (2005), taken at the minimum but symbolic, attended by Quentina Tarantino, has made a revolution in relations between cinemas, comics and literary novels.
He was also more revolutionary: in the sense that he destroyed the key for modern thinking the key "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (if understood under thesis of the universe neurons and of the cosmic commissions).
It should read, "Tezis-antithesis-haos".
The "Rock of Sin-2" is both erotic and dramatic, and at the philosophical level: both times he is romantic in a stupid sense of word.
Yes, part of the heroes known for their first "Gorod," although, here's where Marv (Micky Rurk) stole, he'll remember, he finished his life on an electric chair, and there's nothing here but he can pick up -- as such a folk partner -- out of the air of a knife and other volleyball.
But older people literally break up with news stories that are literally broken into the city from another film about the meaning and the relationship that viewers are asking for.
Yes, his story, which was consistently surrounded by authors at the most interesting place, is in the superintendent of Johnny (Josef Gordon-Leveitt).
She's got a lovely Eve Lord (Eva Green) and something beautiful about her Duyta (Josh Brolin).
But this path, in which Duyta, we say, in person, is no different from Johnny -- more than people like other parts of the body, people suffer from irregular regularity -- no pain or even failure.
It's not people, but we understand that it's Nure Architects: an annual cat that is too confident in itself of a game that has agreed in "Medical hunting" sex of detectives who are corrupt.
Well, when an archetype is struggling with an architect and an architect, it's not a movie anymore, but think it's an abstract novel.
And it's just funny to ask abstract questions about the logic of the universe.
Even in this troubled world, you can gain happiness from accurate Bible knowledge of God, his Kingdom, and his wonderful purpose for mankind.
War strikes from the first "Gorod" continue to protect the circle against those who possess their own fleshly weakness of the dark force.
Yes, Detective Hartgan isn't, he'll look at the fire, and Bruce Willis's always nice to see.
The main problem of the "Golden of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was very good at how a painter was talentedly combining comics and noise, and as director, he changed his idea of how to carry comics on screen.
Comexes and neurons are two aggressively opposed "realities".
The comic phenomenon was born in modern form at the end of the 1920s, while the Romans, Deshila Hammeta, the "Creature of Blood" (1929), the "Maltic School" (1930) and the "Steel Key" (1931), created a cannon of neuro, then called hard-boiled school - "Speech School".
Well, maybe a pulse fiction.
The comecs hit Gollivuda with dozens of heroes: from the seabed of Popaya - the propeller of the spina, which gave him a rich power, Supermen, Batman and Dicka Tracy to Halka, Tora, Chelveka-Pauca and other "cultivators".
But any film on the basis of the comics was something harmful: the cartoonized people were reluctant to feed the screen, remaining trapped in their environment’s “real” world.
I mean, they've been completely out of existence.
On the contrary, it is the most existing generation of world literature.
After World Wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, character, family scandals and a historical background - lost all confidence.
What Forsaits, which Tybo and Rugon-Makkari, and even the Bolcony and Rostos are generally thought-in after Verden, Osvencima and Hirosima?
Such a Romans were peacefully mutilated in the form of a metal opera, and the criminal, on the definition of a marginal, was raised to the level of a philosophical profession.
Hammett found out on his skin that this is how to work as a sanitator on the front.
He was a Communist.
How, by the way, there were, at least, close to the compartments and columns of the genre, such as the writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, the director of Jul Dassen, Joseph Louise, Edward Dmitrick.
That's why the nerves they put on first, the rough and the kinic, and the second is social.
That's what we're gonna hear about the American choice of socrealism.
The first "Golden of Sin" was remarkable because it was contrary to nature but organically connected comedix with neuron.
First on the screen, comex lived without being disturbed by his graphic nature, but did not become involved in the "current" film.
The darkness of the commercial world, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered a wonderful son-in-law, was fully worthy of Hammett.
And the biodegradable details of the kind of cut heads that the sataist decorated his nest, through the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - is a declarationary neonurar.
The "Golden of Sins-2" is not even a break, but the capitalization of Miller Rodriguez's radical stylist before the tradition of comics.
It's probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "Golden of Sin," you feel trapped in a glass of glass, in which the snow melts the playful clover.
In fact, it's usually not snow, it's blood clots, but what's the difference?
Well, it's about socialism and something to say.
Because it's only possible when we've got something where we've got it on our way, but there's a normal world where you can go back on the wrong road to a girl or tell the homeless parents that the loser is punished.
When they sinned in the city, there was no place for them, except that they had sinned, neither was there any sin unto them.
It's as boring as any rule.
The House of Sin-2 is just broken.
Justice on the basis of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ has given this innocent but minor sin.
The headlines warn: there are harmful smoking scenes in the film.
As for growth, in the most vegetarian episode in which man's fingers break his fingers, it gives him a resounding horror.
Hemmet would have enjoyed it.
French socialists should "stop and bring France in line," says the key coalition of Fraswa Olanda
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to "show a warm relationship" to the attacks of the President-Socialist, whose suspensions were not approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay together with him," he said, causing applause.
As a matter of deep satisfaction, the Prime Minister was convinced that his Government would not issue a controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the current conflict of proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macrone, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Oland invited his friends on the Socialist Party to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobara, the Minister of Justice, put up a parade to gather members of the Socialist Party and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lost faith in the future".
Martin Le Pe, leader of the very right National Front, expressed a view of the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not think that the new Government of Walla would continue for more than a few months.
France The Old King, but Prince Manuel Wall, who had to collect a new government when there was no previous flight.
"And the new one will also not be dry or cold," said Mrs. Le Pen's reporter.
She repeated her call on the party to disband Parliament, saying that she was convinced that the party could easily win over temporary elections and be ready to manage.
France's right-wing party survived the March municipal elections, and the final right of the National Front came first in May in the EU elections.
The question of the Resurrection Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of spreading into several opposing factions by the end of the presidential term of Mr. Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician from the University of Sians Po, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government could not repair the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public's opinion needs to feel that something is changing quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
"No drugstore" is out of demand.
The Swedish Arbitration Court has left without consideration the request of the Regional Ministry for the Management of Hostiles to the Gorod Non-Drug Fund.
The public was planning to borrow more than 7 million dollars from the organization as a rental fee for the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the case was not brought before the court twice.
Today, the Svardlov District Arbitration Court has left without consideration the Executive Director of the Ministry for the Management of State Property of the Region (MUGISO) to the Fund for the "Gorod Without Drugs" (one of the founders is Mr. Ekaterinburg, Eugenia Roizman).
The representatives of the regional authorities were planning to borrow 7.3 million rubs from the organization as rental fees.
Today it has been known that the trial has not been brought before the court twice, and that a decision has been taken to reject it.
Due to the absence of representatives in the MUGISO Directorate to explain, the head of the Legal Division of Maxim Titov did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to contact representatives.
Remember, this is a special one that has been working at the city centre on the streets of Berlin, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by ex-GUI Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Governing Council of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlov area requested the Sverdlow Arbitration Court to remove the fund from the building.
According to the request, the public was required by the court to recognize an open-ended free-of-charge contract in the premises of a memorialary.
In the view of the MUGISO directive, there were no significant conditions for the rental of a cultural heritage.
The Serbian Arbitration Court rejected the claim and then appealed to the 17th Arbitration Court of Permi, which was satisfied.
The same court then filed a cassation complaint against the decision that remained unsatisfied after the decision was appealed by the Fund in the High Arbitration Court, but the court adopted the direction.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded by which the Fund reimbursed the rent, which was told by the head of the city of Evgen Roseman.
The rental fee was $300,000 a month.
The previous administration of the area transferred this building to us for free use, recognizing our benefits in the fight against drugs, in a sign of respect for the Fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why did Mr. Ekaterinburg volunteered to leave?
On 24 July, a member of the Ekaterinburg pride group, Alexander Cosincev, proposed to the mayor of the city, the speaker of the pride of Eugia Roizman, to leave.
This resulted in a criminal case involving a suspect in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Oleg Kinev, who was considered the associate of the mayor.
How Eugia Roizman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that the criminal case had been raised by the fact that the "law" (p. 128.1 of the U.S. F.R.) in the blog of Ekaterinburg, Eugenia Roizman.
This was reported in the Sverdlov area GU, where the Director of the Legal Centre for Protection, Anna Filatov, addressed the relevant statement.
He said that Mr. Roseman accused her in his blogging that she was involved in crimes that her ex-husband had committed.
Mr. Ekaterinburg is convinced that "it's a regular attempt to deny the truth."
iPhone is turned into a doll
In advance, on 9 September, when Apple is to present its new development, all new runs of what can be expected from the presentation appear in the press.
With reference to American media sources, it is reported that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with mobile cell function through the joint Apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the dedicated Re/code Internet resource, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express on 9 September, which will make the new iPhone 6 smartphone available.
The companies themselves reject any comments in this regard.
This function allows you to pay for a magazine bag using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint with the Touch ID function.
It is reported that iPhone will be the first to have NFC (near field communication) technology, which will allow for non-contact payments using smartphones and appropriate cassette devices.
The NFC itself will be made available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high technology company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was introduced in 2004 under the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
Android's first smartphone with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was submitted in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account account and to pay off using Android smartphones.
In contrast, US experts emphasize that despite large investments by high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American Reuters is still cautious about refurbishment and is not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores in such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's exit to this market will thus make the Reuters faster and more active to implement this technology at their trading point.

It's a European solution, not France," Mr. Nádala "RIA News".
The representative of the French Foreign Office therefore replied to the question whether the situation in Ukraine had deteriorated to change Paris ' s position on the implementation of this contract.
For more information on the delivery of helicopters in Russia, see the article "Ogonek" "Misteral" in our magazine.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruiser in the world, is at the final stage of the negotiations for the acquisition of the same company Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to reports of people who are aware of the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, companies with market value $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and Prestige Cruises provided by customers, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (CRL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement may have been announced this week, and sources have been reported in the resurrection, warning that negotiations can still be broken.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The originals were asked to remain anonymous, since the negotiations were not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for comments when the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

The opposition companies strive to position themselves as cross-operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the governing bodies of the United States for the first public holding of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of the merger with the GENT BHD (GENT.KL), the entertainment conglomerate and casino under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Cock Tea.

Democratic Movement activists in Hong Kong interrupt the Chinese representative's statement the following day after the election decision
A group of loyal Beijing citizens stood near the border with the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the General Assembly of Peoples ' Representatives of the Peoples ' Assembly, at the same time, established the procedure whereby two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the Hong Kong leadership elections in 2017.
All candidates should begin to receive the support of the majority of members of the steering committee, which is likely to be a pool of firemen.
The decision made almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the electoral ballot and forced democratic activists to promise to stop the Hong Kong financial centre by the Occupy Central protest.
The political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, the activists of the democratic movement conducted an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands entered the city's business centre and set up a seating stop.
Briefing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the People ' s Assembly of the People ' s Assembly of the People ' s Republic of China and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macao State Council of Feng Wei were also required to make a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would meet at the building of the head of the Government of Hong Kong on the second half of the day.
Britain has not mentioned the democratic governance of Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israel's authorities are planning to join 400 lands belonging to the Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian autonomy.
By-by-sy, the decision to join the land of South Biflie relates to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli adolescents in June of this year.
On the territory occupied by the Ministry of Defence of Israel, the Ministry of Defence issued a statement in the wake and ordered the military to appoint the administration of the West Bank.
According to the representative of Gaza Saba Arica, the world community should call upon Israel to respond to "the continuing gender-sensitive activity on the western side of the Jordan and East Jerusalem".
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on "government" in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded in the wake that the Ukrainian Government cease its fight against separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “government” of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin was not in a position to point out that the eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia under the control of the separatists, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to give the Russian-speaking region an opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Government of Kiev to start negotiations with the pro-prosperity rebels in line with the clear strategy he had been following since the beginning of the bloodbath five months ago: Help the separatists to take over the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared territory of Novorosie real independence to approach Russia rather than the West.
During the first public television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return to the eastern Danube and Lugan region, which was arrested in March and April after Moscow annexified the Ukrainian peninsula of Kram 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territories of New York, or New Russia, a name that refers to the revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future when Ukrainian policies began campaigns to parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in the occupied separatist regions, the “silence plan”, reported ITARA-TASS.
"We must immediately start substantive negotiations not only on technical matters but also on the political system of society and state status of South-East Ukraine in order to comply with the interests of people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about the state were in the context of a broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to ease fear in Russian-speaking areas, their cultural and linguistic rights in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The intervention of the Secretary-General of Crimea to correct the word “unfair interpretation” Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to commit itself to the separatist revolt in the east in a manner other than the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have to face a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russians, and interviews before the start of the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.
The autonomy that the Russian diplomats had discussed at international forums would give regional Governments in Ukraine the power to establish trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in effect, by transferring the actual control of Crimea over the territory that would unite Russia ' s main territory with Crimea.
A major Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical maritime corridors, is located on the Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago.
There are also workshops, factories and lithium factories in the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Pedro Poroschenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators, following new elections, should bring about amendments to the constitutions allowing regions to have greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be quite different from that of Kremlin and separatists, in the arms and incentivisms of which Moscow is accused.
The last call made by Putin to Kiev to deal with the leaders of separatists as well followed by the new attacks last week after the Russian armies and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the front of the Pacific Ocean.
Russian-supported separatists have taken control of the city of Novozovsk in the event of which Ukrainian security officers are afraid that it is the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory before the Crimea itself.
This has resulted in substantial civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between the Novaz and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday morning, the European Union's leaders were gathered in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was 23 years of independence.
"We're approaching the point of non-interference," warned Poroschenko.
Thousands of foreign military tanks and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; leaders called for a more severe sanctions project against Russia to be taken in the event of an increase in the Ukrainian crisis.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Iloviaska after two columns of Russian bronchologists and 1,000 soldiers arrived last week in the Danube region to support the trials of separatists, Colonel Andrey Lisenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, informed the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly detained in Iloviaska as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged in the wake of the 10 Russian planes captured in the Ukrainian territory last week, reported to Liseno in the wake.
The scandal with captured photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffery Edelsten expressed his rejection of the hackers who may have stolen his newly discovered photos of Gabi Greco and the entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was upset after several of the open-ended photographs of Jennifer Laurents were posted on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with reputations.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 photographs of the star "Golden Games" Laurences and the superstar, including Kate Apton and Kara Delevin's models, Ryan, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel and Kirsten Danst actress.
The Australian actors Tereza Palmer, Emily Brajum, Ivonne Strawski and Melburne Greco also reportedly stole photographs as a result of the escape from iCloud.
In list 101, names of the nominees.
Edelstein, who made a Greek proposal last month, said Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private records and photographs must remain private.
Unfortunately, personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greece, which is located in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "failure" and that those to whom it was directed "feel that they've entered it".
It is estimated that the hacker has 30 photographs of Palmer with former Boyfrand Scott Speedman, including two frames where she is lying in a pregnant pregnant woman's pool.
Palmer's work in movies includes Love and Honor, along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Strawwski and actress from "Contained Reception" Brahman didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Laurence said to TMZ: "It's forced entry into private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his disappointment at the hacker's address and wrote on Twitter: "To post photos stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, nothing different from the sale of stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, it is not possible to tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
A possible way to steal a photo of the famous
The mass loss of the stars may be caused by vulnerability to the Find My Phone application.
The potential development scenario described the resource of The Next Web.
The Github resource has published a Python script that allows you to choose passwords for the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track your iPhone location.
The same connection is used to access the Apple ID and Apple, which is also used for access to the Apple iCloud area, from which photos of prominents have been stolen.
The script allowed the test method to find out the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces possible combinations of symbols starting with the most commonly used words.
The script author claimed that the number of password options entered was unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
When the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter an incorrect password, the account should be blocked and the user informed of the damage attempt.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to pass a password to their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripted password-producing program was written to it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource was related to the user Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was of a nature to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used for access to the “star” account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister has regularly reported side posts
Although there is no solid evidence that it has been used in the Find My Phone to steal photographs, it has already been used to deal with the use of this service.
The hackers took control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case Apple stated that the security of the cloud had not been compromised in this case, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, too, the Prime Minister of RF Dmitria Medvedev had also been tweeted earlier.
If the offenders had access to iCloud as described above, there could also be a password for the account of the head of government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource was unable to receive Apple's comments about vulnerability on Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian Five-Bor
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to known Ukrainian sportsman Anne Burjak.
The relevant order is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent residence and called on the Federation of Modern Friday to provide her with an opportunity to speak for the Compulsory RF.
In 2013, she won two stages of peace, won a silver medal at the European Union's national championship, and became a champion of peace in the mixed stage, which is one of the new types of sport.
It maintains leadership positions and in the current season.
In accordance with the rules to address the Olympics-2016 in Rio de Janeiro, it will be required to obtain special authorization from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Burjak is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to change civilization.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian embassy by Shachmatist Ekaterine Lagno, the Livovian, which is a two-time European champion (2005), the world near 2010 and the fast chess team (2014).
As part of the women's team, Ukraine has become the winner of the Chess Championship in Turin (2006), the Peace Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR terminated the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Follow-up Committee (SCR) terminated the criminal case by the accident of the Tu-204 Red Wings aircraft.
This is reported by the press department.
The decision was taken with regard to the death of the airship commander and shipman.
The judicial expert has shown that the cause of the disaster has increased the rate of landing, failure to implement standard landing procedures, and unintended entry of motors into increased direct traffic.
The flight to Tu-204 Red Wings, followed by the Prague-Moscow flight, suffered a fall on 29 December 2012 at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft jumped off the deck and burned.
At the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the shipowner were killed.
Two shipowners were delivered to medical institutions where they ended up after the injuries they had received.
Three other patients who were hospitalized with severe physical injuries were treated with long-term treatment.
In addition, serious physical injuries were caused by the driver of a car that was moving at the time of the accident in Kiev.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the disaster, the Transport Office carried out a red Wing check during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline licence was suspended.
The company resumed its work in 2013.
Alexander Emelianko started training in SIZO
A well-known Russian combater of the 33rd-year-old mixed-style Alexander Emelyanenko, who is in SIZO on sexual charges of violence against his workmate, has been totally cured of injuries and has begun training.
That's what "Championat" reports.
In May this year, the Russian Consequences Committee accused Alexander Emelianko of rape.
The suspect was released in search on 9 May in Tambo following a road transport incident that resulted in his defeat.
Emelianko-young was arrested until 31 August and sentenced on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred, and the result was that the detention period was extended until 30 September.
In the case of a sportsman's guilt, he is threatened with imprisonment for up to six years.
What power, brother?
Lenta.ru mentions the most scandalous stories in the career of Alexandra Emelyanenko

Anger was the most universal and functional human emotion
A person ' s heart expression is biologically universal to mankind, and not everyone involved in its creation of a body and group of mice is an additional means of expressing power and threats, explained by Australian scientists and the United States.
They told of their openings in Evolution and Human Behavior magazine and can read about them in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the person who has been thrown and thrown down under the bridge drawn into the thin line of the lost noses is the same in all cultures and makes him even blind from the birth of a child who has never seen him, is noted by the leading author of the study of Aaron Shell.
Within the framework of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have explained that this emotion has emerged for effective dispute management during the conflict.
The more physical harm a person can cause to another, the more opportunities he has to adapt to his circumstances, and the more he brings it to the victim with anger.
Researchers have found confirmations and another hypothesis: physically strong people tend to be more concerned and more prone to handy, feel the right to impose other disadvantages on them, as well as to prefer violent ways to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Apart from the fact that anger is primarily “a trade emotion”, scientists have concluded that the movements of each of the seven groups of men who create a sincere expression of the person should represent a more powerful and dangerous individual in the eyes of the compatriot, and thus make it possible to agree as soon as possible with its conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To check this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer of the person in which each of the seven elements of the angry person was available or missing and showed them information.
Although the broken bridges or excavated in front of the individual did not hurt the person, the more powerful physical participants in the study were unanimously recognized by such figures.
Man's anger, like animals, poses a threat: an overexpression of his own strength to agree and submit.
A man breaks down his noses and supports his lips with the same purpose as a dove that is expected, or a dove that demonstrates its calls.
“The anger “starts” by refusing to accept the situation, and the person immediately accepts the form which will demonstrate the opposite side of the effect of the refusal.
But the most obvious is that not one of the components of the angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," anthropologist John Tubi noted.
