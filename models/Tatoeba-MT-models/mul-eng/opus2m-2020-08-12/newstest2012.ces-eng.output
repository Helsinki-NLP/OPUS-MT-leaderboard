Parliament did not support the new liberation of Timoschenk
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to cancel the proposal under the new Criminal Code, which was based on the case-law of Julia Timoschenk.
The committee, which would open the way for the release of imprisoned extremists, rejected the second reading of the proposal to calm down the punishments for economic delinquency.
In October, Tymošenk was sentenced to seven years in prison to conclude a potentially inappropriate contract with Russia on the purchase of land gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal shall be handed down by the court in December.
Tymošenk points out the judgment for the political coup regime, the suspicion of the court's involvement has led to the process and to the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on which the speaker was assessed, be drawn up, supported the vote of 147 Members.
226 votes were required for his approval.
Libya's victory
The experience of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already won.
Muammar Kaddáfi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
There's still a definition of victory.
As is common in the country, in elections, Islamists win, but it's about whether it's peace or radical.
The Transitional National Council has acceded to the customary law of Sharya and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because for stealing it, it'll cut its hands.
Women can forget about emancipation, if any of the deceased is waiting for correction and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of opposing tribes will unite the border.
In Libya there will be an order which we cannot imagine and which we would certainly not want.
Because our way of life is not the only one, neither objectively the best and most likely it would not have been for the people of Libya to change.
In fact, it is with the belief that Islamic fighters have taken refuge in the help of unbelieving dogs.
He apologizes only that from their point of view, NATO did not direct any General from the United States, although Alah, whose size in each case, was praised.
If they're looking for victory in Libya, there's no West between them.
We participated in bombings, served Islam, and our policies broke out in the dictator's personality without giving any benefit.
After the pure bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not take up military service in Libya.
This fall in the area is a problem with the excavating of "crowds".
But they're going to have a bunch of red companies for a bunch of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough and the West will finally be able to cover the protection of human rights.
If you don't tell us that, you know, the law of magic.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe got to the investor search
Statistics of deaths passed across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published data on HDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy was growing across the border, Germany and France.
It's a long-term market, but today it's a record market.
Investors are not only looking at Italy but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published preliminary economic developments estimates in the third quarter.
GDP Germany grew by 0.5% expected, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter in which Germany compared to the expected increase (a rise of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), so France stated that it appeared in a moderate decline of 0.1% (original data spoke about stagnation).
The Czech economy has grown by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
On average, however, the gross domestic product (HDP) was stagnant and according to the ČSU thus confirmed the trend towards gradual slowing down economic efficiency.
The results are worse than analytic estimates.
Most important events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy has grown by 1.5 per cent annually, although it has grown by 4 per cent.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to forecast and seasonal data.
The euro area economy and the European Union between July and the end of the previous quarter grew by 0.2 per cent, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2 per cent.
The output of its 10-year debt is 28.45%.
The outputs of Italian and Spanish debt are growing at critical limits.
Problems also begin to feel like Rakousko, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The results in the Czech 10-year debt notes are below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, the ECB is voting in favour of the latter.
They often qualified for the EURO.
In the Black Mountains, they won 1:0 and the famous procedure for 200 million
The football representation of the most difficult task of the season!
In the Black Mountains and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful brave Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech football even with a large portion of luck during the second season started a luxury jump from home and will not miss the European championship again.
IHNED.cz has been following the follow-up process in the detailed report.
Almost no resurrection in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech representation and thanks to the home of the sea in the end, the great Czech and Hirarchy of Jiračk won in the Black Mountains with a happy 1:0 and a glorious process for Europe's mysteries.
The Black Horses were under pressure for the precise weapons of the Czech army until the second half.
Smollars of the game became Damjanovic and Vuchinic, who had two great chances.
And thanks to the great Peter Čecho, both Czech representation and the next year, there will be no lack of European expertise, and the price of 200 million koruna will be added to the case of the Tuscan football.
He's been playing a lot of war football since the beginning.
Both teams just got into a combination and played mostly around half a dozen.
The pressure of domestic photographers and therefore did not arrive in the first half of the year, long copies of the defenses of the Czech defence were rejected.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They've created a living protection.
Several hundred high school students have created a living protection around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme before any Israeli attack.
The students prayed the next morning before the object and then called for the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundreds of students at the University of Iran in Isfahan were created in a living room around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, where uranium is processed.
They point out that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAE) noted that Iran has not ceased its efforts on nuclear weapons, according to all.
The possible attack on Iran's nuclear equipment is addressed in Israel.
In the morning before entering the Isfahan nuclear plant, the students prayed and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme, it would be based on an Israeli press other than the Israeli Middle East target of the facility in Natanzu, where uranium is enriched.
Eater of the newborn child: does not breakfast and dinners
More than three thirds of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with over 9 per cent of schools and obese are 5 per cent of children.
Both children are most likely to come from a family with an unhealthy lifestyle, as indicated in the current study.
It is again shown how important it is for the healthy development of human beings in which they grow and the models they cover.
For example, there are up to a half times more frequent than in families of children with normal weight.
The dried food was not suitable for more than 19 per cent of obese before the study related to the global action called Obezta.
In pregnant families, it is also not common to play sports, which concerns most of today’s schools - only 15 percent of children replied that their parents will find time for active movements at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The study was conducted at the end of the long school year and attended by 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second anniversary of the action of Obezita, which is not an opportunity to support the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
Up until now, more than 12 thousand schools from 4 to 8 classes have started.
At the same time, the proper care and care of the family is one of the determining factors that causes the dramatic number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the questions, for example, indicated that it was five times a day in the breakfast and dinner regime, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper living," says one of the results of the study.
No breakfast and dinner
Experts point out that there are also relevant details for healthy development, including the need for regular family meals.
At the same time, only 23 per cent of school families eat in the Czech Republic.
Most families eat each other.
And the worst thing was to find out that in a decade of homelessness it doesn't work.
Tomorrow is the basis for the right daily expenditure.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, it is more common to consume unhealthy foods.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugar lemonade every day (70 per cent).
More than 40 per cent of the children questioned are regularly sported, and their parents have less than half - 15 per cent.
Get your food.
The other part of the study enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up of the opportunities offered by their own food according to their own taste and attitude.
"Raising preferences for Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal for healthy life."
Among their favorite foods are many dark, fat and sweet foods.
"The alarming is particularly a great deal of sweet lemons," says the final report to the study.
For lunch as the main food, they beat their testicles carefully over the yard.
But the children actually didn't want petals, and low is also fish and green food.
A Healthy Approach
The study also showed that children are willing to adjust their alarming habits if they receive proper information.
"In the control group of participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Global Presentation Obeseta there is no agreement, there has been a great deal of preference for health principles in a number of cases," says the outcome project.
This was remarkable, for example, in sweet lemonades where more children would start giving priority to common water.
Children are also more often caught in the pollutant’s throats and fish as the main food of the day and mixed sweet food and snacks.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, a firm profession.
In the introduction article on how stylists are learned, I have had so little time to do that in the initial hours.
That's not what's going to happen.
Presentations of three professors from the range, dealing with problem situations, and a seminar on how it works.
And it'll be up.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even though the course runs every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "done."
This time we met with Director Allenka (not the only boy at the course) how to dress a woman who has no perfect orientation.
And that's the majority of them.
Someone's got a short neck, someone else's a boy's seat without proper cramps, and someone else's a little bit more.
The stylist must know how to optically change the wide shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've got guys like Jennifer Lopez's woman, so bigger tits and sides and tight dog, I'm gonna make it nice to focus and at the same time don't treat a woman too challenging.
If, for example, there is a difference between a passport and a side that does not really sit on your dress or pants, then you will be paid to let yourself hear at least one such kiss in peace.
You will certainly not be sorry because the perfectly downright dress is for non-payment.
In peace dress you will feel much better than in those that keep you calm, protect you, stay in the passport and the like.
A boy’s attitude may also allow him to wear clothes with cutting, applying, lifting or picking.
Such information and types of setting are of course a lot, so I'm glad I've had a whole week to fix all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that since I'm looking at the assigned homework, it's until now.
Each of these courses received a dedicated celebrity that has two outfits: day and night.
We must take into account the current outlook, fashion style and type of position.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerro, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, I am much better personally than Britney Spears, Christina Aguiler, who has recently collected about a hundred pounds (berete, please, at the top), or young Selena Gomes.
We need to strip clothes from newspapers or look for online and print and then work on graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relation to the graphic creation.
It is also important to think about the graphic page of the style.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also create so-called product pages in newspapers (for specific tasks, for example the trend of cables, cabinets etc.).
He told us about this by the stylist and the designer Mario Kameník.
But it's until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general view
The Saturday presentation, filled with information about the type of situation, was immediately interrupted by three guests from the camp.
Stylist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jacob Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use it.
And a squeaky stylist is able to work with one suit of clothes different.
Variability is key in this case.
So you need such a moment (or if you want to originally trunchcoat) you can wear classics over your teeth and tricks like a bed, but you can also wear it on a large body, wear a boat and wear it like a suit.
Or it's enough to cover your hands or lips and then the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he said.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start messing with them," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we're going to get all these lessons to combine with what, why, when we see something else in fashion magazines at the same time.
He's not even talking about visions.
Thanks to Ben's photographers, I know again that the stylist must have been prepared with a lot more variant of clothes than how much to take.
So in the fashion story that will have ten sides (then ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "set up" at least fifteen.
And it also looks like the picture of clothing and works in combination with other tastes completely different from reality.
So we have to do this when we make outfits.
That image and style are making slights until half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which isn't just like a great singer, but images and marketing from it made the world old.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylist services is more cold.
And the famous faces of it look like they're too important (it's enough that I can do something, what I look like is different).
And if someone is already leaving us to create a style, then we have to calculate that with a very high probability, he's totally different (less) size than he really does.
Then it should not be taken to googling and find out if the bull has not written that the given celebrate is tired/shuffled and similar.
Honza and Mario told us last Sunday that the stylists aren't getting enough to focus on fashion and art to put outfit.
In his work he communicates primarily with people who are dressed, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
"If you're ordered by a manager to beat her up and fill her with nice shoes, then you can't charge her with the whole cover and say, "Oh, my God, it's a threat."
"You can find at least some things to commend and recommend what they can wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything should contain so-called "placowa" or a bag on the plate.
It's the one you're keeping around the passport and you have all the property you need.
In addition to the clear things such as knives, capillaries or stoppers, there are also silicon night (with which the styler helps focus products such as cables or cables), special clips that we fold behind the clothes if they are bigger (the pen or other material are not allowed, damaged by the clothes) or a
We just didn't listen, but we also tried something practical, we learned how to cover our shoes properly.
Even when focusing on the workshop, where there is the same surface, the track could be damaged because of outside.
That's how we made it.
We can't even touch our legs so they won't hurt themselves.
So there's really a need for generosity.
Mario made me happy when he praised my creation without reward.
The charity mentioned is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend's continuation of the course.
I'm starting to be as clear as ever as ever that going to the professional level is really not going through the rose seed to tell anyone what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run is running mostly across America.
Recent
Initially, ageless driving changes due to the whole series of major malformations in the routine early journey to the coast.
Ambience is going to be a big deal, but it's not worth anything if it wasn't meant to do anything else.
A new piece with The Run title was built before high expectations were issued.
He promised that the flight race series needed for Speed again to move the shirt back in a new direction and from playful show he was playing as a game which would not be in the action race only in the number.
We have also been aware of how interesting the passports entered, in which the main yard will come out of the car and run after them.
As already in the NFS series is common, many are a little different from what we've been waiting for.
These are potentially sound arcade races, but they're all pulling down a few of the remaining mistakes that have appeared in the series over the past few years.
So it's actually not even a mistake, but more than a demonstration of what an incomprehensible lens of the developers.
Well, well-being starts very well.
You are mentioned in the story whose main theme Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution he offers to participate in the illegal race against America.
You will be seated on the west coast of San Francisco as a volunteer and your task is to reach New York as the first.
The idea of itself brings some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each race is on different routes and the given stages are based on different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
He doesn't even have a moment to feel that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some of the environments are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a global thing.
But the ride over the desert, the southern landscape, or the high snowy peaks seem very pleasant.
The competitions have been attacked by some non-typical element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you are admitted to a singing noise that significantly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to fall into the desert.
Thus, individual competitions are quite good for themselves.
There's only a few types of them, but that's enough.
At the same time, you try to predict the required number of contests (mainly a classic race), then you get time (classic file with steps) and then you need to have a duel with one contest.
You're still involved with the police from time to time, which is still disturbing your efforts.
The news is passing out of the car.
It's only about such interactive animations when Jack gets most of them in front of someone, and you need to help him in this, so that at the right time you press the right button.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, though, these passports are in the game much less than you would have expected (in particular only about three).
As a result, this is beneficial because this element does not have a chance to become uneven and in the context of the above mentioned, it is so directed to the elements that the game heals.
The vehicle model goes in the steps of the previous parts.
This means that it's definitely no longer a person today, but it can't be said to be a prisoner.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look at others.
But the smarter way of running the older driving model is still quite good, although we would be able to find better in competition.
Then there's everything in a simple order.
We're having problems, but they're starting to reveal after a while.
Unlike the driver's model, it's not quite all right.
From this type of game we don't expect it to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if it's practical before any object you don't have at least guess how your car is kept, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when driving tight or cutting cars in normal driving, you will sometimes only easily get along with each other, but sometimes in almost identical situations your car ends in wild pirates.
Or even an attack.
Thanks to the system of restarters, it doesn't matter in particular, but it's gonna tear you apart completely.
The restarts are solved so that if you get tired or go away from the track, it will take you back to the last touching point on the track.
Only five restarters are available in each race.
When you wipe them out, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help to the case that something doesn't happen until you can rely on it.
Sometimes, though, even the restarts don't help, the solution is when it's necessary to learn to remember the race.
The great spirit of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some of these charges need to be designed in a specific way, otherwise you will not be able to enter them in a short time.
Jindy you'll meet again at the given place "civil" cars always in the same configuration whether you're already there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This tool is especially in situations where you see how between the two opposite cars are easy to drive in front of you, while when you arrive there, there are already cars in such a position that you must drive or push them.
It's important when you get to them because it's "counted" so that it's always coming straight ahead of your nose.
Soupers have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you find several places where you, regardless of time, always face the same opponent in the same place.
Most of it will end up in the game at the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get there at any price.
When it comes to you, it also increases your view of the coming vehicles, so you're probably gradually expanding.
I'll understand the purpose of making the game faster and more adrenal, but the performance is so obvious that it will soon stop you.
And it's bad because, despite a simple driving model, playing is fun and places are so active that sometimes you don't want to watch where they're going.
And it's basically one thing whether it's worth a concept with a dozen unique tracks, a number of competitions, so that there's no chance of a nude, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during a race.
You have to pay attention to gas pumps on your way because you can change the car right there, although in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American drills on the same distance and exotic supersports on technical riding, for example on clicks of mountain roads.
The main historical mode is hand in hand and mode of challenge, which are the races in individual locations you know from history.
Here you get not only medals but also experiences in your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To get higher levels of drivers, different items are taken away: start cars and end up with background for profile.
This is also recommended again with the Autolog function online, which compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other difficulties of understanding companies is the situation from the last race in history.
With your ride you get to the tunnel of metro where you're married in the darkness of the streets.
At the tachometer, you are surrounded by numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (beautiful) and in this background you are surrounded by a metro adjustment and without compromise.
In the editor, we may still have a few days to discuss whether no one really thought about the creation of the game or whether our authors really have such a big fool.
The technical page of the game is not extra, but at least overall visual opinion is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It's shutting down that at some of the most extreme moments of filming, and in some cases it's pretty tragic.
However, this is particularly true of a large number of participants when your film is not available at all.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a test.
In an attempt to enjoy the widest scale of the younger audience has produced a soundtrack from the category "every dog else", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game will probably not be purchased by anyone.
The whole understanding of Need for Speed: The Run is so wide.
If the game were to get rid of all the remaining mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
But that's the way the game works.
It's certainly a good party, but be prepared that you're going to miss out on the power of aircraft reflectors.
Singing Congregations UK attends a concert of Samet Students
The Association of International Day of Study and the Year of the Samet Revolution with Music Experience is already offering the fourth Festival of the Festival of the Academy.
He is represented in twenty high school and high school singing congregations.
The main heavy festival is two concerts on 17 November.
"The University of Karl has a big part of the festival."
"Among the congregations involved, the Pévevet Congregation of the Pedagogical Faculty and the Faculty of Humanitarian Studies is the principal director of the Václav Hamp Festival Committee," said the head of the organization team Jacub Chaloun.
At the top of the entire festival, the public is free to attend the concert of the middle school congregations, which will take place on 17 November from 14 hours before the National Library of Technology in Davis.
The program is the release of a significant Czech jazzman Karla Rožíčky Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening hours, the "Students of Sameta" concert is held in the national halls of Vinohradech, which is held by the University of Karlov.
The Festival Academy aims not only to celebrate the International Day of Study and to remember the 22nd anniversary of the Samet revolution, but also to present the public with the highest level of music and to develop strong cooperation among young people.
The principal author is the Union of Czech singing congregations in cooperation with Gymnazi Jan Kepler.
Over the course of the action they took the shelter of the Prime Minister of Prague Bohuslav Freedom and Director of the University of Karlov Václav Hamp.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubic.
In addition to popular concerts, the Harmonogram also offers a range of musical meetings, student happenings, mornings and other events.
Detailed information is available on the website of the festival www.festeacademica.cz
In the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a history of negatists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has seriously damaged the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little stable, calm and before all players are accustomed to their new role," began his lecture at the Czech High School at the European Union, Milena Vicenov.
The fact that she took her phrase "Enlightened and Openly on Europe" seriously showed that she was already in the first part of the talks when it was allowed to be described by the individual EU bodies and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could see a number of speakers from the UK Legal College.
Vice-President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye also commended the work of Vice-President:
"There was a criticism in the past that it is obvious that it is a strange officer that he can't play any role, and I have to say that everyone has expressed a sense of urgency that this role has gone well."
"It is a person who is able to listen to the twenty-seven Member States, especially to communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? What telephone number am I calling for?" as an important step towards bringing together and increasing the number of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants us to ban cheese.
Vice-President of the Council of Europe has also been committed to the agenda that the European Council has been living and will be living in the near future.
The Czech Presidency has been successful.
They often solved the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's pay was then marked by a major negative that seriously damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very intense.
It has been said that the "frmol fact" was not only the Presidency but also the next financial crisis that is being solved today.
In addition, a new seven-year budget of the Union must be adopted, which is very complex because of the current economic situation.
Whether there will be a flexible and flexible budget, which will be given priority to which countries will be given more and less support, it is all on the agenda for the next meeting.
She also recalled her main ingredients, which came to Brussels: "Entrepreneurship for Europe".
"I really don't like ugly shorts, foreign words, a hat that nobody understands.
How does the citizen understand that in Brussels there are really no dirty or dirty chickens, bananas of different sizes and that we really have to ban cheeses."
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the magazine, Czechs have a history of Eurosceptics and people who are more aware of these negative than positive pages.
It also hates the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
It considers that there are a number of factors, such as the humility of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it has then increased the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me that when Polák and Magyar come after me and comes close to Slovák, the Frenchman next to me says, "Look, what are you doing there, what is your Visegrad's four?" and he doesn't even think about it.
In the future of the Union, according to Vice-Presidents, the new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are expected mainly.
As very real then, it takes into account the concept of bispeed, not if multilateral Europe, rather than the new "European Federation."
"We have euro area countries and countries outside the euro zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"At first it was said that only countries that wanted and those who didn't want to stand condemned."
"These institutions will be more and it will be a very two-speed Europe," Vicen expects.
In this respect, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the dissemination of principles that all topics affecting the Union as a whole are to be shared between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Fire story:
IBM’s innovation begins in the second century of its existence
If someone were to search for a word that would be the most explicit expression of the IBM strategy, it would probably be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is considered to be very modern and, although it has been established for hundreds of years.
On the basis of this long term, the first head of the company, Visionist Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already said that a number of world problems can be solved easily if people are willing to think.
His word "Think!" became an impression around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal journal that began to appear in IBM in 1935).
It was also based on Watson's carefully built business culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thought of the continued movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve more," noted Samuel J. Palmasano's current manager for the year.
Improved system
In the third years Watson joined in caring for his employees like Batía's business in Čescu - people from IBM as one of the first American employees had a place of residence, insurance from employees plus an elegant employee uniform and a system designed to replace the best buyers and traders.
Also developed has a long-term IBM and customer relationship.
Since the beginning the company has been a genius in the challenge of talent - as one of the first world companies has abolished any discrimination, so she could choose.
According to the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana in the face of IBM will launch a woman - Virginia Rometta next year.
This in IBM has been taking place for thirty years, still leaving the position of sales, marketing and strategy leaders.
In recent years IBM has made so-called jams, online Brainstormings, many of which are emerging from future strategies and innovation.
It's not surprising that ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with a good name
A certain position in business ensures the firm's strong internal and external images.
"From the beginning IBM had more concept of an institution than only technology companies," said Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"The IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for technology use," added George Colony from Forrester Research's consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market equally.
IBM - or "Great fashion," as it is viewed in the United States by her family as one of the largest companies in the world over a hundred years.
It is probably the most outstanding technology company - develop hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the scale of products from nanotechnology servers.
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees won Nobel Prize.
Its research includes banknotes, payment cards, financial swaps, magic code or discotheque.
IBM lost $220 billion this year to the second largest technological firm in terms of market capitalisation (the first Apple) when Microsoft first introduced it in 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations have come into the customer's experience and time - IBM has not, for example, given a share on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCr computer.
"If your business is on the move ahead, you can't emotionally point to the past," says Samuel J. Palmasano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave it.
Unlike the Competitive Microsoft that basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
IBM markets share services to the greatest extent, after Friday's break, software and hardware are created.
In 1990 he was still more than half the most powerful hardware agent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets of $15 billion, while also investing 58 billion dollars in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investments continue since 2008, when the new financial crisis first hit the world.
IBM is one of his first head, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the amount of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is currently facing an unaffected crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price has risen by 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has continued to grow.
The IBM company password is to change everything, not just its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM History: From the ending of the series after the flight to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago and originally had a complex name Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was taken up until 1924 - originally referred to as the sign used for business districts in Canada and South America.
On the basis of the later IBM, it gave a team of four companies whose stories took place in the 18th century.
They own technologies such as the need to announce "pockets," so the hours marking the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the company's supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired the chief competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then represented the founder of IBM - in Watson's ideas there is still an irrefutable business culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name tells us, began with the production and sale of all possible machinery for business - from pastries of meat and cheese after lunch.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, he doubled his business to nine million dollars and began expanding company expansion into all the worlds.
Watson was so inconceivable for the company that after almost forty years he shot her at his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA to fly into space - in Mercur, Saturn and in 1969 the famous year of man on the moon.
In mid-1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pecker," which set up the computer standard at that time, called IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the production of computers by the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to fully offer advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that has been paid in the last three years of IBM - is the concept of Smarter Planet, "the smarter planets".
Its objective is to make wise use of technology in areas that are still not planned and to improve the situation, for example in transport or city management.
In the area of trade, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in Turkey.
It was founded in the present Czech Republic in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, the Centre for Strategic Outsourcing is also running in Brná.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is living in Prague and is also a global research team living with a voice recognition.
A savior of an unfaithful wife:
Iveto, leave it alone. I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtár (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtár (53) became not only protector of Ivety Bartosh (45), but also a millenarian, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the rose dream and return home.
But now she's waiting for her disagreeable and she's setting clear rules for another life.
"The Pope can come home, but not as my partner," explained Richard.
When Darina Richter provided Bartoše asylum in her home in summer, she apparently didn't even think that her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved away from Riyadh after 30 days, Pepa didn't leave the song.
He even publicly admitted he loved her.
In time, Darina declined, her husband’s relationship gradually calmed down, and now she even gave him a break.
The shooter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If the Richter and Bartosh were divorced only once, he will not be waited by his wife's open hand at home.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will take him away."
"But he does not live like my beloved, broken old village, but as a man with whom I have a certain relationship," Richter said with the fact that she has since her husband turned her back and only continues to be in love with each other.
Joseph's closing his back door. It's okay.
"The decision of a wife I respect."
"I'll be with Iveto and I won't change it."
"The husband continued his paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I care about repairs, garden, property, I buy."
"Darino and I play perfectly normal, just because we don't share the bed together," said Blesk Richter.
If Richard also finds new love, he won't be able to protect her from it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault that I fell in love with Ivety and I take all responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst female abuses: Are they related to you?
When you ask men if they can eliminate some typical female crime, they're all very ready to get rid of their hands.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following order, where are some of the women's crimes that can perfectly pour blood into the liver?
Buying
Does your second half tell you that you're dependent on buying?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one set of clothes a week?
You're buying fun and together in the woods?
Then in your case, you can talk about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that they would have to buy their shopping carts at least a little bit.
But tell me, what would she do if she just walked through the trades with clothes, looked for a well-fashioned purpose and then all (in an ideal way in different colors) were to try in the office?
Even though for most women it's a horse purchase, for men it can become a ready-to-be match.
Just remember, how many times you've told yourself that she'd rather wait for you before she came in...
Uninterruptible Disappointment
"I'm not too fat?"
"I'm supposed to lose at least five kilos - should I start having fun?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these worlds remember anything?
Yes?
Then you belong to the women who are content with what they look like.
Not that you should stop worrying about yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners keep complaining about themselves.
The stronger the sexes also agree that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more likely the women are to be.
Order and purity at first place
It's like an endless circle.
The windows are closed, the use of the window, the discharge of the pressure, the weight of the dust, the drying of the outside - and it's at least twice a week.
Do you read to your partners that he broke a spinal cord on a clean bed, a child who stopped the cut-out wall and burned a broken living wall with which you had done so much work?
If you're suffering from this "injury", try to realize that there's nothing to change and order and cleanliness should certainly not be in the family's first place.
This harmless touch after cleanliness can threaten your relationships and family life.
Ripping
"You used coaches stick to your neck."
"Are you gonna take your old shoes tomorrow too?"
"The cold morning doesn't belong on the ground."
If you come to your partner like this several times a day, know that you can trust him.
Of course you don't think that's bad, but you want to make it all right.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't want to go into them so much more...
Dizziness, swelling
Some women also have their own conversations, their tears, but also their hatred and association with someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and they like to do things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Almost every one of us will be thrown out here by some little harmless pig or whore.
Hands on the heart, it's about all women.
On the contrary, they are the most common strains, which are popular and often dowries, almost everyone rejects and they are for their environment - mainly within the framework of a female working group - particularly dangerous.
Jágr and Voráček helped the assistants to win Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jágr shared in the morning NHL with two assistants at Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina's ice and is again in front of the production of Czech players in competition.
From the look of the nine-year-old star, Claude Giraux was quoted in both cases, who added one more puzzle and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assistants in the game also noted Jakob Voráček's partner.
The jury, after consulting the marine journalists, claimed that Giroux had predicted a big evening.
"I told him before I recorded it, he gave a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jágr, after his action Giroux gave Giroux a bullet from the first Flyers shot.
Some time later, he had a second step for the Czech team.
The Voráček fought behind the Hurcanes cococ and presented it between the rounds to Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first stop was reduced in the weakening domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially Giroux.
After working with Jagrem, he shot a third ball and then shot his gun and ran the race into Wayne Simmonds' fourth branch.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that she's the best player in the league, but she's definitely one of the best three," Jagr assessed his center.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would be playing hockeys like him."
"That's what I'm happy about."
"I want to play it."
"All those years in NHL my roommates tried to play on me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina from the game was still playing the drama, all over Tuoma Ruutua, and again Dwyer, who had survived the shooting, got into a different branch.
Another complication, but he didn't let Matt Read finish counting two on one.
"He's been very busy in our Pronger song."
"He jumped the trigger, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner."
"I've tried to meet him and I'm glad it went out," wrote the last bank of the game from my Voráček point of view.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
The Czech defence of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win a fight against Buffalo, and in the second third he resigned because of injuries in the upper part of the body.
Candiens also lost double-ranking leadership and lost after the gunfire at 2:3.
One of their trips didn't change Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach is more than a lost point of hate than a big nightmare of the back row, where only five defenses were played.
"It's bad."
"We only played escape with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it briefly, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We couldn't stand it."
"We were supposed to simplify the game, pull the ball out of our dog."
We've had mercenaries," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Czech banker Andrej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg savings to the top 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
About the Jets, who broke the five-pass series, five different shooters were divided.
How travel prices have developed since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sportsturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Traveling offices at that time were sold in the woody majority of the country's socialist block, since travel to the west was very limited.
The frequent tourists thus traveled by sea to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Socchi on Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, to Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The highlight was the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime had moved to the West and the roads of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the period of socialism was that it was not possible for the citizens of the socialist block (i.e. also the Czechs) to travel freely on their own even within the socialist countries.
In the event that the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter from that country, or he could not have been an individual road.
Traveling officials at that time also offered their way to the West, but they had to face the night before with a package or have in the travel office "good-known".
But it wasn't won anyway.
The so-called currency oath, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not made "politically independent people" who could not travel at all.
The Czech-Slovenian exchange was not an exchangeable exchange, but without the foreign currency it was not possible to obtain financial means (the Western exchange) on its way to the West.
However, in the farmost part of the Czech territory, there was a large number of chats and chalups that made their way through Cheši and this habit survives today.
The journey of the Czechs has been such a real revolution since 1989.
While it was allowed in the NDR or Bulharsk as our maximum by 1989, the elephants spent Czechs abroad 4.5 million permits throughout the world.
The huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible for us today to travel freely by 1989 as part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, visa obligations were lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, which triggered a massive wave of short-term visits, especially from Austria and Germany.
The Czechs could not afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to see it for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech trains slept in parks because our former incomes did not allow us to pay for hotels or pensions.
The typical route of the Czechs was at this time driving their own food, condoms, salamis, etc. to save themselves.
Another important moment was the establishment of a free exchange of Czech crowns, which our tourists could finally buy for the Western world after many decades.
However, our standard of living and our average payments were up to this point, which was released around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of increased demand for travel, travel offices began to prepare regular flights from 1997 to charter flights, which resulted in an incredible decline in the number of discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990 ’ s, the Czechs had already had a visa-free relationship practically into all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which further facilitated our journey.
Another interesting moment in the history of the revolutionary journey took place immediately in 2000, when, thanks to a significant questionnaire from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter year to exoticity, it was in Thailand.
From this year on, every year, tourists travel direct charters with Czech tourists to warm distant countries, the annual winter will fly directly from the PRC to the twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting some 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our evolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa for Czech tourists was cancelled and our country was definitely organized among the world’s largest countries.
In 2008, the Czech Republic also spent more than half of its authorised abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history on a foreign basis, including the cost of accommodation for more than 15 thousand people.
The foolish crowd will find the President again, but it is dangerous
Almost five months is a Czech football without the president and it is dangerous that Ivan Haška's movement in the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known after another extraordinary wave gathering that takes place on Thursday in Nymburg.
However, there is still no agreement under which the electoral order will act.
Without it, she will not even vote on what three candidates will be elected.
Interested in bringing Czech football are Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashek refused to work in June and called on his colleagues on his way to join and find a strong personality that would lead a football future.
Just in the spring after the Hašk's football took its way back between the two tied cameras, which could not match the common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates to the National House of Commons in Prague were sitting on the shelves, as the meeting remained blocked and was not only about the way of the elections.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote at the meeting itself - whether only statutory representatives or full-time trust officials.
In this same paragraph since then, there has been a partial agreement which has also helped to support the recommendation of the Constitution for State and Law which does not allow full power to be represented.
Contests, however, are still in charge of the electoral order.
It was too clear that neither the Executive Committee nor any other committee, which had already held its meetings, whether they were good or extraordinary, would be able to resolve in principle.
The view of the option of choice has changed several times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed to the 3rd wheel to exclude the possibility of a path?
"The issue is whether to act in accordance with the rules or to find another model," noted one of the three Vice-Presidents of FAČR Dušan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
According to the provisions of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the room than the candidate.
It must certainly be willing to go to the event to win a candidate who will get a higher percentage of votes from both chamber.
And the Czech side is promulgating the condition that the victory must be obtained by at least two-thirds of this percentage calculation.
"Because it would then leave the meaning of two previous cars, it would completely go beyond the two-dimensional concept," explains the intentions of the Free Sea side, which would be the best way to keep moving and volitate according to the conditions in force.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the probational order is derived from all the candidates most from Pelt.
"I'm going to make it best known by state."
"To prevent any possible misunderstandings like the last wave of events," said owner Viktorie Plzeň, who is first candidate and in his statement, he was particularly limited to Pelt.
The ball stays optimistic.
In Nymburg the new president will know and believe that candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All of us are very calm about today's national team process on Europe's mystery."
"The football will be on a happy holiday again, it will be more willing to work," said an appleist, who has three of the greatest experience with football management at both professional and regional level.
Rachel's more stable.
"I hope in the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very satisfactory."
"It's not between people from Chech and Moravia, but there are efforts aimed at adapting the rules."
"It can cause the valve to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, he wins a healthy mind," said Rachel.
It's been a long time on all sides of the agreement.
Some meetings were likely to be played directly in the Black Mountains, which is who will be the perfect football generality in the game.
The flight specialist who was to travel to Podgorica except for the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, who did not leave Prague due to technical disturbances in the morning and looked for a replacement option as part of the executive committee to deliver the cargo guide.
Finally, it may be a decisive meeting at a ministerial level that can be reached in the middle.
Minister of School, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to receive the most powerful sports association in the country to the agreement.
In the game, this is a lot: state aid, football reliability and also the ČSTV wave set, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of the Saxka.
He's going to fight the president because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If the head of footballists Plzná Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary wave hall, who would have completed all his talks on the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have joined in the struggle for excellence.
"If there were a quality appetizer, I would fight for it and I wouldn't go to the vote."
"But no one has been able to find such a person for the present situation," said the CTK Paclík.
In the battle with Miroslav Peltou and Jindřich Rajchlem's wife Paclíka motivated himself to try to get into the path to the head of the FAČR.
The Paclik also points out that in the event of its victory, the President would only be held until 2013, when there is a regular wave of action on the programme.
As a result, he would like to see an experienced and smart manager who is not too busy with football.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with a Czech football right now."
"That's how I want to change my view," he said.
Paclík is now most concerned with Pelt's connection with the President of the Plenary National Football Association, Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial story known in the background as a powerful lobbyist, who has the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the fair assembly.
For Paclika it's so unfriendly that Pelta is in the presidential position.
"If he wins, then the current position is preserved and nothing in the football is going on."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, which is a famous businessman, this football wouldn't work any more," Paclík said.
It also notes that Pelt's name was found in late in the investigation of corruption cases, from which Pelta went without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's winning football would have brought."
"And how do we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who has also taken over his former production to "prosperate a swimming club if Pelta became president."
If Paclík would triumph in the fourth election, however, he would be able to present future cooperation with Pelto.
He also considers another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclík supported before the spring wave of the storm that ended with the hurricane.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go after."
"I have great abilities."
"I'd be able to imagine him as the Chief Representative."
"But the manager couldn't run an association."
"I also don't wash my nose where I can't do it," Paclík, who in September drew great attention to the fact that he stood behind the call of the decision committee in front of Mr Macelo, who rewarded Dagmar Damk.
Paclik says he'd find himself in charge of an association.
It is called for its ability to manage private companies, since last year also the Chief of Staff, Plzni, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Prime Minister's medical triumph.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to his particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that need to be affected by the disciplinary and disciplinary commissions, which is leading to unpleasant situations," Paclík said, which undermines his antipathy, for example, to partner chief Daniel Cretienne.
One of the priorities would also be to consider the implementation of the FAQR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help the political elite to make more money from lottery tax.
"It's one of the key things the new president should hire."
"When it comes to gambling, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but at the same time they have to tell where money is going," he noted.
As a competitor now Paclík doesn't even take his relationship with the swimming club, he claims that the FAČR President should be "foreign".
The ball is again connected to Jablonce, Rachel with the Purgatory Duke.
"It's not ideal."
"I can't see, but I don't even mean to transfer my shares to the swimming club and for a year and a half back there," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new states of FAČR that would exclude the choice bed
Two days before the wave gathering, one of the candidates at President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of the election, it would be possible to have a new approach to the FAČR which would definitely exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonese official is optimistic before the fourth meeting in Nymburg and believes that the pre-war will significantly lead to the success of today's football representation.
The President has already promised that the right of representation and financial acquisition is agreed to concentrate in the event of a vote.
He decided to go to the elections before the last wave, and so his two-month retirement could be held so that he could begin his football exercise presentations and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been making football for a long time and expect the president to know on Thursday."
"It feels like it's the highest time for association to lead someone," said a man who is primarily associated with the apple club, but who spent several years in Sparta and the executive committee.
That's why he's supposed to have enough experience so he can run a Czech football.
It is convinced that today's conflict with the will is the euphoria that ruled in the time of the government of Ivan Haška.
"My Lord's mercy on the red whale herd was approved by the states that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If different explanations were not allowed, we had already been in the chair since September," warned Pelta.
He considered the most important document of the civil society to be an annual delegation.
"If I become the president, I will take it as my personal mission and I'm willing to carry out my personal responsibility if I don't. "
"It's a basic thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He's been trying to keep up with his opponents.
He had already announced that he would be able to present his cooperation with Jindrích Raichl, who is recognized for his legal education and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He didn't even hit Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which, on the other hand, left a night dry on Pelt.
"There's something moving in the football over a year, he's already achieved some success."
"However, his attacks were inadequate and many people in a way that triggered the campaign."
"And so a number of them now doubt his real character," he said to the opponent's address Pelta, who remains faithful to the proclamation he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, he believes, is knowledge of football from the lowest competition until after he's represented.
This should be an explanation of the hidden photo.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the case of Bohemians or the sound of a long corruption scandal."
"Now I would go back to meeting with a private and state sector to ensure enough money for the entire football," the CTC said a six-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to the head of the football wouldn't mean any personal cleaning.
"I should first meet with full-time individual employees," he said to Strahov, where the long-term government is taking on an understanding of the nervous system.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are taking place at the end of the summit, they believe that they will not go to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If I'm the only controversial point that's going to be in the third circle, then we'll be able to move through it."
"The football needs reliability, and here it is only because it will finally have its leader back," Pelta remains two days before the possible day of its functional career of optimism.
Rachel promises that under him, the FACHR will start working hard
If the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic had been elected vice-president Jindrich Rajchl on the fourth floor of the Czech Republic, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rachel, however, promises that if he makes his choice, he will work hard.
He wishes to make system changes and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for each football area.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into the football game and continue in the work that former President Ivan Hashek started.
"As president, I would like to hire a football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representations, professional football, post-honey football."
"But I don't say I'd do anything by myself," said Rachel in a discussion for the CTK.
"I am a team player and I would like to share competences in the Executive Committee so that each member can be assigned to certain areas."
"And I'm going to hand over the hard work to get a football on a mile ahead of each segment."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football industry, he considered that he would not be running again.
"I know I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that I won't have people who'll keep throwing me clicks under my feet and suspect my every step," he explained why he was crying.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give it up because they'd give it to others."
"It's a trust I can't just take," he said.
It motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haskek.
"For these two years, a great deal of work has been done, and I don't want to stop it now."
"There are started processes that will have a sound for up to a few years and I would not want anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelty, could be back in accord with the situation before the Hague.
"I believe in systemicity, and that's something I think Mirek Pelta can't do."
"They're especially attached to him by people who would make a football so he'd only be allowed for you."
"I can read a lot of things, but of course I'm not a stranger."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just you," noted Rachel.
It also claims that he would only be the Czech president.
"Even if some people try to claim the wrong, I'm going to do it for Morav's maximum."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and maritime parts whose winners would go to the first league."
"It wouldn't be the same when there are only three sailors in the lake, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
Since the president's boss, Tomáš Paclík, also joined the president's team, he is unable to figure out his choice.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me for its vice president and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Raichl, who, for his success, considers the saving of tens of millions of dollars on non-profit contracts, the conclusion of television contracts and the consultation of lottery law.
However, it is for the contract to be concluded that the vessel is not to be removed for one operation.
While Pelt says he's "disqualified to return to the Czech football of trust", the second of Paclík's contestants is considered to be a strong candidate who has a football to offer.
"No one can doubt that in Plzna this year he took a great job."
"If he had been chosen, he would probably have continued in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not necessarily have changed his personal presence in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to screw it up in his own profit," said the Rivall Rivall.
The most beautiful European pools
Switch to Blue
Julia Stanek
From a view of Ufona, a swimming pool in Budapest: Anyone who is traveling to Europe can experience his blue sight - and after a visit to the city or travel, let his tired legs rest in thermal lavas.
The book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder appeared on the open road for one and a half years, it was not possible to miss her behind: her lungs.
The bed of a sign on the water led to the height of the art of created dolls, was sailing against the marble pupti (I set up a small nest for a boy, a child (s wings)) waiting on it on the edge of the pool and admires the carefully restored secessary swimming pool.
If she was liked by some shipman, she took her to her writer - even with remarkable details about how the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 ships have examined this way the historic architecture of Meder and now presents it in its right-hand book "Badefreuden (The Happiness of Shopping) ": People's Shipyards in Munich, the historic Palace of Ships in Schwarwald, "The Hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "Cesta for the most common beaches in Central Europe": Vedle Germany, Rakouska and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a truly enthusiastic shipping culture.
With sports it doesn't go too far, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
The connection is only that falcon swimming must be calmed with soft cassettes and oil spills, while health-care runners can breathe the smell of death forests or listen to the happy lighting of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the actually floating must always be so nice," said Mrs. Meder, living in Vienna.
"That's how I started to gather the beautiful flowers."
Water cold doubles architecture
Hearing in the Scottish pool and etheric oil for sauna - the factor of the weather is therefore so great that it concerns all the meanings, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders are trying, they can be a real trap for the eyes: "The place of shelter is a man in a cold water."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically duplicated: high neck, wooden jaws, jumper puppies.
The malformatic "Badefreuden (Sudden of Buying)" series provides 190 pages with all that needs to be learned about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - it stimulates but especially the taste of jumping into the sea.
A remarkable example was found by the ship's collector, Mrs. Meder, on his way to Hungary.
According to the beautiful healing pools, such as 100 years old Szechenya lakes in Budapest, she found water with showers in the original beautiful lake (the snowy lake in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal lakes, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the building form of a cage (Városos Termáfürdö in Jasberén).
On the other hand, many large-scale swimming pools are available in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has from the Kurish central swimming pool all over the city, you can look at the snow covered by Arlberg in St. Anton in the outdoor pool - and: In the parlour lounges there is a window from which you can see the movement on the ski lift.
About the most beautiful design of the pool is expected by holiday guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like an ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the top of the three open fields in the winter, the couple are walking along the back of Ötztala Mountains to the sky.
Alhambra and Schwarwald
Not every swimming pool collects Mrs. Meder pach's color into the sink.
Many thermal baths are to feel after the sire, in the sandy Arpáds in the Hungarian Békescsbæ, it smells after the heat of oil to the extent that a person doesn't believe he's got into the treatment pools.
The fungus comes from treated water with alkaline hydrogen numbers that are almost black and its compositions cling to the skin when only man enters the pool - some of the special experiences of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also one place in his search for beautiful sandy beaches: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate pool Luhačovice, she landed on a closed ground.
In 1902 the architect Dusan Jurkovic's design was finally closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked out at the breaking windows of the red-white- yellow section building, she saw how the dust spread between her shoulders.
In contrast to this, they were placed in a cosy swimming pool in Schwarwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These facilities already have three phases of construction; man can detect not only the novoroman properties that come from his origin in 1844, but also the maurska sine in the style of Alhambra, which was connected about 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite holiday resort of the pools of Ms. Iris Meder, not just because it comes from Schwarwald.
"It's already some performance, to combine so complex building blocks into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, the offer to the thermal pool is obviously of extreme concern.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check trading with comedites
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving his business with agricultural resources?
According to the SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann believed the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the head of the group wants to work out the consequences.
Hamburg--
For the public, it is clear: 84% of Germans submits according to one study as unacceptable to banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the questioned even require the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to emerge from this trade because the world's poorest problems are widening.
This is the result of Forsa's investigation into the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global comedian exchange rates are leading to high prices and banks are therefore not in agreement with the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at the chief of Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
For the first time, camedicatures were intended to ensure price adjustments by traders.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that the participants in the capital market are interested in high-risk trades in response to tenders and requests - and in the light of the lowest gains.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised that the benefits would check and said that no trade "would be for the good news of Deutsche Bank to be given in cash".
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group is monitoring the development of Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the control will be closed and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to apply.
At the end of the winter, representatives of banks want to report the consequences.
Finally, trade cuts with comedites or even full refusal could be made.
Ackermann works with his image.
The Head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "The meeting on growing food prices is particularly dramatic, as regardless of the banks today, harms the general public."
Let Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist be responsible.
"Deutsche Bank must delete from its portfolio all the items in which money is used for food prices," Bode said.
"Please, Mr. Ackermann is about the cold of people suffering or about the news of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view is at first seen as surprising, but it is clear that the head of the group a few months before leaving the office would like to leave the perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the event would not go to the Board of Supervisors unless it was planned.
By turning away from a controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And you don't have to worry about possible losses - you should consult him at the end of his speech.
Any other investment in raw materials would have answered
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
Already more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institute of Force interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, it is reasonable that Deutsche Bank is offering investments with which food prices are linked.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was participating in such transactions: Any other person would, as a result of the investigation, tell all the investments in which the money relates to speculation with raw materials.
43% would protect known prior to such a bank, 49% indicated that they would think about cancelling their account and moving to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with tops, floors and happy end: The Rakouský Pavilion from World Exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 received prices, became a Vidni museum, remained empty and abandoned.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it rises for modern relief architecture, for clear forms, painted halls, heavy masks and new construction materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Royal Palace of architect Karla Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its ease and highly effective steel and glass construction.
The building is still dedicated to the millimeter of modern architecture.
He praised the architect so that he also built Pavilion Rakouska for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-storey BMW Palace plus as the key to the construction of a later building in Munich at the end of 1973 he was internationally celebrated.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by the world exhibition Pavilion, it was built in Switzerland Garten at the Südbahnhof (South station), rebuilt and opened the 20th century Museum in 1962 - it was called the "House of the 20th century".
But for the museum there was no space or technique - there were no walls to raise artistic exhibitions, no air-conditioning.
However, it was used until modern art was expected in Vienna of the new state.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and is getting more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz rebuilt the palace, now called "House 21st century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Modern Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere will open, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy purpose in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco was announced, which became the new director of the Belvedere Rakous Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical art with a significant career, i.e. in a young cruiser, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the modern museum Salzburg, has undergone considerable reconstruction in politics and monuments, has provided public funds and private sponsor money and has determined its use.
In addition to contemporary art, the work of the sugar maker Fritze Wotruby should be presented with the same presentation, the coffee shop and bookshop should be set up, and the office building should be built.
Close surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the perfect containment.
Not only was he emotionally reconstructed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's six-storey buildings in Vienna and won the competition, although in Switzerland he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and Pavilion was "immortally important place" for him, where he " almost every weekend" visited the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building that had already lost its size and ease of use when moving to Vidna.
Today's reconstruction has been much more difficult: Building has been "a catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of closed phases have been changed, used by the sealed lens of the sealed insulated insulation glass and replaced by a special safety layer.
The breast-bones were strengthened or altered, and the azbek filled with the tops were resounded.
Two underground floors provided room for new use, abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street, providing lighting to the entrance leads to the bridge - almost new building, but still upstream Schwanzer's palace.
The original entrance door was kept, the building was sealed in an old anti-corrosive red tonne.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And it's all for the strict monitoring of the memory agency and the low budget.
"There was often a material that was good and cheap and also liked the memory office," says Krischanitz and points out on a broken basement.
Over all the pressures, problems and reconstruction remained flexible and air-conditioned.
It was a difficult time with a pilot who came here from Brussels, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to wake up the proper consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in the wrong place, as urbanization has come to an end: In the area around Switzerland Garten creates a completely new "City Square at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy occasion: In the 21st century, he could receive support from another Kristchanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporère Kunsthalle and how it is to hear it, he is already with the city of the neighborhood in Switzerland Garten.
The road is planning a package for the winter crisis at a millionth.
The road has been hit by a crisis plan that must prevent the explosions of trains in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It's gonna be a million.
In the fight against winter due to train and delay, Deutsche Bahn is issued this year in more than EUR 70 million, according to a report in other newspapers.
The "Build" newspapers brought a preliminary report calling for an internal group plan to be calculated by 2015, totalling around EUR 300 million.
It should also help improve the use of trains and rail networks under extreme weather conditions.
It is also planned to double the number of internal and external employees by 16,000 persons to remove snow from rail equipment and fireplaces.
The aim is to release the pressure to start the operation and 90 per cent for the necessary escapes during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the chief of Dr. Rüdiger Grube warned of the highest level of meeting with government and industry representatives in the wake of the explosion of trains and delays during the summer.
In the past winter, she had serious problems in personal transport because she had insufficient reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, delays in the repair of ICE trains shall be allowed
The road has also not been able to determine that ICE trains must probably be allowed to be partially controlled when one ICE train arrives at the main Koln station to destroy the repairs.
Deutsche Bank pays a million interest in the United States
After the explosion around Chief Joseph Ackermanna comes to the new U.S. trampothes: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages.
As Deutsche Bank would no longer have problems at home, she agreed in the area of its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in one equivalent order (106 million euros) in order to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a whole range of large banks that the social banks have made false promises to purchase financial products; the risk is likely to be reduced.
Such papers have been lost during the crisis a great deal on the value and the banks have lost them.
"We are relieved that we could solve the issue without the need to bring the parties to the court," said the speaker Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt by comparing it.
It is also paid for Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the ambiguity of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for social banks in the United States and helps banks to protect customer requests.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for the resulting billions of damages.
Now finished equations are their first kind.
The regulator also appealed to other large banks and complained in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In suspicious hypothetical lists it is called Mortgage-backed Securitys.
They're based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bubble fell around real estate in 2007, it became a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its opinion on the rise of the financial crisis.
Even though it happened a few years ago, it's now going to the banks in the morning of the harsh wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have submitted numerous complaints to make any changes or make any mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) filed the largest voluntary complaint.
It comes from 18 international banks that two U.S. state-owned investors, Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac, lost some 200 billion dollars in mortgage transactions.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, which relates to more than $14.2 billion in total sales from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority requires that the French Constitution be responsible for "substantial losses" without adding any specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as irrevocable and declared it to be intended to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru Buffett is investing as much as possible in the IT IBM.
Since March, he has bought a share of more than $10 billion.
So far, significant US investor Warren Buffett has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers because long-term company development is only expected to face problems.
However, he now read IBM’s business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand for a long time that IBM is offering services in particular and is planning computer systems for the IT division of other companies.
Warren Buffetta's investment is held in the financial world to match the rite.
As a result, the parent Tower of IT IBM is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has been operating at the U.S. economic power station CNBC, which has been buying IBM from March at $10.7 billion.
His Investment Holding Berkshire Hataway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett says even IBM didn't know anything about his engagement.
He thanked the management that he was trying to cope with the economic crisis even with the good results.
"You did a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been spending a long time on lucrative IT services such as operating accounting centres.
More than 100-year-old computer vendors also offer software and advice as well as executive computers for companies.
Buffett got away more with technology companies today.
He claims that he only invests in companies whose activities he understands.
Instead, Buffett sold it on a freight train, on a machine or on a machine.
His Holding Berkshire Hataway owns about 80 of his own daughters company also participated in a series of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, 81-year-old master took over a small textile company Berkshire Hataway and built with it one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
That's why for many investors around the world is a cultural institution.
His almost unfathomable sense of making money brought him the look "Orakel from Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's share increased before the start of the storm by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the bridge and is charged with Apple and Microsoft companies for the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft's company, so much Buffett, but he wouldn't want to show up.
The founder of Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The threat is massive
After the discovery of "Bunks in Zwickau" the Turkish media are suspicious of the German legal state.
The news is even talking about "blood ideology" which is now alive.
There were always eight small companies of Turkish origin and one Greek in the years 2000 to 2006 with a fairly extreme background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany, the report was answered with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German Turks, it was a long-standing threat to the dead: Since the January attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a legitimate extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobic in Germany has never been any doubt about it.
However, the right-wing extremism network has declined, which has long since been unable to take account of its dimensions.
"Is He Living Blood Ideologies Again?" The headlines of the online release of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" news points out, however, that one of the prosecutors should be a secret police officer of the institution for the protection of the constitution and fear that German authorities could also be involved in a legitimate radical base.
The Turkish citizen of Germany responded with a strong response: She recalled the weekend of demonstrations of silence before Brandenburg's defense of the victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish citizen of Berlin, together with the German and Turkish policies of the 15th anniversary of the German-Turkey assembly agreement, reminded the citizens of Berlin.
In joyful colours, a common life was symbolized - as history of success.
As a lawyer here, several Turkish media reports: "Darek Germany for the past decade" is an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the "Hürriyet" list for Germany will not take place in order to prevent this intellectual connection.
"It's getting started," says the title of the column from Ahmet Külahci.
It highlights the fact that people who paid taxes and their work have been killed have made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in the German cyberspace police procedures and its late success in patroling.
Why the German authorities have not been able to find out much earlier so that after suspected patrols in the right extremistic circles, the authors are surprised.
So many are at least retortively ready to use the drastic means: "If the activity continues to be so superficial, it will not force migrants to do anything other than their own defence and arms".
"It'll be about the best self-defense."
"The quality of the explanation and adaptation of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany," says "Selen."
What it means, if internal peace is threatened in Germany, they explain the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
Photography of the fireplace in Solingen is a deep hole in the memory of Germany and Turkey.
Because there was no other event that made it clear to the Turks living here that there is a massive threat here and to the Germans that they can not trust and leave in the right way.
However, the attacks on the Turkish side made them feel closer to each other.
Do Not Repay Past Mistakes
The Turkish press was particularly criticised by the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Möln who had survived.
After the January attack in Solingen, he sent a series of telegrams to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkele - Kinkel, at the time in his exhibition, to calculate the costs of Turkey's buildings.
Just like the value of a person is measured according to the height of his tax.
The current reporting of Turkish media once again shows how deep is the distrust of many German Turks in the long-term state-law order.
According to the effort to clarify and reassess the legitimate extreme terrorism in Germany this time requires open words.
Scandal bank in the Curysian lake
The best bank in Europe has no seat in Italy or France, of course in Switzerland.
Βn has been suffering from a financial crisis almost bankrupt and has since been from one crisis to another.
Now it's got some German to compare.
So Axel Weber probably didn't think about it.
Following its sudden departure from the lead of the Bank of the Bank, it became known in July that 2013 would be in almost the same spectacular new employment: the President of the Swiss Grand Bank of BB - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber welcomed the public, commended Switzerland for its beauty and MB for its new solidarity and said friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"The U.S. has been working on it."
I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villager and Oswald Gribel.
But it was clear in the harvest that everything was totally different.
A dealer from BBL in London destroyed all bank security systems and lost about EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the show, Oswald Grübel, not only a known banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the Governing Council of BB is also as well - and all ask: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It's been known that Weber's bank has been working since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Governing Council will now take over in May - not until 2013 as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it'll be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a more economic teacher and an emission banker, and he'd certainly need a time to work.
We will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title "Banca of Europe's biggest scandals"
However, BB is huge - until recently she was the biggest asset manager in the world - and has been running from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to be left to the proud Swiss bank.
It started with a financial crisis.
In 2007, BBB used excellent stories.
The image of a silent and solid but also intelligent asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: she wanted something to mean in investment banking.
Thus, BB 2007 was one-sided with $1.6 billion more money from potential customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she acted as an investment bank into the league of the largest world banks
That was an idea.
An ex-banker and a later long-term banker in Curychu Hans Geiger reports: "I always introduced BB to my students at the time as a model of good banks."
"From today's point of view, man asks: How could I have been so wrong?"
He made a big mistake.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something in the U.S.
In half of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of the exhibition, who has been awarded a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was relieved of why he left.
The Bank's investment division has broken the Subprime paper and has to sign billions.
To stop it, she announced a BB's increase in capital at a real cost of 13 billion francs.
So she really found investors, even such as she would have recently buried her nose: an unscathed Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so discreet that no one knew its name.
But it was just the first shot.
In December 2008, it developed higher.
The Bank had to acknowledge new billions of losses, President of the Governing Council Marcel Ospel, 2006 and another of Switzerland's most successful governance councils, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster was following: BHB was taken into account by its misinvestment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank has purchased from BBT ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs on a mandatory exchangeable bond for which it could become a joint bank.
The whole of Switzerland was torn apart - because it saw how dramatic it is for a small country when it has so large banks in its territory.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet was more than five times greater than the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save another BB," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is related to the second.
For several months she had been chapterling BB in a tax dispute with America and she had been willing to issue potential customers who, if possible, paid taxes.
It also agreed with the payment of $780 million - such as the recovery of illicit profits from these transactions, including counterfeiting.
She found out more or less BB was helping to reduce the tax.
At the same time, she lost something that she had given up on her capital in competition with rich customers: a saint of discretion.
After this scandal, Switzerland's bank secrets were no longer what it used to be.
It followed the resignation of the Head of Mission and the President of the Governing Council.
And exodus customer money.
The bank thus lost its probability within several months in both central trading areas: in investment banking due to miscellaneous speculation and in managing property to help reduce tax.
And just when it got a little bit quiet again, just when it was thought that the U.S. was going back, this unfortunate business anabbey came up here: The only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank warned that something was wrong.
And that's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it's probably still not true.
"In the case of Adoboli it is likely that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and a finance professor at the Bank University of Zurich.
The financial director of the major German banks is also certain: "The problem of BB is that he does not control the risk."
In addition, this was exactly the idea of caution, which the Swiss bankers had long before been able to become observers of the world's major assets: there was no too much risk, so security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic was once again ruining the world.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become a symbol of unwavering independence such as Lindt and Spungli for particularly quality chocolate.
The center of BBB in Curych is still going to a very good Swiss private bank - it's only a bit bigger.
It's classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Kurish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curysian lake, which is surrounded by snowcapped peaks of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the purchase of businesses belongs to the highest in Europe.
Clenonicity like Tiffany's is here between Swiss traditional trades like sugar Springs.
The Swiss banks are already living here for centuries: from Nationalbank via Palast der Credit Suisse and from elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall shall be entered by the hard rear door.
Inside they seem to be covered with marble, before them are possible skin crests, next to the logo of the bank's large guide to "seyfu".
Βn knows what a customer here is looking for: security.
This idea of Swiss banks both Swiss big banks, BB and Credit Suisse, however, have sometimes failed or betrayed, as the chief of one small Swiss private banks finds out.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he finally closes up like all Swiss bankers, as well as with both big business banks.
It seems that it has grown too much, it finds out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxians have expanded.
The Swiss don't seem to have anything to say about it anymore.
"And if so, they've been adapted to long-term English ways."
In fact, this was the Anglo-Banconomy that changed BBT, leading to its first high profits and then to the collapse: No European financial institution has lost as much money as Swiss Grand Bank in the jungle around the Subprime.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"In the middle of that year, the government coalition of small seven million land was founded on the largest saved action in the history of its nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "Der BHB-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save from the bank's bank.
How could that be?
If he's talking to Swiss bankers, you see a problem, especially in the size of BB.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined the potential group.
There was a bank that was already too large for small Switzerland - and still grew.
It also helped to complement the two different bank precedents of BB: One rich, but the bank in Curychu with difficulty in managing property and poverty, but more internationally involved.
The internationalisation of investment bankers came right here for a lot of money that they could solve a large roll.
With this rise, two names are linked: Peter Wuffli, chief of the BB and Marcel Ospel from 2001 to 2007 and then the President of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of futures," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffley, the highly intelligent, humble man who knows so much about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages to feel around the stomach that he developed from banking science all up."
But Ospel was finally relying on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably let go of the decisive mistakes: "If he thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The storm has passed.
The staff of the BBB clearly remember the comments of the leading staff on which the chief of the company Wuffli kept repeating the same password: Srazit Goldman Sachs from the bottom of the throne.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She introduced "League Tables", an officer who documents the success of the bank at that time.
She was trying to get the BB up there.
A few steps have already taken her.
In business with dividends and shares, the games went up completely.
However, the subordinated consultants who were trusted highlighted one weakness: In international trade, in terms of banks "Fixed Income", there seems to be a large gap between the largest banks.
He's probably got measers in American hypothetical products.
In order to close this measure, BBF agreed to the welfare that would almost continue to exist.
Cold after growth, both the bank and its own funds were invested in insurance risk to the American Subprime investments.
She was involved in a possible machine that ran out of valuable papers on American mortgage loans and passed on - while leaving her risk alone.
Also when other banks have long been looking for the east.
"In 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, BB bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
As big as euphoria, it's so big.
One manager had to leave behind when his attempts to calm down were more difficult than he thought.
The positions in the U.S. had become a catapulting seat, and today they hope.
Whoever's driving the big bank right now, he's got almost an uncontrollable job.
It has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all nearby business models.
Banking expert Geiger already has the idea: End with investment banking, asset management concentration, return to Swiss roots.
The bank of the network (not yet) wants to go away.
But investment's got to be very strong, so clear now.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually understood only as a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke up with the predecessor of Grübel.
In the meantime, he had a long time to transport BB, which was sent by the Kurish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank back to its position in half of the 1990s.
3500 square places.
But that won't be enough.
Β needs a visit.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking now.
But he's still just saying his wife's going to live in Curych.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs the burgue in the United States.
The threat of recession in Europe has saved American investors from the start of the week.
The change of the government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the expected positive effect.

The Italian and Greek glass in the last week was still placed in half full, or half empty - now but there were problems again, Mark Luschini from Janney Montgomery Scott said.
In particular, financial values remained on sales lists.

The subcontractors produced two per cent less than the month before, as reported by the Eurostat statistical office.
"We're no island, we're probably dependent," said Steve Goldman from Goldman's management.
Europe will probably not leave the recession as soon as possible, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The theory of investment Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in one CNBC interview that it would probably not be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
It is therefore likely that from his point of view it is too soon to invest in European State loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the old principle for decades and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM increased the course of the traditional group's action and allowed it to go against the trend during the trading process for almost one percent higher.

Intelligent walls expand in cities
In many places there is a cavern full of "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals have long been unable to pop out of the city, says experts.
One likes them, the other likes to get rid of them quite quickly: The streets are already part of the city after centuries, although in some cities the population is getting into trouble with the unclean and highly affected animals.
There's no way against the "problem birds" yet to monitor any means.
Havrani's full probably can't get out of town anymore, experts announced at the first exhibition on grapes in East Africa Leer.
There experts from the entire community consulted on possible east-easterly areas.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
Naturalists also removed the city’s problems from the exodus of protected caverns in particular: The use of chemicals in agriculture almost to an increasing extent leads to the destruction of traditional areas of life.
The pursuit, the growing plant and the cutting of typical trees for hunting birds are life-threatening.
The doors are protected.
A large colony with more than 600 nesting pairs are among others in the West Falcon Soesta, in the northwestern, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Brem and Leer.
There he called for a 2005 mass killing project of a negative title in the foreign period.
Critics marked the departure of animals into the bird feed and killing cactus, especially brutal.
"Normal eviction, fear, nothing can happen," so did the urbanist and Ukrainian Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of iron by spraying water or cutting trees often has unpleasant consequences, said the expert at the Manfred Kaiser living environment from Lahru in Badensk-Württemberg.
"The animals go away, the great colonies climb up and divide into other places."
Fear is only thought of as an exception to hospitals, homes of pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them. We can't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the city can't solve the problem, was the observation of Wolfgang Kellner of Leer's age.
It is thought that the combination of animal excavating from sensitive residential areas and their additions is necessary to accommodate other places.
"The information table instead of the retex pill" promoted this psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for the whole other behavior of animals: "We can finally stop with our own consciousness."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's scientific death course, which provides information on the life of the highly intelligent shark.
The project is about to be accepted by tourists.
On the other hand, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion on the critical nature of the birds: "This is where every volume of communication has a lot to say."
The intelligence and complexity of animals are legendary: Havarni fillers do not only use help to get memory, although even as a help to their tool is finished.
Researchers at Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four havarins as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In one experiment birds quickly learned that the stones must bring the building together so that they can get into a bow.
Without a large trainer, they knew what size and shape must have a stone to cause collapse of the plates.
In the second attempt, the anointed ones had to solve a more delicate problem.
In the war that was fought at all, researchers have placed a small supply of paint paint.
Apparently, the birds couldn't reach their advantage.
All the researchers put their hair on their back.
From them she created all four animals of prey, using it as a hunter to catch prey from a trapper.
Three of the four full-fledged sharks were even hit.

Massacre at personal level
A powerful new book called The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War is starting with a long list of exhibiting positions when you are covered by it.
One advice to keep at this time: Delete this page carefully and make a backup from it.
With all the people, you are well aware of Mr. Englund's Romana, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a mother - at times when you will feel the same as men and women in the history of the world in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new residence at the Swedish Academy, which shares Nobel’s price for literature.
The book we're dealing with here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, almost as "an antihistoric work".
It contains a number of very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, but it almost lacks officials, energy journalists and debate on tactics and equipment.
It's not even so much a book about what happened that explains the author as "the book about what it was." It's mainly about "feels, ideas, experiences and skills".
"The beauty and charm" in itself combines the war experiences of 20 more men and women with less tutuktual men and women, on both sides of the barracks, from students and botanists to watch, doctors, drivers of rescue and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, will come to an end, will commit fornication or die.
Their lives are mixed like flames of candles burned in the church - new ones are added to the website of the courts while others are disturbed.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classical historical novels.
It manages the idea that the first world war was only about terrible underground battles on the Western front.
"Greas and charms" is a handy search for other places where she played war dramas: Alpine, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve the problems of having snowflakes fall on them, have to spend Christmas on the pyramid stage or compete with the presence of mice.
Almost since the beginning, it's about very clever reading.
The flag will bury people like some natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina flying through the flames.
If you start shooting at your work in the distance and you're a woman who's home with her children, will you run away or stay?
Who's really getting close?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war has been resolved.
"The vacuum caused by lack of facts," noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with events, ideas, hopes, fears, premises, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fashions."
"The beauty and charm" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmbrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumff, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are everywhere translated from living letters, letters, and other material already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and terrifying, but thanks to the introduction of small moments and details, they are quite alive and reliable.
Many of them agree on working and comparing with him.
In the history of the German student, the author says, "The prizes, the same prizes everywhere."
"A cup of coffee, similar to a stove, rubber imitation, paper coatings, wooden buttons."
It's still going on and describing food supplies in Germany.
It is referred to as "mass made of liquefied rice cooked in a cup of copper (and supplemented with a false bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried broths, bottled with wood.
It states that there were "837 registered fatty acids in the manufacture of parks and 511 registered coffee fats".
Some stories are about respect and dignity.
One American finds internal motivations for divorce and brutality and says about the war: "At last you will understand that this is exactly human nature. Never sit in comfortable crystals with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good book, and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that I am not hiding any color in the nitre."
On the other hand, the British soldier realizes that with the greatest likelihood of death, he will soon die and no one will even notice it because he has broken it.
"When a person finally agrees with being sacrificed, he would at least expect this to happen before the air of the grateful public," he writes.
Instead, however, it seems like "the judge who holds secret. "
Other notes relate to the departure of old Europe and the introduction of new threats.
"The more the conflict became an economic competition and a competitive struggle," Mr. Englund writes, "a lot of companies."
He caught up with what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a verbal and ideologically
People act unexpectedly, and the subterraneans agree with pride.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch up with the prostitutes in order to avoid their service at the front.
"The most difficult example of this behavior was the trade with the gonocox knife that soldiers bought and sold to him in hopes of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"The most reliable ones have hit him in the eye, which has often been blind to the end of life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Mr. England's dust is fresh, but it doesn't show up, which is very good for his human subject.
In dozens of minors, it captures the way in which the war "has dealt with uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolutions, religious hatred".
People start to wonder why their leaders are fighting.
The best books about the first world war were mostly more complex than with complex interpretations, such as "First world war and modern memories" by Paul Fussel or Romans as "On the Western front" by Erica Marii Remarquea.
Mr. Englund's giving priority to non-conventional food.
His book has the most exciting endings that there are no periods in popular scientific literature.
But I won't betray him to you.
However, you will seem like an author jumped out of the book, kicked your page with a list of gloves from your hands and burned it.
After the previous error this time in a minute exactly planned
Hundreds of police participated in her, some of whom were used in public toilets.
On Monday night she was chosen because it was time for the Zuccotti park to be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officials.
In front of the action, police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases should not be repeated in the last weeks when, for example, the use of pipe arrests against demonstrators, which violated the rules of division, and the public sympathies were passed on to the squatters.
It was therefore a police operation aimed at cleaning Zuccotti's park from demonstrators, starting up to two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were allowed to inspire operations carried out in other cities.
Massive training for crisis situations took place in Randalls Island, which was prepared for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have strengthened such training for non-peace escapes - anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police - focusing on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The instructions to move to the park came from the text "at the last minute" to someone whose action was originally explained only as "training".
"I know a few police officers who were also invited to this action, and no one certainly told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he remained in anonymity.
"As to going to Zuccotti Park, they knew only the highest membership of the department."
One of the reasons for the arrest was the lesson that the city had already received.
On 14 October, representatives of the cities were to clean up the park plan, but then they arrived from the plan, because when the demonstrators heard of it, they were gathered before the start of the operation into the park for hundreds of years.
The second action was attended by police from various units, including practical groups from all over the world - dozens of police officers who are often used to strengthen the fourth with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people are coming to the park and coming back, so one hour of the night was the perfect time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to carry out this at a time when at least people would be in the park," he declared.
Before the units appeared, they were arranged along the streets of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, freight cars of emergency units with flammable lamps and amplions.
The light and written message burning from many demonstrators scared.
When members of the order units entered the park in their modern windmills, many demonstrators threw their things away and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 a.m. she didn't reach the only state she wanted to give demonstrators time to change things.
Other police teams were taken to gather at the end of the park in order to escape if any arrests were needed.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief speaker of the police department, Paul J. Browne, said it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, hold that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and some police were also rude to her.
Mr. Browne said that television cars at the Church Street leading part of the western boundary of the park could be identified without problems.
The police acted in the western direction, and were very busy with personal protesting things, including engagements and needles full of clothes. The team from the hygienic department immediately recovered everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documenting image material appeared some time later on the Internet.
The largest group of protesters fled to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some created arrests, and the police started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the camp center joined each other.
And two people were bringing themselves to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the preparatory services were invited to cross the gates.
Until 3:30 a.m. no arrest took place in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, a police statement was made.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "the organisation of the market and the storage of the defence during the arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest formed uniformed officer in the department.
The operation also participated personally with Phil T. Pulaski, director of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police were waiting on the east side of Broadway between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be allowed.
On the Cortlandt Street street, block north of the park, and on the Pine Street street, block south of the park, were tied to the fences.
From these places, the police then developed a security passport further away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police were interviewed, many of which were equipped with protective equipment, as people still press outside this border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The most amazing action of the night has taken place south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, a demonstrationist was taken south of Pine Street as he jumped on the police car cap, and several others who released the air from pneumatic police supplies.
One minute from the dose, he flew out of the cane.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protestant were hospitalized.
The Committee of Assistant Workers will appeal to the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants who have come to work last month are planning to complain about the city. He claims that there was no need for the release and there was no discrimination due to an unmeasurable impact on schools that visit poor students.
The Court of Justice is likely to be the last option left to the District Council 37 committees in their efforts to reverse the exemption decision.
On 7 October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who were among the most highly paid city employees lost their jobs.
The city's representatives rejected this categoryal charge.
At a meeting of the City Council last month, Minister of the University of Dennis M. Walcott said the discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council immediately argued that there was no specific reference in the budget to the absence of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would complain about them.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be sued in the process, while the complainant will have eight unemployed workers, all of whom are Africans or Hispanics, like most of the other assistants who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen a complaint, and therefore it will not appear to be a single charge.
According to the New York Times proposal of the difficulty in obtaining New York Times, the committees focused on the number of people left behind in poor parts of the city who wanted to support their claims on unfair treatment. They also hold that poor schools have come to more assistance because they have long been supported by sufficient financial resources.
They show that while schools in Staten Island did not leave at all and in Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, District 23, in Brownsville, 17 school assistants and in Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx, even 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that at school Public School 36 in Harlem lost five out of eight assistants, although it is about school where 68% of students live in poverty. The complaint says: "It is not about the presence of full-time mobile parents who can provide financial resources to balance the deficit."
The number of Public School 36 schools has been reduced by 3.26 per cent this year and the school has also come about money when the city has changed the method of calculating bonus finance for each registered poor student.
In addition, the Committee claims that the head of secondary schools could be removed in a way that had been written by a document approving the absence of parental coordinators.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, and thus delete the position, although this word is often used to describe the transfer of teachers from the school payroll to the available staff database, which may be played by the central authority.
"Six hundred parental coordinators have been released," says the proposal of complexity, "and no one has just moved to the database at the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to agree on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the convention agree on something about the rise in Libya.
Before that came, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time ruling dictator Muammar Kaddáfi had to be arrested and killed and part of the United States unit was terminated.
The Commission on International Relations with the Senate will decide on the statement by President John Kerry (Mass.) to join Senators John McCain (Aris.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans for their successful rise to the United States.
"In this statement we want to assess the plight of the Libyan population who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These verses may seem innocent, but there is no debate on Libya until it was ever easy.
Over the years, legislators from both sides have continued to agree with the White House on the amendment of the order of declaration for approval or refusal of the United States military role in NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented resolutions that allowed the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Treaty because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
On the same day that this proposal was rejected by the Chamber, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop financing American operations in Libya.
The United States Mission in Libya has thus read a text in the legislative cleaning – Congress has criticised the way President Obama's mission is directed, but his members obviously did not want it so much that they could stop supporting him at his beginning.
The convention was finally scheduled for another event.
The rebels got Tripoli in August, and on October 20, he killed Kaddáfi.
Miss Nato officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "Thanks the citizens of Libya for their immeasurably bravery and outstanding restraint that they have exerted in their efforts to free their people" and "thanks the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have taken part in the operations for the protection of Libyan citizens, for their extraordinary state and professionality."
The declaration also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Is there a new proposal full of support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be redivided into two-halfs, as it was when the red proposal was approved?
In response to the last version, Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), Chief Representative of the Republican Party, was appointed to the Commission.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that the final version of the new proposal had not yet been seen.
This week will vote in favour of an addition to the Constitution which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, sponsored by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution relating to the budget or other subject to which the whole of the Treaty or the Senate will be voting.
The other legislators have not been able to push their proposals to their own vote, even through considerable effort.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of the 68 additions to the composition presented at the convention and covered a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to the Senate - and others are only minor exchanges.
Only at least 15 versions can be found in the Snīmāmīmānā, which would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are very sensitive, but their residents - particularly the beginning republicans who want to improve their history - can be grouped by their "authority".
The draft budget regulation adopted in August required that Snemovna and Senát vote on the addition to the balance sheet.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of an unconditional declaration in support of the origin of such an addition.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to report a limited number of periods during which members of the Congress may serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods to which the President may serve.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole series of supplements that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an addendum prohibiting marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition prohibiting the burning of State flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the States are against them.
Although the members of the Congress appear to be very active in proposing various additions, compared with the previous years, they do not significantly deviate from the average.
At 111. 77 additional items were offered at the convention, while at 100. These were 66.
Their activities are even worse than the beginning of the 90th century when, according to statistics, the Senate members offered more than 150 extras every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than modern politics.
The last addition which was added - 27th - was ratified in 1992 and was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Dear but not broken," says Gifford in his first radio conversation with the shooting
Ten months after she was shot by a fireman at a public meeting with a voter in Tucson, Gabrielle Giffford (Ariz.) appeared on public television on Monday evening, singing along with a melody from the "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" broadcast "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than a return to Congress is needed for her to get well.
Giffords appeared in the order "20/20" at ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of the world still makes her problems and needed help in the race.
All the while, she documented her difficult reconnaissance, which was necessary because of the damage caused by the bullet that had hit her before, she had a left half brain and left her head out.
Three months ago she was surprised to return to Snow in order to attend the vote on the debt table three months ago.
During his first television interview with the gas bomb, during which six people were killed and the other 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed, and sang - while his recovery was described as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 14-year-old Gifford answered, "All right."
The conversation with Giffords and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 hour special feature of the series, which was sent on the evening of the release of this couple's new book, called "Gabby: History of Hope and Hope".
The special was following the whole Gifford's reconvalescence from the 8th of January.
On the videos that Kelly discovered during the first week is to see Giffords in hospital beds with his head covered and long neck.
While her husband wakes her up, she can't do more than one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Gifford is arrested as he sits in a wheelchair and the therapist teaches her how to perform simple tasks.
Headache.
It's an explosion of wounds.
And then her first word, "Co."
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she asked for changes in her breakfast.
The video posted by ABC shows that the challenging role for the preservation of Gifford's songs is music: The Congressman sings them together with the song therapist "Girls Just Wana Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who spends two hours each day on therapy, Sawyer found that he doesn't remember anything from the day he got shot.
Her husband said Gifford had read news articles on the shooting until 12 March, when she first asked who was the six who were killed in the incident.
From the shooting is suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is held in the Missouri prison, where under the influence of violent drugs he is waiting for trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Serious, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that his wife said one moment during the reconvalescence, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly wrote.
"You just got a hug.
But you'll do it, you'll get together, and you'll get back stronger than before."
Military units meet more than one-hundred-and-one
This event was a Wall Street war veteran who spent millions of dollars on war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ball of weakness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, mariners, pilots and mariners ran around him.
A well-dressed tax arose and overloaded.
"The men and women serving in the army were considered to be heroes," said David Saltzman, who arranged for garden benefits.
The chairman of the Committee of Heads of Staff also attended the festival evening. In addition to him, an admiral Mike Mullen was present, who, however, saw the role of military units in something different.
"They were all represented as some poor people," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought so well.
I know you do.
Just what I saw wasn't worth it.
Thus, in a rather negative way, only illustrate the narrow relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes glorifying the American public.
The army is included without exception in praise of its victims.
As long as Dad's praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public keeps acting more and more like the only one in the uniform.
"We're not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who was a lot of units in Iraq and who will soon leave Afghanistan.
"Because it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or to show off their relationships with the public that they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face while returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of mercy are spoken in silence and in secret between war veterans.
When two sons of the retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from the fighting operations where they served as members of the Navy, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at them from two angles.
Some will feel respect and wonder because they have defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
On the other hand, he'll turn his head if "there's no hidden evil under the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the wars in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government after his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who had talked to him suddenly pointed out whether he could cope with the stress associated with work in Washington so soon after his return to the war.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the army partly stems from American hostility to war.
The success of the battle field is only a small fraction of the recognition in the country, which has only little knowledge of its own army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is only a little of its own advantage.
"As a nation we no longer consider military dignity as usual for the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who was very much involved with American units in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are appointed for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to stand firm against rape
This week it will decide whether 28 women and men will be brought to trial because of certain inactions in the event of rape.
If not, they are ready to submit a complaint to hundreds of other bidders.
Elizabeth Lyman's first class was on the night she was reportedly raped by her army mate for 25 years and was on the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she went to the casino on the plane base of Miramar north of San Diego. After dinner, she met her boyfriend with a 12-pike boyfriend.
He asked her if she could join her so they could have a little drink in her room.
"In my head, I've got a bright light," wrote Lyman.
So Texasan's parents completely ignored her intentions.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
He says that just a few minutes after they got into her room, her husband passed her by, took her to bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a hearing hearing that might have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will discuss whether the charges against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld have been involved in the fight against the proliferation of violence in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was filed by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the complainant had 17 members at that time. However, during the following months, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their fellow members in the army and that the army, following the announcement of these attacks, was subjected to investigation, harassment and any assault on justice.
Burke says he's going after the church with the highest-ranking military leaders because the problem is just starting with them.
"The army is a directive system," she says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors from the Union, many of whom could become part of other future complaints.
Her strategy: More than to collect all charges in this case - she put all the eggs into one basket, as she says - makes her complaint in several different cases if it is necessary to keep the pressure from falling.
The Defence Service team is led by the representatives of the United States of America, Neil MacBride, who, together with its staff, has contributed to the refusal of the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek detailing the strategy of provocation - in principle it is not possible for modern or former soldiers to complain of injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the Regulations of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Serving injuries are related to the military services of the complainant," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to express its concern.
However, things have changed over the past 15 years.
Although women are still not officially able to serve in the fight, it is only about saluting: in modern wars it can only be difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers continued to play an even more important role, especially in the field of communication with civil women emerging in the war zone.
The result: between these wars there fell 150 women's soldiers - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization to take place in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her struggle, except for three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law Schools, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services are preparing applications for four major military academys for the development of a dominant atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
In spite of this, the U.S. Vietnamese veterans' organization gathers the basis for its complaint against the army. This claim focuses on the diagnosis of "person abuse", which was apparently found in the victim's victim of rape so that the army would have a basis for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagatio's belonging to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, it is a very common practice.
Her group had already filed a complaint against the State organisation for dealing with a veterinary medicinal product accused of discriminatory practices to which the application for assistance from persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted.
The Congress presented nine separate proposals submitted by a group of senators and envoys from both political parties and proposed a series of corrective measures throughout them.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases and according to Pentecostal estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
In a report published in March, there is also a level of criminalization of suspects: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army - half of which were contrary to the civil justice system.
In the case of Burke's representatives, the complainants describe the attacks only as the first of the whole series of traumatized.
For example, the first class of Lyman reported a certain violence against the military police less than an hour after he had to come to it.
During the night, she said, she was asked to pack her details of her rape with a dozen different police officers, doctors and leaders.
She submitted all the tests necessary for the determination of rape and found the blood of the attacker in her bed - from the wounds she had taken care of.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman’s hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she had fell in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned who as witnesses of the story were told in the benefits of a certain lawyer who was finally forgiven.
"I will remember the day when the judgment was delivered," says Lyman.
"I had to feel that I was born right there - with a cry I ran away from the judge's son."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my superior, "It wasn't his judgment. It was mine."
The Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder that identified her as unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without any respect and, therefore, no compensation for the benefit.
Whether Lyman's case or not is going to another phase or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University.
However, she notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to take up further stages of the delivery."
However, among them and among them are the above-mentioned doctrine, which has been criticised since the first time that the light of the world has seen.
I'm the life-threatening critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army has been behind for several decades because their obligations are not able to maintain the same level of motivational and fear - inspiring resources.
He adds, "The chances are tough against them... but it's important for them to try it."
Only when good people are willing to fight will they change.
In the absence of a decision in their favour, Burkevo, the complainant, shall collect hundreds of other persons prepared to submit the application and shall work on other reasons relating to this matter.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue until it comes to reform," he says.
Or until we die, according to what happens before.
They have eyes: How scientists test you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-terrorist views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the Russian murderous rage after which 77 dead people were killed in Norway, participated in his first public hearing.
Although Brevik could be alone, he was certainly not alone in the cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer during the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the rights group on social networks.
After this year's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
So how can I find them?
Easy - it's enough to express on Facebook.
"We realized that it is, in fact, not so difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report from the British research team on European digital populism.
The range of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have simply used advertising on sites and because of this, they have clearly identified the wanted demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team has found half a million fans of legal groups, focusing on them and sending them inserates. However, instead of calling them into new groups or offering them some diet products, they called for the audience to meet questions about their level of education, violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - without even having to leave the office.
"It's a completely new way of carrying out research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online standing groups are everywhere young men who are promoting a growing rate of mobility.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who keep hiding behind the screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends that cover up-to-date status updates, air contributions and printed "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data on a daily basis, making from this social network the text "information supernova", which is developing a lot of new research. The number of academic works in which Facebook is published has grown to around 800% over the last five years.
For some scientists, Facebook insisted that it gives people the opportunity to study without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"In the past, it was very difficult to identify them when you wanted to conduct an investigation among people from the British National Party."
"You'd have to get to the side where you'd never be left," says Bartlett.
"It's all on Facebook - you're just going straight to it."
Others claim that the website can offer a way to identify and avoid social health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who collected their training courses on Facebook were much more at risk of alcohol problem than students who were silent about this subject.
Moren suggests that students of the site monitor and come with the help of students who publish too many public status.
"The problem can't be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Children's Development at the Child Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify threatened children that we should otherwise not be able to identify."
Facebook itself continues to probe the data of its users.
The information team developed statistics on the relationship status of Valentine's Day, the voluntary participation in 2010 and the national peace rate (mainly with the use of the information they had access to - the residents of the Internet Freedoms claim that the website should have access to research and others for a long time).
But Facebook users know that the site is following whether they like it or not - instead of having a chance to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site should provide its personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data are available to everyone.
"I don't think most of the users didn't even think that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study that he conducted with the use of public facebooks of his students.
"If it's about them, they read it so that there's only information between them and their friends."
The following is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even in the off-line research there is no guarantee that the entity is quite honest.
On Facebook there is no way to check how much information on the profile and the wall contributions are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two very different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that pregnancy and writer still remains the best tool he can use in research.
"When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that won't be replaced," she says.
"Societal research should be about society and social activities - and a lot of social activities are still playing off-line."
"Church and Negede": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to two attacks during which 77 people were killed this year in Norway during his first public hearing in Oslo himself described himself as a "warman".
"I am a military leader in Norway's resistance campaign and between the Norwegian temple knights," he declared before the court, where 500 people were assembled.
"I am referring to the Court of Justice because the mandate has been made to you by organizations that promote the ideology of hate and that support multiculturalism."
"I know my actions, but I don't confess any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he didn't want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could vote his views."
For the same reason, he refused to give Breivik, who brought with him a ready word, to allow at the end of the hearing to carry out his sacrifices.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, forbade him any media contact for 4 weeks and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence within eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 native victims and survivors.
Some came in hopes that they would be able to look into the eye of Breivik, others to make sure that he was held firmly under the trap.
All were involved with the purpose of moving the case to a rapid closure.
"It seemed to me that he seemed cold and nened," said NRK commentators one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't a pleasant thing, but I can say to myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I moved back and again mentally."
Breivik, in dark dress and blue tie, remained calm and professional all the time. On arrival and leaving the building without trouble looking for the present journalists and living in the eye.
Despite Breivik's surprise that he was part of the larger "refuge" campaign, the judge found that he was not crazy and noted that there was no evidence that he had any partner.
For someone it may be a relief that the 22 June attacks seem to be the work of the only extremist and no radical group.
However, this automatically does not reduce the wear and tear that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I'd like it to look like a creature that isn't like that," said one of the victims.
"If so, it would be much easier."
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Job in the film aimed at quin this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5th, people who compared him to Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius as the greatest modern researcher.
At a recent reopened Job's interview, which was released for a special film that aims to win this week, it will be for all fans of Apple's company the fact that his creative thought was perfectly understood by the commercial processes and working flows of his products.
He was a great designer, photographer and self-sustained member of hippie, but also a pedant organizer and man who every detail of the ship to the smallest details - he believed that many businessmen suffer "to assume that the really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between a great idea and a great product is still a long way to work."
In 1995 Bob Cringley worked on TV in the Triumf series of computer jokes, which he agreed on about the world of personal computers. During the race he played a unique, more than an hour conversation.
At that time it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands with his new computer company NeXT, and was impatiently looking at how wide the public will accept the Internet.
Finally, the TV series used only a short part of Cringely’s entire conversation and the original copies of the interview claimed to have been lost during transport.
However, shortly after Job’s death, copies of VHS were found in the director’s garage.
Just this material, peacefully assembled, creates the basis of the 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: Lost interview that leads to the chosen kinses this middle and fourth.
For someone who's been missing his hearing to give further talks, Jobs here seems to be surprised that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it's also seen as a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the discussion, there will be a further pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thought when it is seen how Jobs' answer perfectly reflects to be the most honest and clearest.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism comes to an end when Cringely’s questions are subjected impatiently and encourages him to get to the more important problems and issues.
The conversation was still in progress before Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and there are some awful prophetic ideas in it when Jobs appreciates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the death assessment of Job's career, but on Job's, which we see here as an attractive picture of his genius, is something serious and inspiring.
He has his own vision of how things might and should look.
It didn't last long, and after expressing his thoughts, he also started to apply.
The quick collection of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which are of course worth noting:
How the company learned to manage:
"During years of business, I always asked myself, 'Why do you do this?' And the answer was the same: 'Well, that's how it's done.'
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never think about things about business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple's company.
He was simply confused by the way in which the costs were recorded - often started by the "standard costs", about which he could only think about their height. At that time he decided to express his own way - developed an automatic tool that assured him that they could determine commercial costs for a while.
As he carried out his work on paper:
Jobs mentions "Modrau krabica", which was sistered by Steve Wozniek - a device that enabled people to effectively turn to telephone companies and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
The device was written in the past, but Job’s inspiration when the Modrau crane is described as a powerful tool, it is textable.
Just how they tested with Ozniak the device using a placenta phone and during the conversation they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another, while using the largest number of satellites.
"At least half a dozen times we flew this way around the world, so when we called something into the room phone, it was called a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we found out that we could build on ourselves something that is capable of running the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a little thing that could control a lot more of a bear - it was an incredible experience and I think it would never have happened without Apple.
Jobs continues the description of a joke that was almost brought to an end with Ozniak. In the middle of the night, they called into the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the paper, which seemed to be the best for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, they were allowed to continue their membership of the Catholic Church to speak to the American diplomat during the night, and just before they set up their own paper on the phone, two of them rolled up and sat down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he gave him his replacements so that he could set up a kilometer, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute discussion, Jobs had already had an annual Brigadier-General in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what this company really is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer that was ever made".
He was great like a coward, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager I was doing high and high in HP, I looked around and started writing programs for him.
How innovations mean:
In a few places Jobs is talking about how new products are designed during the conversation.
At the beginning of his career, when he got out selling a couple of cards with a flat connection, one customer asked him to set up a computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid, during which he had to design, assemble, and add equipment.
When he was later in Apple's company, he was reminded of the problems facing computer mouse development:
"I remember how we almost got wild... screaming at me that it would take five years [to set up a 300-dollar mouse] when I stopped playing it, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
As a big company, the rain comes:
Long before bringing up Apple’s company, Jobs apparently predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision would become corrupt and lose their share in the market.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, huh?
You're on the monopol market, so the company can't be more successful.
At this point, they are already able to leave and marketing, so companies are headed by people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are excluded from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led the company to its inexhaustible position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - tools and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox's company...
Xerox could own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
But instead of winning, they won the prize.
How to take innovation as an art form:
"A great idea and a great product is still a long way to go and a lot of work... and as this wonderful idea develops, it changes and grows."
During that time, you learn a lot about him.
You have to access the entire range of compromises - certain things simply do not accept electronics, glass, robots or factory.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and create them together...
Finally, it depends on the experience - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a certain way you try to deny them what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed that I've got the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful that the people who worked in it were outstanding musicians, bassists, artists, zoologists, historians, and even the best computer technicians in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, wonderful things could be done in all other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with the defense of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was brought before the court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors in order to discuss the political controversial question, whether he would adopt an objection to President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the festival dinners sponsored by a legal firm that would be present before the court.
It happened last Thursday, when all nine judges arrived to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases under investigation was a complaint made by 26 states that suspected radical processing of medical care, which was adopted by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
In March, however, a five-hour hearing is expected, with the result of which the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be fully successful.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will try to target the refusal of the law will be with the highest probability Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the federist Group's annual dinners, which has been in conflict with conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trading associations of questionable laws, i.e. the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge financial resources in the process.
She spent several hours at the Washington Hotel after a trial on the subject of the case.
She participated, along with others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republican Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed a copy of the Health Care Act.
What about the introduction of Scalia and Thomas?
There is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society's activities for years.
And it's definitely not even about anything that would be in conflict with ethics rules.
In fact, these judges are free of the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct laid down by the lower federal judges.
If this were not done, however, their conduct would be consistent with the C4 principle, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are directly related and other organisations to obtain financial resources, nor shall the judge be a speaker, fair guests, nor be included in the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two legal companies that are effective in the case, as well as to companies with huge financial interest in this case, has been sufficient to alarm activists who are calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of the code of conduct is in conflict with the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules that it pays for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate for social benefit together with the legal representatives who were waiting for their case to be handled before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining financial means through this action will cover their feet with any claim of non-compliance which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have only shown little understanding to their critics and have shown them that they also combine their judicial duties with the shares of the group, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Gini is a highly established conservative activist.
Conservatives also claim that the ethical problem has mainly been the judge of Elena Kagan and no Scalia with Thomas.
Kaganov worked as a prosecutor general for President Obama's government when the first attempts against the law were made before the court.
Kagan's critics press her to take part in the case and claim that she was fighting so much for the law that she could not be bothered now.
Kagan didn't mean she wanted to quit anyway.
Boeing received a record order for a passenger aircraft worth $18 billion
Emirates Airlines order 50 double-deck Boeing 777 aircraft with 20 other purchase options.
Boeing also sells six-year-old Boeing Dreamliner to Aman Air, which invests more than $1 billion.
When a company gets orders for 50 pieces of its products, most of them have no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is the company's producer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50-years makes a total of $18 billion records, that's something else.
The same important message is from where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, growing in gold for the future orders of the aircraft.
According to the Chinese company's proposal on Monday, it is estimated that medium-term airlines will need $2,520 for the next 20 years at US$ 450 billion.
Boeing announced its greatest order in the history of the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 double Boeing 777.
The sedentary order came from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
The company Boeing announced in 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the option of buying other 20 flights, which would cost US$ 26 billion.
The following Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air aircraft ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which are significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six years is over $1 billion.
"It's an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, analytic for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airports in the Middle East belong to darker nations.
This means that they not only have money to pay for the aircraft but also increase the prices of cheap weights - most damaging airlines because it's one of its biggest costs - it's not so challenging because the country is making itself at higher prices of oil.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to be able to store or print aircraft orders because of the increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," she says.
The Emirates Airline Order guarantees Boeaing’s leading position on the market with a large fleet and leads to Airbus SAS’s bonding company, which sought to break Boeing’s dominant position with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus' representatives announced that it will be withdrawing their first year of A350, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER.
It came to an end because the customers demanded more favourable air loads and landings, so the manufacturer took time to add the engine to the engine's power.
Boeing's share price grew by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The Mexican president's sister was defeated according to everything in mychoacan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, helped the government cross-border drug dealers.
Sister Felipe Calderona seems to have lost the government post in Michocán in violent state elections. The following Monday she announced that one of her opponents helped drug dealers win.
The preliminary results contributed to the conduct of the government elections of Faust Vallej's Western state by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The proportions of members of organised crime in the whole electoral process and in particular during yesterday's own elections are alarming not only for Michocán but for our entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in the radio conversation for the day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion research group... they were playing the polls, they were putting on the road jams... and they allowed people to vote on the order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when it came to the Presidency.
However, the rapid return to power and victory in the elections in Michocán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win in July in presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who was still bringing the day before the elections, just very close.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of his brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to take Vallejona as a winner.
Thirdly, Silvana Aureolis, a candidate for the left side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has so far ruled the government authority. For the divided and violent side, the presidential elections in 2012 are facing a very unhappy outcome.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, refuses any relations with drug dealers and expels other candidates for recognition of the results.
Michocán has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It was about the family state of President Calderon and right in Michocán in December 2006 that a military war against buyers began.
The violence, however, lasted.
The PAN's senior student, Louis Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the elections, and many candidates from the election for fear rose.
However, even if the results of the election in Michocán appear for the PRI party anyway, the victory of the party will help to create a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington Valley, welcomed and said, "I think this victory could be very exciting in view of the coming year."
ADB calls for Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could be a global collapse of the world economy which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, director general of the ADB bank in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything they can" to help speed up the exchange block through the International Exchange Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brussels, Russia, India, China] are monitoring all European problems "too uninterrupted" and said that Asia's financial assistance in combination with European governance and resources will help to bridge the long-term deterioration of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So everyone who could help Europe from the crisis is welcome," said the Financial Times during a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Bombaji.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should do so."
The European Monetary Union has already been subjected to a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy’s cost of borrowing has been dangerously high and the Italian and Greek governments have abandoned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could be re-emerged into recession, and calls are being made to join the new emerging key economies and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag said that all Asian support would be directed through IMF, but he noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of loans from the European Union Fund for Financial Assistance, the institutions for European Financial Stability - would give Asian partners of European countries greater opportunities for reconciliation.
Anand Sharma, Indian trade minister, said that "India will do what it can," to help Eurozone because its own economy now suffers from the decline in export and the collapse of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unsatisfied," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task, and we must maintain a high level of peace of growth."
"It's an alternative, it's a whole fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others point out that developing economies, such as this index, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Warshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to explain political help for Europe 1.2 billion Indians when 800 million of them live with 2 USD or less a day.
"One time they could find out that the Greeks are going to the holiday in the 1950s and are allowed to enjoy the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why there should be indicative resources used to maintain a well-placed employment for many Greek citizens in the badly adjusted and lost sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening "the dangerous dominant effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011/2012 there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia is now facing "risk of collapse" due to European threats.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets must create "unforeseen expenditure plans" in order to protect them against the collapse and the significant impact of capital from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon regarding possible damages in the field of defence
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta at Congress on Monday, he made a good contribution under the box when he warned that the resolution of automatic strikes in the budget could threaten national security and create a financial network response that begins in the Pentagon and continues through the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend this time reducing the budget of US$ 450 billion over the next ten years, but it is now afraid of a reduction of US$ 600 billion if Congress is unable to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The consequences of these drawings would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the Congress to come back to the budget agreement and the so-called standstill resulted in 23% of the phasing-out and many new projects.
"As a result of such a huge reduction, used in this unreasonably fashion, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of buildings or ships. In addition, it could result in serious damage to other modernization forces," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civil servants, and since the reduction has to take place so quickly, we will certainly have to send almost civilians to the nude to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can destroy the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness."
At last the drawings will also be touched by the fighting units, known as Panetta.
"Since the accounts for financing possible military operations in the framework of this facility will not be directly affected, darker operations will be adversely affected by major changes in the other budgets," warned Panetta.
"It will also come into the contractual staff, which will result in delays in contract contracts supporting the military efforts of our people."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent infringements of legal and political support."
The two senators signed up to Pannett ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible effects of automatic shooting on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the stay in the defence ministry could result in a rapid deterioration of the vision of the United States as a world military force."
"We are strictly against this firm measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published the letter of the Pannett.
"It's a conclusion we could live with, and we certainly don't want to sign under it."
"The planned drawings are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It is first to see whether Panett's letter and the clean warning will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of areas cut off.
Panetta has recently been in discussions on possible drawings that are still more open, although he himself has been in his high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving the budgets at Congress and the White House, so he knew that he would fall into a bad fight.
At the press conference, a minute of the week, the Minister of Defence pointed out a detailed picture of what his resort can expect - an army escort inside which there will be a lack of nuclear power.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It'll be like flying without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of emperors, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could finish the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speech in the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without moral, unprepared and unable to match any enemy."
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed..."
In the annex to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how to reduce the consequences of "excessive operational risk: post-crisis reaction, conflict and disaster; significant limitation of the possibility of elevations and exposure around the world; expected unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could wait for the end, including those already tested, even those that were first in early planning.
For example, the F35 flight project, a new bomber planned, a new generation of ballistic ponors, a new coastal battleship and a new ground war vehicle that wanted to replace the army and the marine flag.
By suspending further development and testing of flight F35, it would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that further steps are needed to improve the army, which is necessary to deal with possible threats from China and other rivers.
How to recognize the lie
The annual review of recent news headlines reveals how serious and widespread are lies and deceptions in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full hand to work on the charge that he has been sexually abused by several women - both sides claim that the other is lying.
The board of directors at the University of Penn State was accused of being a secret witness when they tried to hide reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was approached by a microphone saying to American President Barrack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy all careers and block the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself stupid when he published information that was immediately returned with undisputed evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using money from his campaign to try to suppress his unwed balance.
And no one's ever forgotten about the media circus that ran around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinski.
It's just hazy stories about teaching at school and at the university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their own pockets.
Mentors who should be taught again are sending a message that lie and deception is acceptable.
How much do we meet with?
Studies show that in one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are kind lies.
Another study showed that strangers were caught three times during the first ten minutes of the first encounter in life.
Ordering lies or "recognizing lies" is a necessary skill that should be won by everyone, whether for personal or employment reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be like, let's say, Sharad, when a person cries out "I have you." Recognition of the logo is a serious science sector that works with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities during specific research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old lies were returned.
Laughers look at you slowly.
It's not like they're standing up, they're cooking, they're red or they're messing around.
Don't get out of it because it's kind of a hard lie to warn and detect.
The trainee's identification of lies can really distinguish from buildings, small expressions in the face, how to create questions and how to schedule them.
I've spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from the wide and developing field of understanding lies and it's clear that discovering the puzzle is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work responsibilities include renting, ordering conversations, dating or directing people.
Good liars can read well even in others, let them laugh at them carefully, guide their emotions and intuitably know how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverting that men provide more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "targeted to others" - mostly because they protect some feelings - women lie less often to their partners than free people (but they say that most lies are "unharmonic").
We also know that if you are considered a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, note the normal behavior of the entity.
That's what's called the initial observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare.
Note the presence of the body of the entity, his smile, working with the voice.
You should know if someone usually hangs on his feet so you don't falsely accuse him of lying just because he's starting to dig up a hole in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify the gaps of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But Bert is just like a warning signal, not an evidence of a lie.
People who are lying can stop moving up half of the body if they try to remember their imaginary story, they can push themselves to the door, move to the exit, significantly change the body's behaviour or give up the "fly after the end of the conversation" - interrupted by violent breathing and change the position when it is difficult to tell them.
People who are conducting conversations often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end just to see how the wave will look after its completion.
See also the language of the subject.
It's a famous story about how Scott Peterson stopped and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which ran out of national patrol after her body.
The petitioners can also say in a few words: "I did not have any sexual relations with this woman... Mrs. Lewinski" or a very difficult question.
The most common verbatim signs are just very unusual.
Someone can use a lot of "satisfying language" when he answers a difficult question, "Well... let me tell you the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such an answer, we do not find too many facts, and it is often about another warning signal.
There is no universe that would be able to detect every lie, but it is possible to win the skills by means of which lies can be traced.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of finding in his personal and work experience some liar and underprivileged.
Controversy plan for the construction of the rotary hole will be re-directed after the threat of refusal of approval by the US government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to withdraw the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which was respected by the committees but calmed the environmentalists - the company that owned the building announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could move again.
The TransCanada company announced on Monday evening that the planned path is being moved from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills region in Nebraska, and it is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the seat of the Non-Brand Government.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax’s ranks claim that the company is convinced that the construction will eventually be approved, although it will lead to another route.
This notice came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it would reject a decision on the federal authorisation of the project from which it would not conduct a study of possible replacement routes that could not be reached in the Sandhills region of Nebraska and the Ogalala water species.
"This is a real move forward," said the Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological court ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably withdraw any decision by 2013, so the year after the elections next year, the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, both described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed their support.
1 700 miles long attempt will connect Canada and Mexico's oil.
From the province of Alberta to the refinery in Texas, he daily protects 700,000 barrels of oil.
This road will have to reach six states.
This project is simply hate environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who believe that there are 20,000 new jobs at work.
However, the lawmakers in Nebraska adopted this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would lead the company not to reach the Sand Hills region and the Ogalala water species, the main source of drinking water and storage.
The ongoing environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, while a source from the energy industry said that the general inspector from the Ministry had ordered a new review of the entire original study process and focused mainly on two issues.
One was whether the lobbyist hired TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was the adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent the conflict of interest.
In addition, whether the company that was invited to the original study was not chosen incorrectly because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being afraid because of her toll.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle suddenly entered their Manhattan house and scared their daughter out of fear.
The scene of the hit song "Lady Marmalade" frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she endured "changes of personality, sleeplessness" and "an increased fear of strangers," says her family in her complaint to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
On November 10th of the same year, journalist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve, took part in a family trip.
When Kevin Monk got in the car, Roseanna Monk went downstairs to build their house in the riverside Boulevard and brought her and Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and stopped for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind me and said, "You know what your daughter does?" I said "yes" and I went to get her out."
LaBelle's pregnant woman was too late.
"The aggressive tone told me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got upset and started to talk in public. She screamed out the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water with her and started to wait for me.
He claims that Genevieve got hysterical shock.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter." "The mother said to the child.
LaBelle took her mother - who was still in charge of Genevieve - and had to stop her until her delivery, which then drove her to the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the middle of the day, the girl cried so much when she returned home.
Later, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle apologized, but they received no answers.
Lawyers and speakers from LaBelle won't respond to our phones to express themselves for the whole cause.
The complaint calls for closer unexplained damage but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free and that the family plans to hire a charitable organization that is committed to children with cancer.
"The aim is to bring Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is intended against a teacher from a school holding an eight-month-old child."
Climate change has eroded the economy
During the first year of government Maria Lópeze Valdez grew unemployment and independence in Sinaloa, reduced foreign investment and with them also the economy
The year 2011 is recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, which is called the government of change itself. This government has brought great expectation, however, as regards economic progress, because of unfavourable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been noted and has even come to the end of the main indicators of economic development.
The low greenhouse gas emissions caused by the millions of losses in agriculture, hampered the growth of the state economy, have a tendency to reduce economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damages were recorded on 582 835 hectares of processed land, 78.03% of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
The decline in economic activity led to a constant rise in unemployment in the state by November. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased during the first three quarters of the year. From January to March 55,053 Sinaloa was unemployed, representing unemployment rates of up to 4.53% of the active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment continued to grow and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74 000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantese, director of the UAS School of Economic and Social Sciences, unemployment can be explained directly on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of rising unemployment, which relates to various factors. Among them are the loss of liquidity on the market due to restrictions on resources due to legislation adopted by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who are illegally powered by dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them," he stressed.
Stops of migration
López Cervantes pointed out that employment growth is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who go to work abroad, to the United States has decreased, but this is because of the difficulty of entry and then because even though these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get work done. So people stay and demand jobs from our state, and so on, unemployment is growing," he said.
Insolvency
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening due to increasing independence, which prevails in the field of labour conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employees in the state work without taxing social security.
Other characteristics of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and independence. In this administrative area, the lowest payments from the country as indicated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Employment and Social Planning Secretariat.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 peseta, deep under national average, moving to part 7,375 peseta by September.
Short-term direct foreign investment
As a result of the decline in economic activity and unemployment in 2011, the most significant reduction in direct foreign investment in the last 10 years was also noted. According to the Ministry of Finance in the period from January to June, a direct foreign investment of $630,697,674, which represents a reduction of 87.74% of the share of $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government refers to investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year.
Dluh
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be directed to investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to restoring the economy. The local congress approved a loan of over 2600 million pesos. By November no loans were recorded, and this was not recorded in the public economy sector.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of government Maria Lópeze Valdès showed a lack of government leadership.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chambers of the Transforming Industry, said that there was a lack of coordination between individual sectors, including government itself, in 2011.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been extremely unfair during this year. We have to work intensively to get back the land we lost in this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, lack of harmonisation efforts for all of us, and in particular the correct and modernised functioning of this new government. We hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Decrease in the economy
Loredo López pointed out that events such as hate at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and undermined its development and growth.
"The poor economic movement has been caused by a number of events, other than hate. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which was not quickly remembered enough to re-establish dynamics that would enable it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we read deeply under expected forecasts," he said.
Redefinition of the consignment
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employment Confederacy of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is important to point to more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally note that it is working: we believe that a long-term plan should be drawn up which would re-defined the state's objectives and economic direction, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is before us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision of the future that would better guide government efforts.
"I would generally say that the government is trying to achieve good results in different areas, in the field of economic development, some progress has been made, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be private. I can say that it is here to see the work done and I think that the government is aware that there are many jobs still ahead of us," he said.
Paided for 8 kg marihuany
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for eight kilos of marijuana.
The general prosecutor of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of criminal acts of health threats, particularly the arrest of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 at the Cypriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th station in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer was in a white pick up supplier. He had a black bag in his car and on his seat with little boots. The soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the exercise of the legal effects of criminal acts.
Debt contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programmes such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are in danger that they will not be approached to the end or that they will have a lot of delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The city's social development manager said that if construction work has already gone forward, it is now threatened that the government will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funding of more than 11 million pesos on three programmes.
He pointed out that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state is 25%. By this time only the federal and city were added to the work, so it is possible that projects will be delayed.
"They're going to make sure about 12 million and although the year is running out, we've got nothing at all. And even though we've already got a share in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we've started and continued very hard, but we lack money."
He stated that in the London year for the management of Jesús Aguilara Padilla the state did not meet the relevant supplies, so at the beginning of the new period the city had to ask for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million which were not under state administration.
"The same thing has happened to us in the past six years, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued. To get to these programmes this year, we had to get means that would cover what was not done," he explained.
Despite the existence of a pledge by the State representatives concerning the transfer of these resources, he indicated that the request for Armandu Villarreal was sent to the secretaries for administrative and financial reasons to sign the procedure and the corresponding percentage reached as early as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is nearing the end, we haven't even got a dog yet."
The Court of Justice approves "the end of analog shipment" in Mexico in 2015
Reconnaissance of analogue signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional application submitted by Senát and the Senate against the Presidential Decree, which sought to speed up the so-called "exclusion of analogue signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not extend his powers by issuing a decree which included individual steps leading to the transition to the land digital television.
As a result, the complaint submitted by the Senate was rejected, and the fact that no qualified majority of eight votes were reached was necessary in order for the court to express itself to the constitutionality or inconsistency of the said decree which remains applicable.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero, offers an opportunity to declare a decree as constitutional because regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter which is governed by the law of the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofet). It thus violates the principles of hierarchical devices and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the parliamentary Senate supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight against the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero adopted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein leading to the digitalization transition.
The Council of Ministers also decided to reject the application submitted by the honourable Member and not to enter into the discussion on a proposal which is also concerned by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its presentation, the Prime Minister declared that he was not concerned about the arguments of the proposal in the sense that federal execution could not be structured by means of general standards of action to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," he said, adding that planning public policies in strategic areas such as telecommunications sector is a federal executive which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The reward of analogue signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It is thought that to remove the change would mean to remove the benefits from digitalisation which requires decision-making in public interest. Digitalization does not only have a technical dimension, but "it also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of state economic direction, including the whole range of competences which the Charter entrusts to the government of the State".
He noted that the entire number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, although they had highly specialized technical bodies available.
He stated that it is not possible for the Government to bring into the area of administrative compliance with the laws prepared by the legislative powers by issuing a non-conformity decree which, to a certain extent, falls within the scope of the Congress.
In Michocán they analyze the possibility of reading "vote"
According to the data published in the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is 27 per cent. No votes 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" was found in annual elections in Michocán where, according to data published by the Pre-Volume Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the Governor's elections was 27 per cent, and 879 votes from the total 6074 votes were not yet counted.
In this connection, the President-in-Office of the General Council of the Voluntary Institute in Michocán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority had adopted a series of measures which should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As yet to be mentioned, Michocán officially did not endorse its political constitution nor its National Voluntary Code or the Law on Voluntary Justice. The Congress also approved reforms shortly before it had to apply legal deadlines for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel mentioned their publication in the time-limits in the Law of the Official Journal of the State with some intention against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the vote of the head of state in matters of constitutional reform "free and illegal", because he has no right to "no recognition or consent".
On the issue of the possibility of reading "vote" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that it would be possible for the IEM General Council to carry out part-time and overall calculation by the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more ballots will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of counting of votes and the calculation of votes in the relevant section or no chairman is available; or if there has been an error and apparent deterioration of the voter's results.
In addition, the total counting of votes in all ballots will be possible if there is an indication that there is a difference between the potential victory of the vote and the candidate at the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever the oral application of the representative of the party and/or coalition proposed by the candidate at the beginning of the meeting appears.
The total counting of votes will also be possible if, after accurate calculation, it is found that the difference between the likely victory and the candidate at the second place is equal or less than one percentage point and always when there is an express request by the political party whose candidate has ended at the second place. In this case, the ballots will be issued which have been included in the partial reading.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second seats of 0.16% is still not counted, although 129 of the total 923 electoral circles have not yet been counted.
His last wish
His ashes will be broken into the burning bush, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transferred on Sunday night to Saltillo, his home city. During the afternoons, there is a festival ceremony and a toast.
According to the family, his last wish was to be thrown into the burning fiery furnace.
After having had the highest scores, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the main city of Coahuila to the Gulf of Mexico Air Force. The family and closest friends attended a ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the morning, he arrived at the chapel of Nazario Ortiz Garza, where his family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a divorce took place at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which organized its former high school staff and members of the American football team, which was also a member of Felipe Bacio in his early preparations for maturito.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be broken into the burning hell. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot sister.
According to her, she had fulfilled all her hopes, she was at the top of her life, "it was a beautiful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and attended the Collegio del Aire Airport in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream to become a pilot.
His son, George Alberto Dávila Bacio, reminds him of a very good man, "the family came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahakunu to Saltillo."
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zappaan for his uncle's sake, so he was convinced that he died in what he loved most: the management of the plane.
They gave him the last kiss.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, a deputy of the Mexican Air Force, we broke up with all the generations that came to him to be appointed by Governor Jorge Torres López, a citizen and government of the state, a Mexican army through six military zones, the sole Mexican Air Force, leading representatives and students of the Technical Secondary School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he graduated from both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the warlord, who was running, was also a secret officer of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05, the rest of the Saltillensian family Bacio Cortés (completed) arrived to be delivered through funeral services by the Mexican Air Force under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez on the street where his family, his daughter Amanda and his wife, Cristina, mother, relatives and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned bodies were found on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before I was found, the military representatives presented to the media 11 persons who were detained in this area for criminal offences related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was located at 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that chats with a cupboard had time from time to time opened the door.
When they looked inside, about three meters away, they noticed three people dead, so they immediately warned the relevant authorities.
One of the people had a sports shirt of yellow and dark brown shirts and was not naked. He also said that the man was lying in a sports shirt with white rings.
A few meters later, the body was found by other persons dressed in a red sport shirt and blue cotton boots.
All three were lying on their way to the ground.
According to local data, all three persons were likely killed elsewhere because no attacks were found.
There were references to one group of organised crime another and also a number of steps on the board of the chat, and both on the stand and on the door.
At Cadreyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The National Defence Secrets represented 11 persons including young people who were members of a criminal group, particularly in the area of Cadreyt and who were associated with rape, murder, prosecution and illegal rape.
According to the information published during the first attempt on 11 November, 8 persons were detained in the Los Alveros colony and one detained person was released.
Three property and mobile phones were secured. They confirmed that they were members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On 12 November, at 6 p.m., the military staff was on the scene in Rancho Viejo in Cadereyt when he saw the car without the SPZ and two persons in it.
After the car was stopped, they carried out a search and discovered one gun, the hostages and 18 fighters.
On 13 November, on the basis of these statements, one of La Frauda's complexes was held around 14 o'clock. When the soldiers saw him, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal funerals in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed in the middle
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which will face the crisis that is facing this country over the loss of economic disaster.
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which will face the crisis that is facing this country over the loss of economic disaster and which has put the whole eurozone at risk.
The Presidential Chamber issued a message announcing that Monti, named Sunday, will meet with President Giorg Napolitano in the middle to confirm that he can create the government.
It is expected that the government will present a complex majority of technology, although it is not yet clear when the new government is in power.
Monti announced that he would present the results of his talks to the President, which led to political parties trying to create the government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to create the government, but his tone of comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The arm is now well-defined," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, so in a much shorter time than usual. During the meantime, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis because of which the debt has been paid at an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim has to accept a strong package of controversial measures required by European leaders, which will only be possible to restore the renewed credibility of Italy.
In Montiho there is a great pressure to speed up. Due to market instability, the levels of the Italian long-term BTP were exceeded by 7 per cent ceilings, at the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for savings.
Emma Marcagaglia, the president of the Italian Confindustria Workers' Organization, told reporters after a meeting with Montim, "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this desperate situation.
Monti hopes for success, thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which was given by the crisis on Saturday to withdraw.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts have been translated into good results," said journalists Angelina Alfano, secretary of the media.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because by this time the entire number of its members had turned against the government with the technological majority of Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament so that it can pursue non-popular slow reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in that effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial market.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added pressure to ensure that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started on Monday meeting with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
It's about to end tomorrow night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday as President Napolitan, who was able to respond to the crisis very quickly.
After a short break from the end of last week, when Berlusconi was apparently decommissioned, Italian debt levels returned to the critical border and reacted to such uncertainty as to whether the new president was successful.
To save Italy whose public debt is moving up to EUR 1.8 billion would be above the possibilities of current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite the general forecast that the politicians are only giving him time to carry out reforms and then declare provisional elections.
Monti pointed out that he would like to start politics in his office, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts in order to bring Italy out of the chaos in which the country has suffered from financial pressure.
Political resources have indicated that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties are complicated by attempts to enter into government and political personality.
Spanish participants in international events more often than Costa Rica
Of 22 Spanish photographers, 10 cross the border of 50 international events.
On the coast of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 registered players arrived at the number of 50 matches.
Large contrast on the coast of Costa Rica, compared with 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly meeting at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe's champions, the number one month's FIFA rating, have a wide range of cross-border classes A, Costa Rica has only Michael Umana's defense, which as the only one played 50 international events.
This number reached last Friday at the game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Utuna of the stars and in the powerful British first leagues hold an intensive activity over the year on ill champions and domestic prizes and high-level matches in European prizes such as the Champions League.
In the past, we must also add experiences from the national Spanish team in complex programming events at European and global workshops.
Costa Rican players, however, have very limited possibilities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign bids from the Spanish representative has on his account the banker Íker Casillas, who delivered to former banker Andoni Zubizarreta on 126 international bids last Saturday before England (the 0-1 prize in London).
Casallas will also come against Costa Rica today and will receive for Spain a new record - 127 international interviews.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 pieces on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced UEFA together with other Spanish players who have hundreds of sports. Among them is already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the average attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The sister also approached Carles Puyol with 97 tapes.
Following Habi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inniesta with 62; Csc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the coast of Costa Rica and near Michael Umana are moving left wing Junior Díaz with 48 gears and Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Only 5 crossed the limit of 30 steps: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of tapes.
With less than 30 savings in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 seats are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't go beyond 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
The best shot in Spain is David Villa with 50 feet and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the coast of Costa Rica has the most principles of Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"Cesta on Costa Rica is a dream that happens to be true"
In an exclusive conversation for Viva, founder Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is prepared next Sunday to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that they have the opportunity to play on Costa Rica represents a full dream.
So said the founder and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the existence and will be on Sunday 20th in Central America.
This day comes from 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the Angelic Group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an indication of the conversation you will find on La Nación’s website.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you know what your fans are doing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream, which happens to be reality.
In South and Central America, we've been a bit of a bit of a second and experienced experience.
It's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to spend a few days here.
So we're so glad we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because there's a group of texts loving here, fans live these days very intensively.
What do you say to your most mean lawyers?
Thank you for staying with us so long.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica.
Some people are already talking about the biggest show of the year.
Does it cause more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the last 21 years have been in the horizon for a few weeks.
We've performed some great shows in São Paulo and we hope we've got ourselves into a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really excited about this concert.
We love this country, we love serfing, we like jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Kostrik and her hair suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, these are the best surfing places we've ever known about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tournaments, you've prepared a huge show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we've never played here, we don't have any limitations we can't do.
We'll try to imagine the best show with the varied recordings. We'll try to play some songs from each album and present our fans with a good and varied repertoire.
You're never going to pack a repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 recordings and everyone likes other recordings, so it's hard to choose which songs we'll play every night.
If we have two three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we're gonna focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we loved them so much and we may have forgotten that.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This is where you celebrate 20 years of art roads.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, sure.
First of all, I think that none of us have been able to imagine that we will be in one big rock band and that we will stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we were given, and we realize that we can still play together.
We like it and we like to make music.
We're lucky we can look at the places we've always been looking for.
We couldn't have liked better.
What did it mean for you to be an important part of the origin of the granules?
It has always been a privilege for us to be part of this group where the great ones themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's amazing when the urge comes from a group of friends, it's very often not going to happen.
The time from time to time comes in the city of a group, but it's much less common for five to ten groups to get out of one city.
We're proud of this and we're honored to be part of the Seattle team.
Sometimes we're playing with someone else.
Last year we were at a party with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We're glad that they're all our friends and we're honored that we can be part of this excitement that happened in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like you to stay together and have the same members over the years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is now much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think we're all happy first that we're still in this world and we're playing our part in the fact that we're always interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and this has enabled us to open up the musical pathways that allow each of us sufficient freedom to experiment on our own.
We trust each other, we respect the music of another, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the equation?
As we grew up, it was gradually becoming easier to find balance.
We're trying not to drive too much on the tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of taxes and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come because of music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it. You must not forget that you are famous, rock stars.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we've been writing great songs, and it was something big at first.
As a hat we existed for three years and never released any album until after Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it lasted so long. Most importantly, even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the chapel with us. When I hear a song or see pictures, I remember Andy how incredible he was how I laughed. It was always the joy of working with him, laughing, playing about music or football and many more.
It was an incredible person, and we miss him so much.
National Captain Las Robertas will be entrusted with starting a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their jobs, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as your superior?
Yes, the producer sent us videos with a few suggestions and this group liked us the most. That's why we know what Las Robertas offers alive and must be very fun.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbutter's words alive?
That's a question about Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings and I think he's adding the first thing he's going to attack.
Who's affecting you like a bassist?
A lot of people.
As I was first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so much I could talk about basics I like all night long.
How did Pearl Jam get to hold the grunge, though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt a lot easier apart from the words of the grunge.
When it's called Grung, I'm going to introduce myself to the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that happened at the same time. And if this song is still available today, it's something great because it's the music that stands for listening to it and the bands like Mudhoney today are playing better music than ever before.
At first your music had a calm character and now it's more positive.
What's the point of this change?
That's interesting because I have a feeling that in the new album there are some recordings that are easier to read, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very clever, although they can be expressed as positive.
At two times when Ed was playing me, I cried, and it was really dark.
I think if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose a family member or a friend, these things will begin to affect your art and music and these two songs for me exactly represent that.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still do decent music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been hospitalized again because of medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in the public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the area of the lower limbs, informing his healer.
72-year-old Fujimori, who has been sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several disabilities, including cancer of the tongue, which has been four times healed and now has doctors under control.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguyunaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television stations that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Non-Plastic Diseases for three days, where they should find out why he is suffering and why he is losing his strength in the bottom ends.
Aguyunga said that, according to his opinion, Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself did not expect mercy because he felt innocent.
He was four times infected with cancer of the tongue, 18 kilograms per kilogram, and other complications such as severe erosive gastritis, urinary cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bone problems were added to these problems, including the doctor.
Fujimori has been punished since September 2007 by the National Police Service.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who had killed the killer squadrons of the army illegally during the first years of his reign.
Music on Mexico's visit to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, which has been carried out by several ministers and businessmen, starts in Mexico's Tuesday visit. Its aim is to achieve expansion of trade between the two nations and to address the political issues of the region.
Mujica is meeting in the middle with its Mexican rival, Felipe Calderón. It is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting with political representatives, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of both Presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between both countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to take Calderón to support Uruguay in its dispute with France, which came when French President Nicolas Sarkozy organized South America on a list of G20 tax havens in the French city of Cannes.
In its vision of Sarkozy, it threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of the tax havens will be excluded from the international community.
Mexico is the President of G20 from November. G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world. With the said Latin American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange information to prevent double taxation has been concluded.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has sought to concreteize the tax exchange agreement with a view to obtaining from the "Black Paper" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which are countries that have not met all the international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From Mexico and Uruguay's commercial perspective, since 2004, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been concluded, thanks to which trade between the two countries has been strengthened.
Vouchate installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from some of Bowser's crimes, yet he has never appeared in 3D: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for a love girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all world trades has been created since the beginning in order to use all the features that offer a portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a position that has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said an employee of the print specialized in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo created especially for this wearer", because until now successful photos such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zerda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
Speaker Nintendo pointed out that besides that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Available" video game that allows you to enjoy fast and floating parties.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less handy users.
Once you win this level, you can get into "second car" at the level games that are more affordable this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or such a one that has only an impact on the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D to make it possible to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not to fall into optical clubs".
This new 3-D Super Maria event also proposes a return to a transfer console that has not been reached since 2005.
In this video, Nintendo plays in the notes of those who watch and repeat the sword successfully from the previous parts. It begins with the fact that your husband's installer will have to go through dangerous alternative platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the environment, in rivals and also among enemies, Luigi is also "dead".
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
On Tuesday, President Álvaro Colom announced that he had taken steps to issue former President Alfonso Portilla, who is going to respond to an appeal for $70 million in the United States.
This is the end of the process which was aimed at responding to Guatemala's request for a northern country that requires Portilla to be issued so that she can be tried.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he recalled that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He ensured that during his mandate, he "did not interfere" with the judicial decisions and allowed all the publications that he had received on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious health injury and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The step of the column is a step of execution after all the judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to bring proceedings against the former President who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of a 120 million in the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency, but the public ministry refused and returned to the game.
Trinij's help 6000 young people at risk
The organization has come to help children without education to avoid being victimized at the end of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the organization's existence of social support is very important: 6,000 young people who have threatened social exclusion have received help. The organization has helped them to overcome the difficult situation for 25 years.
To that end, it is necessary to count the long percentage of jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday’s production also served to represent a balance sheet within the framework of the celebration act, which was played in the former manufacturing premises of Fabra and Coats and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove's organization was established in the fourth Trinitate Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, unemployment, drug dependence or in situations where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives from organisations and institutions working with associations over the past 25 years participated in the meeting in Sant Andrew yesterday.
The wide-ranging political representation, in the time of the elections, has shown a unique character of work performed by Trinij.
Together with President Generalitat, Arture Mass and his predecessor Jordi Pujolem, former socialist educator Ernest Maragall participated in the celebration of the event, and the former mayor of old age and contemporary ecological-socialist workman Richard Goma.
In the great Chamber of Fabra and Coats, there was also a contemporary councillor for Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Claires, and the director general of social work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mass said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that today's time is also a whole series of obstacles, but he added that the work which association has brought today "is a good foundation".
The President cited Trini as an example of how it is possible to fight unwarranted circumstances and how to give attention to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does for nothing new," he said.
There was an escape from the house where giant festivals were held
Firefighters owned 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 employees left their house yesterday morning without complaining about their opposition.
All of them bear witness that the night's march, which the neighbors of number 51 in the Balmes Street, is finally over.
Twelve people left the building that they were illegally living in and where they organized giant festivals that were built by neighbors. They left the building out of the court regulation without having to arrest the police.
After the operation ended, a lock on the door was changed to prevent the situation from being reversed.
"From now on, the entry will be viewed," the manager said.
The contractors who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest of the building - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, apart from reducing walls and leaving behind all sorts of wastes, especially after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted for up to two days and rented other tenants.
According to the building, the discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europe Press that by the time the building was occupied, the market had closed by 80%.
The discotheque owner points out that the owners of the buildings made some competition for it because they sold wines for 3 euros, where the discotheque stood for 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to complaints from neighbors because of noise. However, problems did not affect visitors of discotheques, but residents of the house were banned, and in particular those who participated here at organized festivals, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks grew according to the divorced inhabitants of the environment.
The discotheque’s owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and he would let her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that over the last few weeks, she has had more difficulties than neighbors in the situation.
The president of the PP's civil group at the workshop, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week "the building was immediately moved out and ended with the problems of civil relations which the neighbors are suffering and the destruction of the area".
The president explained that there was only one income ban earlier this year, but in recent months the occupying Power had reached all the roofs of buildings and almost all the apartments and even in one of them there had been stolen.
In this direction, he added that "it must be concluded with uncertainty and be consistent if it is to address the effects of civil liability that has come into the building".
Yesterday, the city police also destroyed the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 hours 30 minutes, the police got to the building 35 on the Mont-ral street after they called her neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were arrested right away.
Park or worse?
Architects met at the opportunity to issue proceedings that carried out more than a range of fees
The 16-year-old city election will reopen the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, in the time of the largest resolution, Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government issued several pamphlets in support of the Collserola park.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metro park in Barcelona.
More than that, he was supplemented by a number comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the loss of CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as Barcelona's top border. The Catalan metropolis is still one of the small that are not oriented towards the north axis - they are, but up (high) - down (sea).
Qualifications of Collseroly as a natural park are going this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildebeests instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September when the workshop announced a competition mega created by 16 competitions at the same number of entry branches to Collseroly.
Of course, the defense is more of a park's mind.
Either this or someone's trying to put the defense on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of the clean organization, and based on the reflection of the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already the same theme as when two members of this old box are hand-held when they meet in the exhibition.
And this is exactly what he called one of the rare agreements between the three Barcelona architects and the pre-eminent university professors.
Miguel Rollan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its place.
According to Roldán, after the question of the fire site began, "it is necessary to discuss "the mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerda's demonstration of green apples was not reached until the end.
"We have to come out of principle that the most spectacular Barcelona park is the beach.
Except for its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," he declared an architect for which the name "branch to Collserola" in itself means "lexicological past": we cannot imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as limiting the area where it is possible to proceed".
The module, like Rollan and Bayon with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that looks like "some danger".
It is dangerous because of "uncertainty which represents a project of public place" after an 80-year-old experience in the Forum "his favorite song".
The first concern is to limit the borders where they should be placed.
"Something to measure means to take another step already," it's basically a step forward.
"It is necessary to remember new urban and planning tools because these current (with reference to the General Metropolis Plan (GPM)) can cause real confusion."
If we focus more on the issue, Modul is thought to be able to "consider Collserola as a park", but the Barcelona section is not any, for reasons of pure topographical.
The module also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, who "does not end up on the spot", even though he welcomes the fact that the workshop offers his gramme that it will interfere with the project from "the first time".
And he also understands that the proximity of mountains and cities is a kind of waste that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "he has doubts" that it should be this technical profile that leads to multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", he adds), which should create: "Architecturals should be only tools".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because, in the context of the selection process, there is a lack of a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 selection procedures announced that all the people of the mountains - the sea, but there is no remote study that would look at and understand it as a whole".
This is why at least he joined all 16 election proceedings.
Otherwise the same project of one port can be found on the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring port.
According to him, the Council should ensure that the bridge located directly above Ronda de Dalt should be secured throughout the entire area of equipment which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed through Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal strength of Cadino Red granted the kindness of the aged brother of Monterrey in a process where he was sentenced to death.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after his legal strength Casino Red handed down his mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the case of an invention in which he was accused of being an elderly brother of Monterrey.
After an attack on Casino Royale's owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil García published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask for payment of economic quotas so that the workshop in Monterrey would allow illegal operations in the home of the village.
After a public complaint, the State prosecutor initiated the criminal arrest of the Panistic Age brother. September 2nd was held and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours before the public ministry agent, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital city.
This place remained 49 days after the second regulation was introduced and the public ministry agent returned the possibility of co-operation or organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyt criminal court for suspecting that the owners of Casino Red had been fired by one and a half million dogs. However, he remained in prison for only a few hours with a moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The chairpersons allowed him to stay in the city hall in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who announced that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to show Jonah’s guilt. Among the evidence is the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the casino representatives of the transaction for an oath that the operation would be possible.
This morning, the legal strength of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brothers of the elderly region. On this basis, it will be possible to return soon.
During the legal proceedings, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the partners had decided to do so.
According to the 197/2011 official record, the legal mercy of Jonas Larrazabal is granted. In the process he has been led against, there will be no difficulty. It is also not possible to apply for damage or punishment.
After the trial with the legal strength of around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The court's secret officer, Jorge Yañez, presented himself to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonah that he had been granted official mercy and that his case had been thrown into the archives.
He was also informed that the judge had issued an immediate regulation on his release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, presented details of the plane accident that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The communication and transport secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of an accident investigation by Francisco Blake Mora and the other seven persons indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground by force without the pilot having a chance to try for forced accession.
At the press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, a communication and transport secretary, pointed out that prior to the start of the flight, the pilot found that climate conditions allow for summer.
"Parts that appear indicate that the unit has come into contact with the ground several times, the wings have penetrated into the trees 25 metres from where the unit has lost the body."
He also informed that the unit had been designated for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the carriage of personnel.
Furthermore, it stated that on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of injury, no parts were found on the ground.
"It was found in the search that parts of the aircraft are not located elsewhere, so the aircraft landed on a pole as a celebrity.
"The locker was appointed for 19 persons, meeting all requirements for the transport of persons.
The ground shows everything from seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary has made sure that at present it is the most important to obtain the fastest results. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Air Force Director and Assistant Services, announced that at the moment the President-General's steering wheel was moving at the speed of flight and the accident occurred in the soft-down area.
"This information supports the hypothesis that in the event of an accident there was an ordinary flight operation," he said.
At the SCT representative conference, Pérez Jácome mentioned six main points of study:
Visual year:
In accordance with flight rules, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the appropriate conditions at the start, according to this plane, the direction to the border between DF and the State of Mexico has been dark in the low altitudes.
Allowed paths:
It is likely that because of the dark crowd, they were looking for a lower area and a higher visibility up to the Cuernavac valley.
The location of the scene.
It is likely that there has been no loss of control or infringement of the flight trajectory before the accident.
Explanation of aircraft residues in the restricted territory:
The information we have currently available enables us to assume that we have reached the same trajectory and from side to side.
The distance between the rest of the aircraft indicates that at the time of the crash, the helicopter was a celebrity.
There was no fire or explosion.
Unfortunately, no evidence was found to support the explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that it may have been able to reach several contacts with the firm.
During field work, the remaining aircraft were found at altitudes of up to 9200 degrees above sea level, the ground is being measured and the surface is from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sights that were likely to fall apart from the path mentioned.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could be contacted in several places.
After careful surveillance in the environment, no remains were found in the area that is more extensive than the land of extinction, which reinforces the view that there was an accident when the vertebrate was still a celestial one.
The Mexican Institute for Health Insurance initiated a gene research that causes stress
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research with a view to discovering the genes responsible for obese children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of IPN experts
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting a research aimed at detecting the cause of obesity in children and young people. The research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will enable you to obtain the results related to obesity.
In a report by the leading Research Medical Unit in the Biochemistry of the Specialised Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, survivors and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of experts and postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Research and Advanced Studies Centre (Cinvestäst) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research can also be conducted by a wide audience, with or without rights. People can attend IMSS sports centres in Valle de Mexico, where they will be tested for 8 hours at each meeting by young people.
He pointed out that he started research at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October, this activity is also being carried out at the Sports Centre Nezahualcóyolt (External State of Mexico).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Centre of Independent (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Centre Morelos (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the objective of this research is to identify the complexity and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to expose to the risk factors of Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to gather information from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years of age, in agreement with and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific life questions.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family minimum parental disabilities with a view to avoiding risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal failure.
He pointed out that each Saturday all participants are carrying out anthropometric measurements (weight, height, range of passion), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genes are identified (tested to identify genes that are part of the cause of child obesity).
Cruz López indicated that this study reflects the concern of doctors over alarming increase in child’s weight.
'The health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and a 47% increase in girls.
He pointed out that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the view that the population of the country differs from the rest of the population of its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic training, 30% European and 5% African. This reality is reflected in genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and obesity.
He explained that the genetics of obesity are generally explained as a failure to fuel the excess energy that we consume (calorie) and which is absorbed in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct use of participants is based on a comprehensive assessment of the status of children, which will determine whether some of them are known to be overweight or obese.
He pointed out that even the presence of acantosis in the breast indicates that the individual is likely to suffer from metabolic problems and precodiciary conditions.
The information is still reliable, doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in the lifestyle they have to make in order to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: a life-threatening life-threatening lack of day-to-day physical activity, a full-day TV session and use of transport facilities instead of a short walk.
The emphasis also results in great caloric intake, which is increased consumption of low drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of fats and proteins and genetic stress, which is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt with UNAM there will be no requests
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and creates such a mixture of better function, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If it is properly cared for, almost 200 thousand claims should not be corrected after each period of rain in the Valle de México metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical College (FQ), who added that if construction and maintenance of asphalt coatings were adequate, significant requirements would be reduced or even removed.
In its presentation The technological reason for the applications made during the International Year of Chemicals announced that the laboratory under its control develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture of similar characteristics such as as as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both in low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera is believed to be able to use this type of modified asphalt in places with extremely hot climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve function and reduce the creation of demands.
He explained that asphalt, the most difficult part of the robin, is the collection of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight called asphaltenes, and other low molecular weights called maltens.
The viscosity of asphalt begins in that it is treated as liquid at about 180 degrees, at 120 degrees with high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost in a stable state, while at low temperatures it has an asphalt tendency to slow down, added.
This means that asphalt's integrity in the streets is not unique, but changes are made during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, by an expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Chemical Faculty observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered by a flexible bed, which creates six types of materials, of which three are finally mixed with asphalt.
Among the top species is the asphalt layer, made of small stones in the asphalt and then pressed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes a contribution is to burn with asphalt.
When driving or when making pressure, it is as good as possible that they are able to stand in good position.
If it were about modified asphalt, it would be even better, it would be thought to be a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt cartridge, the last species is replaced by a layer called a fine stone and therefore also a sand in the asphalt.
In view of the fact that this type will come into contact with the brakes of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than an asphalt cartridge and must ensure train training.
In view of the fact that as part of the coating it will be very heavy, there must be enough load and attention must be paid to the material from which it is made.
The climate, particularly humidity and temperature changes, is also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular water has a major impact on the function of asphalt.
As soon as the ground is soft, the water spreads inside and it is difficult to get out, it causes all kinds of damage and thus causes complaints.
He explained that during the production of requests, the film was the first to finish the plague and then it came to damage the asphalt deposits. However, it does not occur at once, but it is a voluntary process that should be stopped at the first signs of maintenance.
As a member of the National Sciences System, he also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the creation of demand, and that the weight of each individual type of charge must be equal to the load of the vehicle and must be assured that this burden will not exceed.
Rafael Herrera warned that when it comes to asphalt, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research to begin. For example, asphalt emulsions that are already available in other countries are available on the market and allow us to easily fix requests without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing a candidate from Valle to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's not getting Miss Columbia's crown.
That's how Valle gets the 14th title of the first vice-mission.
Valle del Cauca is missing again on Miss Columbia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to calm down because she felt on the ground of victory, got a silver ring and a helmet on which the new first vice-mission of Colombia had become.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, where she won and won Miss Atlantic, mentioned by the department, won the 14th prize. Melina thus joined the representatives of the women from Valle del Cauca, who had won the winning race, but were eventually declared the first prize. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Mary Alzate (1981), Olga María Arenas (1983), Leila Evers (1989), Mónía Consuela Gevers (1989), María Garpéro (1990), Diana Gialle (Garno) Gialle (1990), Diana Gialle (Girle).
The question that many people are looking forward to.
As a result, the defeat of the great favour shown in all previous cars is to become a new Miss Columbia and not free of charge to the Royal Police and the Most Hessier forms by Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Italiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who later took the title Miss Columbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to call it the First Vice-mission is the fact that she did not give her answer to the question: "What book did you like most and why?" by Martin Murillo Gómez from the literary edition of Leamos.
The applicant replied to the question:
"Read a lot. I believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in childhood was "Little Prince", a very deep book.
It's a book that is part of the worldwide literature we should all know about. And today I have a book from Irene Niemirovski, Russian author. It's a wonderful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, she did not like this answer because of the term "culturalization" and the second reason why the candidate did not explain why the individual books mentioned were noted.
After the holiday ceremony Melina announced that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is going to happen will happen.
And you people, read it if you can.
One of the other hypotheticals is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
The theologian noted that since the beginning the candidate was the most popular, the most respected and the one who had all the previous prices (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best art suit and the Queen's mother), has raised the dependence on other figures, which then burned the queen on the scene.
This was familiar during the first presentation of the swimming pool on Hilton beach and during two views before final coronation.
Even though she was on both sides, it was known that she lacked the strength and courage of the representatives from Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the Canal RCN's Canal Program, believes that Melinda has won the title of the first vice-mission confirms the fact that the candidate who receives the most titles during the competition does not finally go with the royal crown".
In addition to Valle's last few days, there was a more negative attitude toward the media and it didn't pay for it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the court of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
On the other hand, two days before the election of the International Court of Justice, Lucy Dughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the contest Miss Columbia beauty itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important for candidates to be involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also estimated that candidate Valle has lost points because of her background and fibrosis that were on the back. But this is quite contrary to the jury's verdict that she chose the "natural beauty" mission for the most healthy body, right life and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, admits that Melina didn't have the best body here, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the back, which, I believe, were not too familiar, took her points until the last day."
In the meantime, the newspaper Guido Hoyos of Cromos is believed to have made a mistake when she took several surgical steps.
"Surgeons are okay, but they didn't tell them in Valle.
The body was never her strong page and here it was chosen."
Because of this evaluation, which was first made by the National Beauty Collection, after the survey in the lungs, came to a severe warning that it was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the peace that Raymondo Meliné agreed not to finally give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has begun her reign today, not as queen, but as queen, from a position that allows her to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded as one of the queens who, despite the sustained success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest rank.
This was the work of the inhabitants of Cali who identified the dead of Alfonso Cana.
Cali's fingerprint expert came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfons Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November of the London year, the expert on CTI fingerprints in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of Farc: "Alfonse Cana", which is by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working on the CTI department, this week was a series of men from Port Tejada who has worked in the judicial field for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he had to spend more than five days walking through the jungle in order to get to a place where dead people needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the main city of Valle and after graduating from the course he had completed, he began specializing in fingerprints. This knowledge is based on a study of skin training, which means hand-and-hand surgery.
The week after the operation was carried out against Alfonso Cana, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a wheelchair from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he was suspected that one of them was a man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take a card from the fingerprints of Guillerma Leon Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where she was found dead, he didn't recognize her because of the physical appearance, and he seemed quite different from the media.
He didn't have you, dressed like a village in a given area, with no glasses, much more tighter.
But prints don't.
Along with a gallon lamp, an incoherent and a transplanter and light Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the dead with the records of the card.
It wasn't about her, it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was convinced that the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirmed whether he really was the greatest leader of Farc.
Searching for a path
For the Dacttiloscope of Sijín de Cali, it is the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos of Eliazar González held at a press conference of operational services against "Canovi".
Most people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscope is accurate knowledge, without the possibility of errors that can play a key role in the decision of criminal acts.
In addition to identifying the dead, these people assist in investigating criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When caught, many dealers present false evidence or have no papers at all.
We'll get them fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the event of injury, he had to remove the roof of the house from his house because the thief was working on this site to remove a treasure full of spices and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to pick up prints, but in this case we were able to obtain prints of all hands and identify the security officer who participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints may also confirm or reverse suspicion in the case of murder.
Recently they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the pressure on the shoulder actually confirmed it.
Although there is no percentage to confirm that he was a real murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that from the articles the prints are "contained by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, the transplanter or sand shall be used for their selection.
Then prints are sent to Asif, which is the deligent database, or to the Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians at present whose data are not stored anywhere," a CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as indicated in the CSI TV program.
Just as everything that falls apart is not gold, not everything that you touch, remains feet.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Figure" protesting in New York
Hundreds of protesters were pushed into Zuccotti's place where they wanted to stay.
Most of them were waiting for an order to move out of space and moved to a nearby park.
The members' arrests of the Wall Street were filed in New York's next day when they tried to get back to Manhattan, where they were released this morning, and then they tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of protesters were pushed to Zuccotti's village, where they wanted to get through the court order that allows the "distorted" to return to the place. The other part of the mob responded to the move by taking the park to the north of the city where it came to another detention.
"If the court doesn't allow us to go back to town, we'll sit somewhere else and we'll continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, and it's like by means of a gathering, such peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers "Let's get out of Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the "distorted" response to the move of the camp, which was ordered by Mr. Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent movement of places and allowed protesters to stay here.
In addition to the "distortion" they took another park located at the crossings of the Central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Netherlands tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the fair in Trinity Church.
At least an hour they were allowed to take their place, but then the police came and held some protesters.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people are involved in the scene, and the delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and to try to contact the police.
Between the town of Zuccotti, which is a private property, it remains closed. It is expected that the court deal should come to it right in the morning and during which it should analyse the law of early evacuation.
Some of the displaced protesters even broke down and distributed copies of the court order and even handed it to the officials who were watching the site, which called "some small shots", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police protesters were.
The court orders the authorities to send members of "Occupa Wall Street" or to use "laws published after the event has begun or to prohibit protesters from accessing the park with the trade or other places they previously used".
The Old Bloomberg pointed out for the press that, in view of this court order, the city has stopped opening the public space again and has warned the demonstrators that local laws do not allow them to return to the state and the spaces.
The highest representative of the city personally protected the early eviction of Zuccotti, operations where 200 persons were detained and admitted because demonstrators "have violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the city to be evacuated because it became "a place where people didn't go to protest, but to break laws and in some cases to approach others", because "some businesses got dangerous letters" and "neighbourers were afraid of the quality of their lives".
"The early departure was clear and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests for the benefit of an American worker," added the speaker's urge, which accused the old man that "he does not consider freedom of expression".
The representatives of the "Occupa Wall Street" campaign also indicated that they are planning to organize "big action" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organisations to remember two months after which they are protesting.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Mrs. Marie to the special evening TV show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was a helper to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a swim in "Baywatch", a "Playboy", a wife of the year-old singer Tommy Lee and now a heretic and model will be made by Mrs. Maria in a special evening television series.
The private TV station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with a number of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will kiss Mrs. Mary.
CTV today showed interest in a television program in which Anderson is also known from the Internet pornography home photo, appeared with his ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as Miss Maria, who was presenting Jesus in a similar fashion.
As Josef appears on the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comedy of Indian origin who recently acted as a modator on the tour "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Except for Anderson and Peters, the special evening broadcast of CTV reveals a Canadian song Bublé, which was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentinian model Luisano Lopilato, which is close to the controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York "Lick".
Japan will return to life after the devastating earthquake
HDP grows by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of leave that began in March
Since March of the year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now suffering from the devastating earthquake that has increased in the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates by Tokyo governments have estimated the material losses of $300 million, a wound that is well maintained despite the difficult world situation.
After three quarters of the payments, the value of GDP between July and July reached such a position that it was possible to round the site with definitive validity: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year begins in March 2012 - also predict the maximum growth rate compared with the winter to early 2010.
It is possible to explain in part the purchase of machinery which are necessary for the restoration of the area of destroyed landslides and subsequent tsunamis.
The subcontractors increased their investment by 1.1%, costing a fine of 0.9% of the ice to the coast. This is the first fall after six months of steady growth.
However, the real provocation of the Japanese economy comes from an impulse that urges us to use the crisis to get out of it or to get back to infrastructure.
Japan woke up, particularly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This change has increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
New Stigma
So it turned into an internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saved values" for investors who escape the long-term crisis from the eurozone and the US disturbing projections. This is a privilege which is at the same time a major concern for exporting companies.
The stronger the exchange, the more expensive the products are, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony counted their weak results in July until the harvest was just a yen.
While the markets continue to slow down the EU's coastal countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is transparent.
"We need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yenu," stated State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And really, perspectives aren't quite exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) explained that most Member States had shown clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator predicting world economic instability has shown that the economy of major powers is declining.
It dropped by four decades to 100.4 points around 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even reached the average at level 100. It has reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens Again Spreads Uncertainty
Papadimos says opposition measures will be approved, but conservatives do not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky border guarantees and uncertainty once again, Greece is becoming increasingly vulnerable to a labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the major debt crisis in Europe.
The view that the "hoda" of the new transitional Greek government is given more to Brussels' requirements than to the real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While a new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period that he has received at his appointment will probably be short for their application, the Conservative Party's President of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new opposition measure would not, in any case, support and restore its requirement to issue new elections on the proposed date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will raise tomorrow's vote on the government's confidence.
The package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax collectors will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras report does not explain any doubt as to his existence: "We have committed to the aid of the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went to the EU and the IMF a little further, and these organisations have to block 8 billion which Athens urgently needs, but he has also declared that he does not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of the contested measures.
The European Commission has already been resolved by the impact that had caused Papandre's players with the referendum yesterday stressed that its requirements are inexhaustible: it does not block any aid if the new government and the representatives of the main parties do not sign "a written commitment without duality and what may happen first".
Speaking for economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very fast" to Athens and will meet with the new government about "what needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek legend still has a moment to fall from.
King Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Kingdom raises Spain’s position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a significant global level in terms of microfinance".
King Sofia reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet, with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose foundation is "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
The Queen opened yesterday the 5th World Summit of Microbes in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" about this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals to achieve a reduction in half of the people living with less than one dollar a day, with a share of poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all the remote planets and take this task responsible", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure better capacity-building and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are primarily targeted by these loans.
"We've already met a lot" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro-loans summary should be not only a discussion forum but also a platform that supports "the basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million families are over the poverty that they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loan expands into Spain and other states of the world after "which was published on this road by Professor Muhammad Yunus", the king introduced and added that one "of the act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as "the amazing idealism that emerged on the way to fight poverty." He met with his work 15 years ago when he went to Bangladesh to meet him directly at his place with his political loan.
The first global summit in Washington and another meeting, such as in the Solomon Islands in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I was able to see continuous development, explained the queen who, thanks to her support for this project yesterday, served as "the head of the family", which gave it "the support of the poor in Valladolid".
Queen Sofie concluded her presentation by calling on the participants to engage in the discussion and seek solutions and thus enable them to continue to fight poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is ethical imperative", which must be directed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the balobacco, because this cooperation is "permanent duty".
Jiménez is believed to represent "a serious and positive policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever before, the governments of the developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of corruption.
For Spain, microfinance is one of the main development cooperation lines.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of the concept based on our trust in the people who all others are closing the door. Mr. Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city which "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity which is responsible".
The CDU proposes the will of the European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious problems for the Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angel Merkel passed on Monday, 14 November in Lipsk on the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU).
The issue of Europe's future was not originally on the programme, but it was still under way, especially in order to calm the members of the government's policy against the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow against the Italians.
The proposal concerning the European Commission's leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegations were voting against.
A few minutes of sheep come to the end of Angely Merkel's performance and after a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be included in the slogan: the answer to the crisis "Not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "9 million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time of change has come."
This could be expressed by the amendments to the Lisbon Treaty which would enable the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of a proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree on this revolutionary step quickly: against the United Kingdom and the leading CDU representatives think that we will take the same position as Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is gone.
Similarly, the delegates refused to make a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's representation, depending on its economy's weight, which is evidently due to Germany's weight increase.
A leading age to calm the climate inside its side, the Chancellor made several references to Konráda Adenauer and Helmuta Kohl. But she did not try to get a convention about "small" European states or countries that are in trouble, willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
Perhaps the proposal concerning Europe is one of the highlights of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel of France did not feel.
We just don't know.
She reminded me that just two thousand years ago she had a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most repugnant defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is the underlying problem of unemployment?
Support shall be provided by the UMP party and by the Government of Offensives against Labour Incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will give evidence on the topic of combating social disadvantages and redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As evidence of this offensive, which is driven by the desire to take the stand in the context of increased strength, but is not less clear from the view of the right presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on labour incapacity.
First of all, because of the budgetary arrangements, the government intends to introduce private sector employees on the fourth day of unemployment before they start to receive unemployment support.
It is clear that without the company's consent, an employee who is ill would lose four days of work, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measures risking a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the list of Les Echos, could amount to EUR 280 million.
The measures would also be implemented by another means of the symbolic approach: to give public employees one day the unskilled employment capacity (which has not yet been able to recover for three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of the debate, the majority of the legal parties will also leave the subject of subversives focusing on the abuses associated with labour inadequacies.
"The controls will be much wider and more: if you arrive, you will return," warned Xavier Bertrand at the interview at the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
Similarly, in other cases, the effects of notification appear to be somewhat inadequate due to the fact that there are errors in working capacity.
These were in fact the subject of ongoing monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are no more sick than others in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'Assurance disease (CNAM - State Health Insurance) more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008 the daily remuneration was EUR 11.3 billion in health expenditure 5%.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternal contributions and labour agencies and 54% were affected by labour shortages, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting group study, France had an average of 14.5 working days of 17.8 days in 2009.
The measure which hides certain differences in itself: another survey published in 2007 on the Monster.com employment opportunities sites showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed replied that they had no day to work incapacity.
Another study, carried out by non-insurance institutions this time, explained that in 2010 37.8% of job failures were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months, and 11% continued.
Compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no longer more vulnerable to labour shortages than others.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absences (for health reasons or none) increased between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of job failures, only a very small part of the job is reduced to black.
Well, if it's about underwater, these are just a small size.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at labour shortages for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million controls, 13.8% of 285,000 were conducted due to short-term "unrighted or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematic controlled disability over 45 days, 11% of "unauthorised or unauthorised" cases were calculated for 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
Thus, 169 000 "unlawful" cases of several million employees who were unemployed.
The number that represents much less than the number of working hours per black.
According to UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the Red Report on this issue, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the year's tax collection, i.e. more than a total of the daily wages, and thus more than the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos addressed Parliament and added that his Government will not be able to fulfil this task for a hundred days.
"In order to restore our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new saved budget," said the Head of Government when he found his first public demonstration at the beginning of the debate on confidence in Parliament.
The payment of decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone summit will be "the main task" of the new governments, as our country has added its share in the eurozone.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be from the end of the year "about 9%" of the gross domestic product after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new contested measures
Mr Samaras' Legal Leader expressed his support on Monday with a measure already approved to try to avoid the debt crisis, but he warned that his party was not committed to any additional dispute.
"We will not sign up for any new action," Samaras pointed out at a meeting with the MEPs on his side of the New Democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating fraud, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, European Commissioner for Economics and Trade, who warned that MMF and the EU would not block the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the proposed measure, answered Antonis Samaras that his word is sufficient and that he would not sign anything under any external pressure.
It is necessary to legislate euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are doomed to death.
In this context, the Commission urges governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cases of cancer.
The Canadian company lives by the thought of opening up death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make a decision in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive reports of the Royal Canadian Society, which was shared by six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the government amend criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option is deemed necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of this study, experts quoted a recent independent economicist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Perhaps Canada has moved to 10th place, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada has given rise to cultures where people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, informing us of experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And in the hope of dying in a home where most Canadians are dying, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This average is paid for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Québec this is the highest of 86% of the patients who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that they are opposed to the position of the federal government which has already said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicides does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also controlled all countries where these approaches are lawfully or not considered to be criminal cases, there is no evidence that this criminalisation has caused some abuse in application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides against persons who are not or do not agree.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of these arrests yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanazia is also being held in Canada where it is equally illegal."
"The assisted suicide is also being carried out in Canada where it is equally illegal," explains Jocelyn Down.
The Canadians are forced into euthanasia
Note that, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in the benefits of euthanasia because they believe that people are able to ease their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send a message that the lives of older or disabled persons have a lower price.
In the case of persons who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the questioned persons are judged not to be prosecuted.
In terms of maintenance or interruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
It is also proposed in the list of its recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that a derogation from a treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for professional doctors to be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without being subjected to criminal arrest.
In this context, the Commission urges governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cases of cancer.
Finally, in terms of palliative or final pressure already widely used in Canadian medical devices, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it is no longer necessary to reduce physical disease for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Remunerations of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their views on the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a medical law specialist, qualified the position of experts and signatories of the news as "extreme" except because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation when everyone who would be alive and who should be more than 18 years old could ask for help to escape suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also argues that it seems as if the authors of the reports have put people's autonomy above all other values that create a society's social heritage.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong intentions to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian company, is particularly concerned with data on the absence of suspicion in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the American state of Oregon.
Jordanian King calls on President Assada to withdraw
Damasjek is talking about "computer"
Syria is still more isolated
Toupenants of Bashar al-Assada showed yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assada, who, with Russia's support, is talking about "compute" against his country.
Two days after the withdrawal of the Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring country with Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordanian King Abdullah II was the first Arab state governor yesterday, who called President Bashar al-Assada to "presume power" in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military regime were killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to give up, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On his part, the Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu stated that his efforts to achieve the Turkish mediation granted to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those who don't live in peace with their people in the Middle East and can't calm them down, they're going to go," said the insult on the neighboring Syria against which Turkey applies as far as the stricter line continues.
The United States benefited from "enforcement of the consensus against Assad and unfair treatment of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey continue to apply as hard as ever" to Syria's repression, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian human rights observer, during this period 16 civilians and 19 members of the transitional forces were killed in the city of Dera in southern Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed "by fires and the middle of the heavy bombings in Jobar" in Homs.
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Mousalem concluded that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
He has recently responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to stop the Member States of Damascus, which he calls "hazardous step".
Syria doesn't escape," he added with assurance that "competence against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to stop Syria, the Member States are currently considering the League of Arab States "a mechanism for the protection of civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also warmly welcomed the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he says is "paranoid".
The new Special Meeting of the League refers to the morning of Rabat in order to draw up an opinion on the crisis resolution plan, which was decided on 2 December and which was proposed in particular to launch an army from the affected cities and release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov considered yesterday's decision by the League of Arab States to be "inconsequential", while China launched a plan to address the crisis, but in doing so it fully provided support for any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifice after Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that would contain " Victims" with a view to regaining confidence lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before he met with representatives of committees and employees today.
It should set up a relatively narrow cabinet consisting of non-participating technologies.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a messenger of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the discussions following a meeting with the appointed ministerial president.
President Gianfranco Fini expects that Mario Monti will ask Parliament to express its confidence in ensuring that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation ends with Mario Monti representing the small group of 12 ministers of President George Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "Democraticism pays precise terms" when it comes to the preparation of government and its programme, he stressed and added that "the markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as President was accepted from the start with a favourable acceptance of the market, but the concern again appeared after an unexpected finding of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team that includes in particular technology, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "political" policies.
He expressed the conviction that the new government will continue until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to President Gianfranca Fini's new government, the new government will receive Parliament's trust in Friday.
Mario Monti promised to meet with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of becoming a strong member of Europe once again.
European Commissioner Olli Rehna's spokesman stressed that "Our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing with the new government."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the controversial plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is equivalent to the 2013 budget, and calls for new firm measures.
The head of the business union Confindustria Emma Marcagaggli, meeting with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy 'because a country that does not show growth cannot meet the deficit parameters'.
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolised by the authors of "the challenge to importance" and "the "jino Italy", represents an urgent change" for Italy after 17 years "berlusconism".
A very unknown time will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to save early elections, as Italy has to place a national debt of EUR 200 billion by December 2012.
Soviet scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vyačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that is used for nuclear weapons, announced in the U.S. non-governmental organization on the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) shall examine the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAAE) and other documents unique to this UN agency.
Last week MAAE reported its "severe concerns" on the "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of ISIS, a wide range of MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (Nr. 1934) should have been working for three decades since the 17th year of the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural), where the production of synthetic diamonds was to be stopped by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave a medium term to establish a company producing "nano-dymantics" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company were to bring him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he had to work together on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report MAAE recalls "the clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" came from the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method but who, as one Member State informed the agency, worked during the essential part of its career in this technology under the country's military nuclear programme, where it comes from."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Delicts Rated 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and delicts targeted against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence was mildly slow or slightly slow at the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of cases of 13% of violence against Catholics, 4% of the crimes against Jews and 14% of the total increase in anti-religious criminal acts and delinquents.
The total number of "enemies of criminal acts" was very light in 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
"After the death of 2009, it is exciting to see these criminal acts and the delicacy again," added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leading actors of Paul Legendre's organization.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, adding that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on hate crimes."
"A hate crime" in American federal law is the legacy of a civil law struggle.
This rule of law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to combat violence related to race, color plagues, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The website providing microblogging services Twitter introduced a change in design Monday to allow its users to watch the activities of the following, which somehow compares its Facebook services.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow you to know better and directly the activities of other people who are watching you or people whose responses are watching you ("tweets").
This allows them to know whether they can monitor contributions, whether they are joining new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new form of Twitter was tested "in July at a small percentage of users" before it was expanded on Monday, AFP told Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with some incomprehensible terms (RT for repeated expansion of someone else's contribution, followfried for recommending to follow another user) thus opening up a wider public with a more comparable management than that of the large public Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" have different views on the importance of this innovation.
"It's essential, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function of the activity better helps me track down some of my Twitter features," @dannykronstrom sent.
Rakuusko
recording of the golden rule on the balance sheet to the Constitution
The Government of the Grand Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in force in Rakouska, decided to write a "gold rule" budget policy on a constitution with a view to reducing public deficits and avoiding such a downgrading of Rakouska by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the RAK debt is 74.6% higher than its maximum of 60% of the Maastricht agreement, but much less than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Rakouska's solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay every year three billion euros more," argued the Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindelleger.
This is how Austria refers to the application of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the chief states and governments have asked that by the end of 2012, the reduction of public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts are recorded in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Rakousque government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) each year, and the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while the total country, as well as the citizens, will have to show the same budget.
The objective is to obtain a public debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Only
Noda threatens new intervention on foreign markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to re-enter the foreign markets if it should only continue to strengthen.
"We'll figure out how we've done the last thing if we find too much instability" in the exchange course one explained to Senator Y. Noda.
On Tuesday he only re-entered the historical values which the Japanese authorities brought to intervention on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo sold only for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency, which has only recently won a record against the dollar due since 1945.
But since then he has been regularly engaged in the purchases of investors who consider him "safe" in the uncertain times of the global economic downturn and the European debt crisis.
The dollar was again received in the afternoon under 77 yen and the euro fell under the 105 yen symbolic flag, which resulted in the final intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This plans Japanese exchanges to damage export to the island, as it reflects the price of products from Made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenues obtained by Japanese companies from foreign companies when they transfer them to domestic exchanges.
"Japan is starving" from the experience of sudden earthquake and volcanic tsunamis that devastated the Tohok region in the northeastern country, highlighted Y. Noda, who fears that this outbreak will not be killed in the wake of a brief resurrection.
The world's third economic strength was restored in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter), first in one year due to the study of export growth and household consumption of the affected disasters.
But the Prime Minister insisted that the high value was not just a reflection of the "national economy of Japan".
Japan's Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ) to begin its two-day meeting on Tuesday with a view to adopting all possible measures leading to the weakening of the euro.
But the Deputy Governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that BoJ had already taken "relevant measures" indicating that no additional exchange deficit could be expected in the middle.
At its last meeting in October, the securities issue statute increased by 5,000 billion euros (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of state depository notes and raised the amount of 55,000 billion euros (519 billion euros) to purchase different securities with a view to shipping liquidity.
Eurozone:
The rates are rising, the bridges are moving.
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
By appointing new heads of government in Greece and Italy and by increasing growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
Europe's still worrying about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday 15 November, is falling into negative expectations.
In Paris, in 10 hours CAC index 40 loses 1.4% of points 3.064.
Index Dax in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new pressures around the profits of the eurozone states in difficulty, markets with shares around the world continue to produce only part of the recent profits."
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of harm," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker quoted by Reuters.
The turnout in Tokyo ended with a drop of 0.7%, which was suffering because of the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"As with the rest of the world, Japan has eyes on Europe and the exchange will only continue in the narrow corridor of variation until investors will have evidence that the situation is stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This re-starting uncertainty regarding the future of the euro area is damaging to the euro area itself, which continues in its fall in the afternoon.
The euro shall be reached at the lowest level from the time before and half a month and a half.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is $1,3570 at the rate of 0.4%.
According to the mackerel, the change occurred after the CDU's side of Angely Merkel's Chancellor at its Congress adopted a proposal on Monday to leave the eurozone for a country that is likely to be in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the limit 6%
The rent rates in Italy and Spain remain very disturbing.
This morning the result of the Italian ten-year bond is 6.85% and the result of the Spanish ten-year bond is 6.2%.
This pressure on the level of South European countries, but also in France, continues to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for three hours to make the situation in Italy a dangerously high level of debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October would be "the main task" of his government at the Eurozone summit.
Spain is once again in a relatively direct market when the elections are held in the country on Sunday in the parliamentary table.
The distinction of "spread" between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Expected number of euro area announced growth
Statistics say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter due to domestic consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the figure below the second quarter to decrease by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that the economy is most concerned.
On its part, Germany recorded an increase of 0.5% during the same period.
The first euro area estimates are expected within 11 hours, while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must win over dogma
If there is a subject that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term solutions or under emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural that the meeting at the elections would be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place where energy from the core is involved.
The debate will be successful only when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are already 7 billion human habitats on the planet, but demographic development is now generating a double demand for electricity by 2050 if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to save important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil fuels in order to continue to produce electricity, and it will not forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a view to combating climate change, which is an objective which is currently being eliminated from the ecological debate.
The accident in Fukushima has no impact on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany remains itself in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case with Belgium, which underlines its decision to find any other source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which considers it to be the right position only of the last generation.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to make decisions in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park on one unit by refurbishing an electric building destroyed after the accident of the Three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is ever presented as an example, the reality is opposed.
The Berlin Volbage is shown by the performance of electricity prices, increased energy dependence on electricity imported in particular from Russia, the rapid increase in CO2 emissions from electricity-derived construction on land and coal.
All these side effects are already felt within a few months.
The example of Denmark deserves our attention.
The European campaign in wind power stations, which collects 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest oil and gas consumers due to air irregularities, resulting in CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher than 65%, respectively 50% than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the immunities of our energy policy, our neighbour pays an electricity factor of 40% higher than the cost of paying French households.
While energy costs are a key factor in the globalised economy of energy, the French companies are benefiting from the most expensive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy share would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would result in an illusory declaration of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
The price that the majority of French refuse to pay is not as much against this energy as public opinion studies show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has enabled us to set up a sector of 125,000 direct jobs and with 440,000 jobs.
The heavily exporting industry is taking on international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the nuclear power plant, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have reached EUR 6 billion per year, which the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which electrical holder would order a nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years while the accident of his manufacturer was planned?
In resolving the energy equivalent, it must be admitted that there is no qualms for energy production, because there is no devil.
The development of low CO2 production facilities, nuclear installations and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French industry group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy resources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which conducts non-compromised and transparent surveillance of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new electricity in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognized have a sense of safety in blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has known three serious disasters.
The only in Three Mile Island happened under normal conditions of operation and remained without human sacrifice and consequences for the environment.
In the Chernobyl drama, the concept of reactors and inexhaustible human errors has been developed.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the disaster was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this disaster just as he did in two previous years.
The result of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of removing such pipes.
While all stakeholders who are willing to set up nuclear power are considered to stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be a great gift offered by the AREVA Group and EDF companies and allow the road to strengthen leading positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, concepts and machines dominate the debate so critical for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is the economy of immigration a problem or a chance?
The immigration policy carried out for Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised by various causes - the arrest of police, courts and administrative authorities of the specific policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", which France holds.
It was recently an administrative problem with foreign students who became current when the Minister of Interior (see Freedom letter of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talent, walls and servers".
But there were only a few of them in the economy.
I must say that in this area there is a lot of broad agreement between the left and the right.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac issued his statement that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrants are found" and on Michel Rocard's left when he said that France "cannot accept all the rest of the world".
The only difference is the degree of size
In 2005, fear from the invasion of the Polish capitals on the French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps immigrants are considered a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference starts in the degree of greatness that we are trying to provide to immigrants.
In his programme François Hollande is confined to banalities when he believes that joint development will help solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be paid in elections, but economics are very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remember in their recently published part of the most recent synthesis of migration knowledge (Excellent People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, page 352): There is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, prosperity and employment in countries where immigrants are receiving.
Restricting immigration protects growth and damage to employment.
The impact of affected migrants is based on the belief that these people can reward French workers, in particular those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their crops.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are actually much more complementary than employers for French employees because they are working in the less-off sectors.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors which do not belong to French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer a place.
Positive impact on the brain
Like a surgeon, there will be problems with work in the country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between France and migrants will cause immigrants' incomes to have a positive impact on the well-being and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% results in a long-term increase in real borders between 0.6% and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants is contributing to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US carriers of Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based immigrants).
Migrants are also the net contributors of social systems in European countries, on average up to 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany, one immigrant comes in 30 years of age to make a net contribution for the rest of his life in public budgets (receiving less expenditure) of EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to arrive for the missing percentage of growth "with refined teeth".
These teeth used to treat immigrants had a very negative effect.
Europe has found democracy, the rest of the industry of European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very poor goods.
The European continent should bear in mind this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, strikes, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that if democracy was definitely triumphing over its enemies, it would be enough to vote and do it the most direct way.
But it's known from Napoleon that it's been easy to think.
General voting law, perhaps a condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become a "pressure tool" as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and control of power, education, education, education, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is just as it has been since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the faults of the Greek referendum will be the value of the second resolution in this direction: the recognition of the need for a great return of political power, but also the recognition of the disturbing sense of its incompetence, its incompetence.
This ambivalentity must be considered in order to be overcome.
It is true that the main lines of democracy have been moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting at the right direction.
We cannot get anything if we demand a number of national rapporteurs arranged according to the need and organization.
Bianco set up by the European absoluteist monarch or jumped into an empty nationalist deep: what a choice for the citizens!
No, we don't want gilotine guns, but together, full of justice, peaceful and undisputed performance of elections and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the bill - because the crisis is in Europe.
This is the whole of Europe that is consistent with the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which is suffering from their inability and lack of solidarity.
This is all across Europe, which is humiliated at the international stage.
We are surprised at the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but this is a whole Europe which gradually loses its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
It is urgent to return to the management of the European project of democratic excellence.
Because only together will the Europeans have the power to reduce their debt, free market governments and to prepare for the future.
The outcome of the crisis will predetermine a decision at European level that will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to confusion.
After we have been fighting this Socialist and Jacques Delors' proposal for a long time, all of us today need a European economic government.
Wake up.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We need to take a new stage in European construction.
In order to produce a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republic.
The revolution in interest could not have been enough.
This lesson pays off.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more political democratic and genuine European democratic ideals.
Let's get to Europe to build Europe.
"Out of touch" chips are spread
In the optimistic atmosphere it opens on Tuesday in Villapinte near Paris a world-wide range of chips.
In 2011, according to the Eurosmart office, the increase in world sales of carats with microprocessors (bank card, SIM card phones) would result in 11% of more than 6 billion units.
The best thing is the non-contact technology segment that allows you to pay in collective transport or to cut purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world for 460 million chips against 320 million once a year!
In 2012, their share would still rise (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total market with chip cards (6,925 million carats).
After a long time in the APEC train, Europe is gaining ground in non-Contact pay.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75 000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France there are beginnings more modest: 400,000 visa-free cards were issued.
But big business grids work for two.
Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard this year.
To get a higher rate of speed, it's necessary for banks to train their customers from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distributing their credit cards to their customers in the future," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payment by mobile
But this is the first step towards the payment of the future: mobile phone.
The NFC (NFC) technologies needed to carry out the transaction are now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're getting late."
"But to their real range should come next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their world sales to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Bank of Credit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in the city of Caen, which takes place from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices will provide about 200 clients and employees with free online payment.
The BPCE Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And yesterday, the General Society also announced that it is preparing to make an offer that allows its customers to pay their mobile phone without charge.
The terrorist front from Sahary to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the alliances between Al-Kaydo in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long-term suspicion that there are alliances with the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria "has been safe from this."
"The way both organisations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
The investigation by two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help to clarify the linkage bridges.
Following the arrest of AQMI members from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their hostages during the operation by special French units.
In the hundreds of cases after the attack, French and Nigerian explorers had to find several telephones with chips of terrorists.
Terrorist part
The analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to Nigeria, which has long lived in Maiduguri, the city of northern Nigeria, which is a hill of Boko Haram, and the other to the man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It's a step forward, but it must certainly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active," Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and demonstration of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as those used by AQMI.
The international community in front of Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has faced.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities considered the group of enlightened mystics to be of little good interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the museums, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which means " Western education is sin", accepts the establishment of Islamism in northern northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has rapid success.
The sect is politically and requires strict adherence to Islamic law as its supporters engage in a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the Boko Harams became extremely active and attacked the police station.
The government's reaction is as usual still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the team Mohammed Yusuf is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and leaves its way north.
The 2010 festival will be held in the city of Jos, where 80 people are killed, next to the main city of Abuja.
In June it's again in Abuja, where Boko Haram is under police control during his first suicide attack.
And in July the local UN will be the first international target.
The creation of terrorist zones in Africa, which should be transported from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since concerned all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Kayda of the Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and the gamer and the Somalis from the Al-Shabáb strike in Kenya, Boko haram appears as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, during a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said France is in the state of readiness and is ready "to forward all information".
World by candidates to the president
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are presented in simplification and ignorance.
Can America’s weakened crisis fix the world with simple or even simple ideas?
In the hearing of presidential candidates, lovers could think of it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have echoed the ironic statements and expert guidance on foreign policy, which is already traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated conflicts about China, Iran, or Israel’s assistance are interfering.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened by calling Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "on account of manipulation with their currency", which is a nasal issue in America spread throughout its industry towards Asia.
It's worse if this has to contain the release of a business war in itself, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Prime Minister of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated foreign policy vision, was a little distracted by the existence of "express" emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last places in the polls, remains disobedient.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if they didn't succeed in halting his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'm a prisoner of Iran," he declared Fanfaron.
"If Obama is chosen again, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Obama of violating his obligations to this partner.
Deputy Herman Cain, the second best candidate to place, shows a tragic lack of documents.
He recently called for a sharpness against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently unknown facts that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to hit Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
All are far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opposers of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and still won a cold war.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the sudden departure of "boys" from Iraq, his speeches about Libya, and thereby add to him a weak attachment
But the attack is not quite easy.
The population is considering the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Ladin, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military principles that lead to corruption.
And with arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically so that its leading position can be restored, the Obama key to the right place.
Nord Stream, new entry point of Russian gas into Europe
A wave from the North Stream connecting Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the Baltic Sea day began to operate.
He has to add the gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gasprom, the Russian plynarian army, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Figuratively, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedév, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague, Mark Rutte, traveled together by the control of the Russian pipeline into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will start to flow to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas every year by the first effort of 1,224 km of the associated Petrohrad region with the Mecklemburg-Pomorian country.
The second pipeline to be completed by the end of 2012, allows to supply up to 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of putting the third gas pipeline on the same road.
For Gazprom, the temporary completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will be able to supply electricity directly to Germany without being driven across the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of putting pressure on Russia's threats of closing its access to the Western European market becomes more difficult for them.
Most powerfully, Warsaw failed to compare Nord Stream to "the new German-Soviet Pact", calling for an alliance between Hitler and Stalin at the occupation of Poland in 1939.
I mean, it means that it's politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater security of its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the price of energy undermining Europe because the project has created gaps between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia was finally able to extend its vision of a direct link between Russia and the rich Western states with high demand for electricity, whose logos are close to its end.
"This oil pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new heat that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the celebration of opening this pipeline and demonstrated in which large oil contracts are such as political and economic things.
All of this explains the broad smiles of the leading representatives of Gazprom who are present in a large number in Lubmin, the starting point of the current.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine is made of a steel concrete layer designed to protect against seagoing vessels.
It starts on the bottom of the sea in an average depth of 200 m.
During his construction, he had to avoid the mine field from the time of World War II.
"Because of their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The sole use is a long metal hat weighing 242 Eiffeloke, which has not been broken down anywhere by valves or maintenance stations.
One control area was to be built near Sweden, but the leading project refused when the Swedish were only a little interested in seeing the Russian state company on its borders.
"In the event of competition, we'll stop the flow of gas in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of a lack of moisture contained in liquid water, it shall be kept in the air.
However, this case was considered to be unlikely, since the votes were designed to cause uncertainty once over 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the exhaust pipe shall be carried out by the submarine robot attached to the vessel while the inlet of the pipeline is controlled by the device which circles inside.
This shower-shaped device of an average of 1 metre shall be fitted inside the tube and pressed by the gas.
For the purpose of all three days of the journey, the speed 3 m/s shall be provided with precise information on any deformation of the metal parts.
The donated gas was designed to function for 50 years without the need for self-rehabilitation.
The flow circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The driving position remains for Gazprom, which holds a share of 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as by the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The store has a seat in the city of Zoug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely good.
Gasprom subsequently acquired for five years a contract that can be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
"Tomorrow will benefit from total capacity, regardless of the amount of real transportable gas any," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction was ensured by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion in both cases.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned because they take the risk of taking only Gazprom.
Swimming from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with borough forests.
The windmills are four and a half feet high.
The cameraer shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before it is transferred to the German fluoride.
From the past Tuesday, this terminal receives every hour one million cubic metres of Russian gas.
When full capacity is achieved, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - signwriter
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to re-encourage writing.
It brings a wave of well-being, hours spent writing at the light of the light.
The Moleskine manuscript is easily distinguished by its black crossboards and its leaves send out white colors as early as age.
However, the writer of Moleskine, as we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo resident in Milan will then decide to place on the market a new designer but distinguished writer.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is interested in introducing a new product.
The writer is inspired by an old manufacturing technique "moleskin" ( skin imitation), which is used for example to fix the surface of the needle.
This type of writer was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has returned to the painting of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the Avantgard artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the lead character of Modo Mode company.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% in order to accommodate 12.7 million customers last year.
The situation is remote from the production of the first years when only 3,000 writers were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set up an art portrait of the buyer, because the writer is busy business as much as a student or professional.
The image of the writer of Moleskine is that its owners are people of space policy, cultivation and open spirit.
A small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now has almost one hundred and two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sent his writers into the library and through the FNAC retail network into small shops in the middle of the city where he was able to pass his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the explosive development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature provides the development of the writer of Moleskine: recently the sign opened the exhibition "Handing", where architects or artists are presenting their writer.
In July, at the time of the film festival in Locarna, she also introduced a new tab to a writer who remembered the Leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, papers, jars, notes... The label is spread across a series of containers.
The success that led to the rise: in the autumn of 2006, Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there so much of the unemployed workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today, the 15th week of employment for mended persons is open.
Over the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005 the percentage of unemployed persons is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% around 9% for the entire population.
Is that a phone call?
"No, supported by éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the Job of Handicrafts."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time there was no percentage of unemployed people twice, but three times higher."
"But there's still much more to do."
It should be said that for unemployed persons, there are many obstacles to their access to work.
This is about older people: 37% is over 50 years (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% don't have math, and only 10 000 people from 2.3 million high school students are disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in the handshakeed average of 38%.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent "the core problem", according to Christiana Grapin, director general of the Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help companies accept disabled workers.
So much when it comes to objective noise.
There are still unspoken ways of thinking that certainly develop, but too little.
A study conducted in the IMS-Entreprenere pour la Cité found that the manager's questions have a low level of knowledge about persons with disabilities" with a 'overexploited view of persons on driving and mental or mental disabilities'.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the goal of employment of 6% of disabled workers under the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 represent 2.6% of the figure.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director general of the Agefiph organization entrusted with the selection of fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence shows that the number of "carried" companies, as well as the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, is 59,000 of the affected companies per 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of employees with between 20 and 49 employees are employed with 82% of employees with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a lucky thing"
Before the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were elected on Tuesday evening (20h45), they did not hide the joy that this friendly approach would bring them.
Let's not go so far as to write that there's been a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to them at the Stade de France lookout court, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard were short-lived.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the game against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am with Eden and his progress very calm, and the fact that he loves his country is true."
"I want to move forward," says the French Lille player.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in club sports and national men's sports, "it's the same and it's the same, it's just right."
"I've been in Lille all year, which isn't the case with Belgium."
"It takes me to clear my mark."
Hazard, who was shot against Romania on Thursday night for this game against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "crazed".
You can't remember the concept of "joy."
Play against Blaus, who has been inspired by 7 years and in their winnings in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan." He says.
This will necessarily contribute more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More than that, because they're against Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), remember.
"We crossed it right away."
"The power to play against him, it's just pleasure!"
Well done, Leekens said "horst".
"Herdost" to fight "the Covenant - the Holy."
"Herdost" also found in the quality of neighboring countries, that France has become a very high-level team for more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc did a huge job," he woke up.
Maybe Belgium will miss Europe's next mission, a technical footballer would like to see you in 2014 in a plane with France... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy."
"Recognize this for next match." including against France.
Portugal Very Private
The Portuguese poet Paulo Bento starts with a great optimism against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way to both teams, there was a lack of realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it. The Portuguese football representation, with its cormide since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal shares happiness in 90 minutes.
There's one game left to play and one match to Bosna.
In the knowledge of the fifth result (0-0) in the evil Bosnian Zenica it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal must have been more than an hour of movement, but it was not able to give him such a rare neck that he would be able to handle.
"It's a good result that still contains the risk because we haven't gone out."
But at home at their great Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, Portugal is convinced that it will appear before the public that it should create a hot cat there, even though the game is definitely called "very balanced," says an optimist, but the castles that consider Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a proposal," said a 40-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50% chance to be on the euro 2012," Carlos Queiroze relativized.
Undecided five-day game in Bosnia encourages Portugal to win and win.
Undeterred play can be enough for Bosnians who also need to sing.
"It's a good result, however, that contains the risk, because we haven't gone out," Bento laments.
"We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
Like in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think."
A good idea, provided that this time it will prove to be realistic.
