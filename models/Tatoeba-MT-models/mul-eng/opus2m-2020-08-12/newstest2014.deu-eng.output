Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 footpath was taken into operation at the village parking lot - in view of the older rata sample.
Two installations are so close to each other: purpose or lifeline?
This question has been answered by Mr Gutachs Mayor yesterday.
"The Ratha sample was installed at the time because it is safe in school," explained Eckert last night.
The Kluser appel secures both bicycles and bus guests and the Bergel residents.
The facility officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, body park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‹Grub«.
"When the high traffic and pedestrians arrived, their safety had to be further stepped up," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Landrammt Offenburg.
"On average, according to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles per day take over the Community of Gutach, of which about 10 per cent are heavy cargo traffic," notes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another ampel is more than necessary: "Safety is going ahead," says Arnold.
In total, four traffic inspections were carried out, and a circuit traffic was also considered, but the angles in the crossing area of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße were re-designed.
It was said that Arnold was tested at the location selection of the ampel masts first: "We have tested whether these vehicles can be driven from the sulzbachway to the B 33 without turning the ampel masts".
About EUR 15 000 of your appellate facility itself is the "modernest thing on the market at present", explained Arnold.
The facility is equipped with colorful LEDs that shed so powerful that the lights from the car drivers are also well known for the deep sun.
And it's also bright: The older lights consume about 100 watts, which just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems for driving.
Arnold explained the technology of the new facility: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the walker pushes the button, the higher radar sensor tests the traffic.
If the road is free, green comes directly to the pedestrian if it doesn't take about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor will check whether the ground phase can be completed for the footstep.
"If a group of people or people are to go across the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be sure about the train," Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and watch the train.
This wasn't the case yesterday: hardly showed the apple for footmen green, an overclass vehicle ran through - at light red.
Josef Winkler has written for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophe of his Catholic villagehood - the languagelessness, the hang of cruel violence and stupid sexuality, the gang and the joylessness - has been described many times by the newspaper poet.
The bookmaker is known primarily as the prosaator, the theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher sets out for his performance "Servelights on the Song Spectrum", which is now seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, so a collage from Prosa texts together.
The theatremaker combines some elements from the autobiographically-distributed novel "The Leibegine" (1987) with prosaminations from "Leichnam, his family", (2003).
On the wide empty stage - an important requirement: a circular sofa, which is cooperating and masturbating in the way it is cut and masturbated - the eight-piece collection is covered by the text material.
In this case, the editor of Fresacher seems to be less confident about the text.
The 70-minute performance overflows the presentation with a full range of registries, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic games.
In particular, the players come in the middle of some questionable Chinese performances.
They are firmly fixed, with their head covered under water, with their shoulders attached to the wall.
Intensified in Zellophan or Mieder, they are exposed to dangerous high particles by insinuation, either monologise loud or lie completely concocted on the ground floor.
However, the text does not appear to be so strict.
The best moments have the night when it's sleeping - the band width ranges from Deep Purple to too popular music.
Only against the end comes the overbearing performance comes to rest, and Winkler's sudden absurd humor turns on.
A blackbox in the car?
U.S. street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that finds in the armature board every car's place.
The devices that record each kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the focus of a controversial attempt by Washington and the U.S. planning offices to review the old US road financing system.
The normal longer-term area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with strong alliances.
Libertaires have joined environmental groups and talk about using the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometers – and possibly even where they have been threatened – and then using the information for the calculation of tax returns.
The Tea Party is now.
The U.S. Civil Law Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has a number of data protection concerns.
However, while it is impossible to make progress at the convention, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently checking how they can change into a system for the next ten years to pay the driver per assigned mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing to be used just as much as possible," said Hassan Ikhrata, director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who has been planning a list of dangerous miles for all California motorists in the United States since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by the tax, is responsible for the US-US contribution to the Zappsale.
But in America it is no longer thought of as much as it used to be.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not been increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not carry taxes at high rates, even for one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not possible in the future," said Lee Munnich, an expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with driver's licenses to test a mel-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
The bureaucrats refer to it as a mail-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal attacks, for example, the tax has been used to influence driving behaviour so that noise and climate damage are reduced.
The California planners set out the system for the development of strategies with which the aims of the federal state are to be achieved in order to achieve the objectives of the proposed, legally agreed climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shutter of Pennsylvania, President of the House Transport Committee, also stated that he saw the most long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of letting drivers pay for their return.
"This is no tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Policy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in a report to the Congress in 2011 urged themselves to move towards melan-based retirement.
Last year the US Senate approved a 90 million dollars worth of pilot project, which would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the president from reacting to the concerns of delegates from rural areas, who often have to return many miles on the road to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities, however, are moving on their own road in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which is currently running 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paid the measles instead of mineral oil tax to the United States.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, which is composed of 17 Federal Ministry of Transport of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could follow every move.
"Remembering Big Brother and such things was a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of the strategy and performance management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test was submitted, the ACLU of Nevada warned its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into advanced surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, fragmented technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is part of a number of States that now look at fast technology with which the State can take the dangerous kilometers, but not exactly where and where.
So, as Khan, the public would be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally represented to assist the United States in the control of motor vehicles.
Rather, it was her goal to be caught in an emerging market for Kfz insurance feet where drivers should pay on the basis of the dangerous miles.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that will be regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made a big mistake.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting to give car drivers a number of options.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no equipment at all and instead pay a break-down fee on the basis of the average mileage of all citizens of the state.
Others hope to sell the concept of a mysterious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a control device that also allows them to pay parking fees, they have to pay insurance only for dangerous mileages and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time, thanks to the car driver's station.
"A car drivers would be motivated by the majority of the benefits offered by the system to participate," says a city planning document.
However, some transport planners wondered whether the whole tool of payment per mile was not just a huge manoeuvre.
In the case of the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, the Congress could simply solve the problem of the highway trust fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single fee or an annual allowance could be charged to motor vehicles with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume low petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explained Randy Rentschler, the Commission's law director and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers care about their privacy and many other things.
King's Field: Small Man's Fighter
The volunteer firefighter handled her her hairhead test despite personal deficiencies with Bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
The division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen in his exercise the presence of Feder in the Burgberger Street.
There's supposed to be a short-term closure at the end of the season.
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and the development of smoking, but one of them was able to send another note.
After the first inspection of the floor by Hans Kammerer, two air-protectors were ready to attend the building.
In a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to freedom.
The second person had to be taken.
This was not so easy, since it was also a hard step to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated location for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It contained lots of wood and also woodballs.
There were still electrical machines for wood processing.
The first blast hit the tank in the vehicle.
A further direction was made over an overfluorinated hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Three solution attacks could not be performed.
For use there was also a wooden beam in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went on to show what is to be done with little staff available.
In the event of pregnancy, there is support for the day-to-day work group King's field.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
On his visit to the rural district of Breisgau-Hochwarzwald, Landday President Guido Wolf also told Titisee-Neustadt about where the labour force came from tomorrow.
In the centre of promotion, Hochschwarzwald, he went along with the business leaders of the vocational schools as well as the Creisgymnasium and the parental councillors of this important issue.
"Education is an important position factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Highwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration in the forest city between the Fodder Centre, the Creisgymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family friendship in the countryside.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also because of the demographic change, the phase for the care of members," said Wolf.
He also pointed out that more and more people were concerned about the care and care of their employees.
"Without the support of the employer, the resulting pressure on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified labour forces, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during his study, his acquired knowledge and skills are often given to the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," said the president of the region.
Because only if adequate training facilities are offered, the need for expertise can also be met.
In his view, the local advantage of the rural crisis is its beneficial position in the southwestern Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already under way to develop public transport on his way from Titisee-Newstadt to Freiburg.
"Keep up your pace and make sure that public transport becomes better," he said to the address of the existing municipal policies.
With music, you experience a memorable afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the elderly to coffee, cook and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were judged in the orphanage.
In the meantime, this afternoon will be held at St. Joseph's.
The inhabitants enjoy the beautiful kitchens and gardens.
Later there was Wurssalat.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, were under normal tunes.
The older natural stone walls over 100 years of age, as a prior limitation of the old school in front of the sanatorium, are to be reimbursed with the city’s sanitation cost plan.
In the days prior to the Kilbig, during the first work of the former school sanatorium, a small factory wall was built for the stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with ballustrade over one hundred years old.
The next step is so that Alexander Misok from the Bräunling City Building, to involve the country's memory in planning and to create a healing concept for the old walls.
A cost calculation should then be carried out by experts, which should then be placed on the table to the Community Council for the decision and determination of further progress.
A decision on this is likely to be taken in the coming year.
After cleaning, planting and planting of the old school complex within the two sides of the school built in 1912, there must be a resounding time as a follow-up measure, which is based on the need for sanitation and new infrastructure.
The historical, one hundred years old barrier wall of the old school hall to church street is especially caused by water and frost damage, since there is no draining, sanitation is necessary and there is an increase in noise.
Deep roses in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk.
A permanent wall is a condition for one of the students to use a school hall, which is carried out by the current construction works.
It was originally planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure resulted in a breakdown.
An important word in the historical school-builder sanatorium, which has even been used for film taking, will be spoken by the country's memory.
If standards come from this page, then the city would hope to protect the memory guards.
The students of Brüunling's primary school, who are taught in a well-known old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school.
Özdemir wants to receive Jazza training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has also been involved.
"I think it's wrong to give all the training in the Stuttgart Music School," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and Classic are just at the jazz place Stuttgart together.
This is why Özdemir, who serves as a minister in Stuttgart for a direct term at the German election on 22 September, is opposed to the Green Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the jazz and pop course should be reduced from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
US border: "Super-Tunnel" discovered to drug abuse
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a "super-tunnel" for drug abuse.
As the US customs authorities reported, more than 500 metres of track between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, railways and a power plant.
Three suspects were subsequently arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel was not yet used as a result.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig through the radar," said the U.S. state attorney general of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy said to the drug gangs: "If you continue to build such a tunnel and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a constant fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Built by experts
Due to the continued equipment of the tunnel, the investigators point out that it was built by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year ago.
The installation was so equipped that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side is access to a building which is 80 metres away from the border.
According to authorities, a leader leads 20 meters deep into the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a circumference of 1,20 meters high and 90 cm wide.
It would also be appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the rape of Marihuana.
All three deserve the highest penalty of life-long freedom, as officials have said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it has continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building.
Normally cocaine is washed in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "disquieting" of drug gangs whose traditional routes are intertwined, Bill Sherman of the DEA drug race in San Diego said.
They'd do everything they could to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one hundred Mexicans.
You have to count with prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 will be the year of the year of Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen in 1250.
The return of the first official reference is always closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the Jubilee year will end.
Geisingen and Church Houses were mentioned for the first time in an informal manner.
In the church, an auction was made in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March, there will be an official appointment for the Jubilee year, and since there is no hall at present, this event will take place at the place where both of us were first mentioned 1250 years ago in church houses.
As part of the Jubilee, various events are planned both in geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a festival from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrate the feast.
On Friday with a festival, Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
This festival is also the church-houser church festival.
The city's director, Rudolf Barth, has written for the city on the basis of the Jubilee, an order for three terms.
On 21 June, together with the Sundry Festival of the Schwarzwald Association, on 12 July in the arena with firework and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival.
This will be completed and extended in the Jubilee year, the official term is last September on 27 and 28 September.
A new Chronicles will also be issued following the construction of the Geising City Building.
"But it should be a chronicle not only by geisinging itself, but by a printed work on the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, Church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And even today's geisings celebrates the birthday of 2014, 1974 was completed with the integrations.
The new Chronicle will then be presented at the new Festival on 21 or 22 November.
However, 2014 is also another year with many Jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with an evening of use due to its 60-year-old existence, the harmony of Gutmadingen is 90 years old and has the party banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School is in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the musicver Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the spring festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first officially mentioned in a drawing studio owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The case was made in church (houses), which was then a court.
Therefore, both municipalities are mentioned in the same context.
In 2014, this 1250-year-old celebrates accordingly, in addition, the common form is still back for 40 years.
The Council takes care of all the facilities in the viewer
Whether the "Am Hirsch" transition should be reversed to increase traffic safety
Yes, the Community's members have decided.
However, €220,000 has to be taken into account.
The German railway will improve the Kinzigtal train route in the coming year.
In particular, safety at railway stations should be increased - on a regular basis it comes to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the Communities are to vote in favour of the restructuring measures, they must participate with a third party at the cost of sharing the rest of the railway and bond.
Schiltachs townhouseister Roland Griäßhaber explained to the council the particulars of the "Am Hirschen" railway tour.
There the city is planning to build an outlet in the height of the tunnel in the west of the railway line.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as longwood transporting, standing in the opposite direction without having to block the ice.
The owner therefore decided to build a necessary wall so that the city could extend the road to time given to ensure a free flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the Council of Controversy, as some Councils challenged the need for road distribution in doubt: Thomas Kipp brought with him the vote of critics on the point: "Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The train crossing "Hirschen" will be used on a regular basis for longholz transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly over this route because vehicles up to 20 metres could not use the roads at the port bridge because they could not get off the main road there.
In addition, the tracks serve as a guide for vehicles which cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued Haas.
Since it appears that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel had to be built and cleaned, as is now in Wolfach's case, the "Am "Hirschen" can also become an important means of transport for a longer period.
The wheels agreed to be examined at what costs would cause the intended expansion of the road.
In spite of this, the construction of the train crossing was largely agreed with the measure that the necessary wall is being built so that the city can build the following road, "road" if necessary, for road traffic at about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the construction of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwin could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the passage into the growing "Gerolthouse Road".
The administration had been able to investigate the construction plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, since it had doubts whether the planned connection to the Gerolthouse road was still possible.
The investigation has led to the fact that it is not excluded that the road conditions could lead to a longer seating of vehicles.
The responsibility for this was once again to bring the city into line with the road.
The restructuring could therefore result in debt disputes.
Since both wood consumption and deforestation have been operating in the current state of construction, it is not appropriate to agree to the re-construction of the railway crossing, as argued by Haas.
Also at this point is the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle which is moving significantly lower than the other railway stops, as it is directly centred on the point of view.
Even trains from the main train station had to be in this place as far as it's slowed down as possible that no collision would take place.
Mostly, the construction of this road crossing was refused, since the city of Schiltach had to "extend" the problem with existing vehicles, so that the wheels could withdraw after the construction of the railways had been completed.
As a matter of fact, the Gremium considers that the constructions at the railway stations "For Heubach" and "For Kuhbach" have already been reached for the crossing agreements with the railway.
Esa decides on major global missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be chosen, five are still in the race.
Farne Welten.
More than 1,000 planets with other stars have already been found.
If there are at least some of these lives, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or were you looking for a mindless planet and perhaps discovering a foreign life?
These questions are just the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For your "Cosmic Vision" program, you are looking for ideas for two large space projects that should make research very important.
The state for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 Ideally, five of them have now come into the worst choice.
A number of germs have criticized the proposals which have been made in research.
The next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, the Esa has chosen four major questions on which the missions to find answers to the "Cosmic Vision" programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact developments in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the verbal darkness.
A big infrared telescope in All could pass this dark.
And if a star has planets, what circumstances can lead to life there?
To address this issue, 2017 will launch the World Space Telescope "Cheeps", with the 500 already known planet systems in our next environment.
The options are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could create deep planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and search for "biomarks": gases that are considered as an index for biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also be finalized on what conditions there are for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its partial radiation with the planet's system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary way.
With the "Sular Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-class (where the budget is located at about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The sun should start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also very interested in Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, Esa is the first of three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it will reach Jupiter and will explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the exotic moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under which all the known laws of nature are united.
How did the universe come into existence and exist?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Orknall.
In addition to the material that we have, from the stars, planets and living things as we exist, there are dark matter that combines gravity with galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the world.
Until then, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first half of the earpieces of the ear, nor do there exist dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M-mission which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the universe and thus enable the creation of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Only two of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best opportunities for approval as a L-mission have, in the opinion of many experts "E-Lisa", a demanding concept of proof of gravity waves.
These include physical changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They weren't shown up until today.
Elisa could create it, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission has a two or three-second detector that is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, it could also show gravity waves created by the urcanella and thus provide new insights about the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large radio telescope named "Athena", which is to explore among other black holes, "Icy Planets", a further mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Presm", a mission to measure the cosmic background, and the "Exoplanet Finder" of the mind planets.
There are already some proposals for the re-transmission of Mars, for the research of Moon, Venus and Asteroids, and for solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, explained that he was ready to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Federal Day when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander gave no answers to their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss his statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government still treats a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalize political opinion with criminalizing punishment, where there is no defence."
But the truth is no crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the US government to let the charges come against him.
The complaint filed by the US Ministry of Justice includes spying and dibstal of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding time online: "When Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German representatives, we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the United States and Germany is burdened by the allegations that NSA has heard the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opermann, the member of the committee responsible for the Secret Service Committee, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if it is possible to "without endangering him and ruin his relationship with the United States".
Ströbele, an editor of the Greens, published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbel stated that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden looks out in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he's there "safe", says the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he sees a “contained and continuing” persecution campaign that has driven him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – even in the United States – have referred to speculations about an uncontrollable system of comprehensive monitoring as a service to the public.
In his letter, Snowden provides the German authorities with an offer of cooperation, "when difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation".
Frontier Airlines pays for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 of passengers who want to hide on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of handbag and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to be read in the notice on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire dose.
The new fee is applicable for handbags in the bag over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that you would calculate $25 if the fee would be paid in advance, and $100 for passengers who paid only on the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the $100-dollar fee was intended to move travellers in the field to care for the payment.
"We do not want to calculate these sums," she said.
Air carriers started in 2008 to charge charges for the first and second items listed.
Passengers who tried to move these have thus stopped as much as possible into the handbag, which has resulted in the pack bags being often filled over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee doesn't really cost money.
It is about the most reliable customers of Frontier who had made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place in the profession over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight path of Frontier may take a package free of charge, which the next person must pay for a comparable package.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
The new Frontier package fee is only in force in the summer, and there is no specific date yet.
Passengers often change over packages and other charges, but airlines would like to take it back.
They argue that transport of the package costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many on the Wall Street consider the new package fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, most of them still leave their fingers for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as the first fee for handbags and then followed Alligiant Air, also a ticketer.
The only other airlines with such a fee were the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who follows closely the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit's package fee would bring $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who had previously held a lead position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what he would expect at the airport if passengers were faced with the company's unusual handling fee.
"The boarding process belonged to the restless ones I've experienced in my career in the air," he said.
I expected to see dozens of experts and handcuffs on the plane.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the board loved it as it smelled."
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep all the doses and be filled with coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but it returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company was followed.
Frontiers Step, to raise fees for the package if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with the customers to be reached on their own website.
Flight companies pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from an online travel office instead.
Frontier has, however, gone the farthest way in this area.
In September, the company began to offer only half of the many multi-flight emails when booking about an online travel office.
On Wednesday the miles were again reduced to 25 per cent of the flight routes.
A third-party flight trip with frontier over 1000 miles brings only 250 miles to customers.
Passengers can also only be booked on Frontier places on the website when shopping directly.
Frontier has a reliable customer reputation at his seat in Denver, but the business is broken and the company loses money.
The solution went back by 9 percent and the flight capacity collapsed by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as is read in the financial report published on the midweek of the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has tried to obtain the funds of Frontier in the grip of the company's sale.
Words That Come From the Bible
Good 40 women visit the last morning of this year in the Evangelical Church Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church was "words from the Bible" and "meanings from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the president of the church council, went to the Bible speakers after breakfast.
"Speakers include lifestyles, rules or warnings," she said.
She compared several words with the corresponding Bible texts and explained the meaning.
She called words like: "Let the trees grow up, as the arrows of the eyes fall down, make an eye on someone whose eyes are in the Lord's sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
Many times, the speakers also advised their audience what language it was.
The references from the Middle Ages included church leaders Christel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, make something worse.
She explained the meaning and origin of the discourses she called "Braces in the Past".
To conclude, a tombola was lost.
The prices were covered on a table and were rewritten with humor before they were transferred to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the mayor's candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: Pilot project for young people in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Seaboard, a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched.
Under the direction of the Federal Labour Agency 49 women and men who are already working as minors in the industry are to be qualified for professional strengths for hotels and hostels via three winters.
"It's new that the six-month course ends with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Agency.
The benefits were diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, which would prevent companies from being forced to engage in professional activities that were increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Industrial and Commercial Chambers in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Guest House Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains a "internal error" and no hacker is responsible for crashing the website
The shadowy National Security Agency explained on the late Friday, an error has slowed down its public website for hours and not hacker, as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available this night for several hours, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the loss was caused by a distribution of DDoS was not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers found that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
A spokesman from the NSA against ABC News stated that the sensitive internal network of the Authority had been "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, as is the speaker.
At least one group of hackists claimed to have let the NSA website relax with a DDoS attack.
For such attacks, the target website will be overloaded with page calls until the server is overloaded and the website will be compiled.
Cybertech is relatively simple and the attacks do not need to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose name was first named No Search Agency (No such authority), is located in the light of the public and looks at the findings of its extensive monitoring programme in the past months – a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by former NSA employees Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service threatened initial speculations about what happened today was the result of a planned operation.
Slowly reduced is the number of people without a job in October 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota with 3.1 per cent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more but more," says Monika Fielder Farmer, company manager of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have responded to settings for a long time.
One reason for this is that "we have no expertise in handwork, health care and care".
Annual conditions have also been in place since September for staff in hotel and guest rental.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report will be found in the Allgeuer notice page of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Gains in the case of Bombardier after return on delivery payments and contracts
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decrease in the net gain on Thursday after it was hit by reverse orders and deliverys for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway lot.
Bombardier with seating in Montreal also did not publish any flight data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable in next September.
On the young flight of the test aircraft within one and a half months, only three more pilots followed up, which would cause the test phase to appear asking whether the test phase is going on as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course of over eight per cent on the Toronto bridge.
Cameron Doerssen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sector performance" on Thursday in order to ensure that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"We are clearly disappointed by the development of the margin in transport," Doersken said in a customer letter.
We believe that new orders for CSeries will be received by Bombardier when the test program for the aircraft is advanced.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after monthly delays for the first time in September.
Until then, however, binding orders for CSeries are moderated by 177 as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight test and want to see whether the company's claims regarding the cost-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the new passenger vehicle are applicable.
At present there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also ensured on Thursday against analysts and the media that the programme is in the deadline.
"The test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft's time was on the ground service and software updates.
Each manufacturer plants differently.
We have decided to undertake a first flight and then to extend a processing period, as we have done.
This is happening during the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft will be expected to start in the next weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was on the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical whether a CSeries aircraft can be operated 12 months after the first customer's flight.
Bombardier stated that it will review the business plan (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight effort – even if they are obviously in line with internal planning of Bombardiers – strengthens our view that the start-up is moving towards the first quarter of 2015,” Doersken said.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30, Bombardiers won the net win at 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cent per share last year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged by 9 cent.
The turnover was slightly down and down from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a 10 cent per share and a turnover of $456 billion, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's largest four-larger aircraft manufacturer, he has spent 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fall from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order file in the air and space transport lot was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged against 31 December.
"In the field of air and space travel, the results of our standards, but the low procurement and market conditions as a whole were discouraging," said Beaudoin.
The sales in air and space transport parties fell by 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that the trade in this sport has increased by nearly 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order file in the transport lot was $32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased against 31 December.
The advantages of transport have been affected by problems of decommissioning in some large contracts.
According to company management it will be given new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier stock increased by 8.5 per cent and stood at $4.83 Canadian dollars, even after it was announced that Google Finance President Patrick Pichette would change into the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial airliner and the first Rival of Bombardiers, reported a 10-percent decline in the quarter winning on Thursday.
USA: Shoots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning.
While the airport management reported on the short news service Twitter, the protection was in danger, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security officer was also killed.
In addition, media reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama will be informed about the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident took place in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they had seen a protection with a threat in one of the refugee camps, as several media reported.
A traveler told the sender CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers had screamed and killed children.
Among the waiters were panicked, many had been hiding from fear behind bars.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of "Los Angeles Times".
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered an explosion at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Then he himself was brought into a security area, the man reported.
The shells should be near a security control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television screens, it was seen how many hospitals and police cars were driving ahead of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken safely from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special application order and a threat on the ground.
As the flight guide reported on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. (Ordertime).
The roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, formed a long backstage.
As long as the air traffic has been temporarily fixed on landings, it would have been.
However, several pilots were also to be observed at the start of CNN.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
The cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss before police investigation must be imprisoned.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on the world's size Neil Scarborough further
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron before a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug search could be discovered was sentenced to three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided world-wide Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his drug-trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine search.
The first-class lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police were monitoring Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three cocaine bottles were delivered at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while she and her colleagues were eating at a meal of the lawyer's room.
The findings indicated that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after having been found on her hair, on her letter bag and on credit cards at tests.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to create information about the arrest of two men in the order of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police under a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other persons, they were arrested later after the police secured $1.5 million in a series of home searches for heroin and cocaine and 200,000 in cash.
Dita, 42, provided information to the criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction could be published.
Today, Ditta, who worked for the Canzlei Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and condemned at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two cases due to obstacles to justice.
In an earlier question, he added the cocaine possession.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that this had been in regular contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two intelligence officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas' house and placed the drugs with a 60 per cent purity in a black golf course under the cover of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Stadium in Ewood Park during the evenings.
The lawyer returned home, stopped the drugs, and nine messages were exchanged between the two.
Before the court it was known that Dita was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after having been discovered in her hair, letter bag and credit cards during tests of Class A drugs.
Dita was later arrested but argued to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the supposed dealer because this was his mandate, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the “advisory secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his letter bag and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was removed from a hair sample.
At the police station, he offered to operate both under his private address and at work an office and agents would call him home because of legal matters.
It was announced before the Court that he had called for important actors of the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, after considerable arrests and had informed the investigators of what they knew about them.
State lawyer Anne White said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not being passed."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has been very involved with certain agents.
The question is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his statements were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
However, this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between a lawyer and a man.
He acted as far as possible against the police investigation so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore appealed his case.
He was too close to certain mandate holders, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta showed every misunderstanding and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who didn't want to give information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
After hearing, however, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he started buying drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him available for the motivation of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to include valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Dita has abandoned this trust and tried to escape behind the fascade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Dita, which also led to a trial in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the detention of justice, which undermines our determination to bring criminal proceedings before the court.
This case should be a warning and shows that no one can escape the law's arms.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty-three other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug abuse.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about what he said was his dream job to represent as an attorney of the U.S. death cells, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chances equality is the motivation for his work.
The revolutionary work of the Church of Music
At the end of the festivities due to its 160-year-old existence, the sound krenz Dunningen will serve two divine services with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the "Rock my Life" musical, which the audience enjoyed this year in the spring, the song choir will ensure two divine services at the end of the Jubilee year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary event will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martinuche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. in the service of God in St. John Baptist Church in Lakedorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Gesangs for the Festival of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D.872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and is almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The exhibition will be presented in the framework of God’s service, as it was in the minds of Commander Johann Philipp Neumann.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the group of musicians Fforhsinn Tennenbrunn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haaslach: Skepsis weighs on the horizon
For example, with the 2015 elections to the Pharmacopoeia Council, Haslach (SE) will be fundamentally modified in the brain care unit.
Then there is only one single parish council for all six couples.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the vegetables from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welchensteinch were prepared for the changes.
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is for the parishioners to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it was particularly clear that the creations against the new were weighting but looking forward to a perspective.
From the proposals and expectations for the 2015 updates to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the Pharmacovigilance Council, the most constructive discussion of the six Gremies with the chief of the team is made.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for self-sustainment units in Erzdiöz Freiburg with a presentation.
Then the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far.
It will only be provided by a joint parish council and a founding council, in which the priest's power is represented.
Of each pair, at least two elected members should be represented, in which six couples are formed before the place.
It will be your task in the future to promote church life in the place.
In the case of the financing of the individual parish community, there was a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected mushrooms remain bounded in the pharmacovigilance.
On the other hand, the bonds are passed on to the whole community.
Only with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment to meet all the pharmacovigilance, there was great concern.
"In the past it was also invested only in projects that could be handled by individual pharmacovigilants alone," related Háslach, president of the Pharmacopoeia Council, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common Gremium for five pfarries depicted Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the Gremium in the unit of soul care Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had done the task in 2006, "One will stay five" and had to determine that this is not even that simple.
The grasslands of Haslacher's brain care unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint horse industry as well as the practical work of the Community teams.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six Greens in the coming spring.
At the end, Pfarrmenderet Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the unit of soul care, which was approved by a significant majority.
In Pfullendorf the power tower becomes
Citizens of Pfullendorfs must set themselves at higher electricity costs.
As the city's business leader, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, comes at a four-pupplendorfer family from 70 to 90 Euro multicosts per year.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the rise in the so-called EEC balance of 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This installation will be re-established every year by the four operators of the major power stations in October.
These relate to the multi-costs arising from the energy supply which can be raised by a conversion over the electricity price.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last slide in this chain.
The Board of Supervisors of the Energy Company was in its projections even from a higher turnover, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the specific payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be closer to 2 cents.
Amber on Duration: Watch on Time
Sometimes a apple will just not be green.
The contact tape in the street does not respond, or the light signal is defective.
So what should you do - when you're driving?
If a concerned person has waited long enough on a red apple and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart legal lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorcycle".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate" which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker is able to take off at least five minutes before it is taken out of a malfunction of the ample.
However, those who continue the journey despite red light must be aware that they bear the full responsibility for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who has been patient for less than five minutes is not long enough, Becker warns and points to a decision of the Supreme Court.
In the case of negotiations, a driver had ignored the ampel after about three minutes and had to answer for a fatal red light loss.
The ampel was not defective, but pushed a little later on Green.
A ban on driving remained on him because of the special situation - but the penalty was not.
The Council is pleased with the strong budget
Every time it comes to the budget at Community meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The community shelter in Herdwagen-säönach is well filled and debt is no longer known by the administration since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as a complete success in this regard.
This was clearly demonstrated in the preparation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of about EUR 7.6 million has been higher than planned.
The administrative budget's surplus is also around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
In particular, the surplus is due to higher tax revenue and the Community share of income tax.
The amount of the asset was also significantly higher than the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially at the highest administrative level," said Rothmund.
Since less investments have been made than planned in the financial year 2012, the return on returns has also been higher.
Overall, the overall balance could now be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"So a work doesn't just protect one from the heat," praised Gerster with a view to the year's accounting.
He and the members of the Community are obviously pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but exactly these good numbers could soon bring the citizens closer.
By means of the good financial situation, the Community was able to rely on high taxes in the past.
However, according to Gerster, the country's funds have already been cut more frequently.
There are conditions for these grants from different balance sheets.
In particular, the cities and communities which apply for grants must provide certain housing provisions.
"We need to look at the issue of housing as investments that we would like to make in the coming years," announced Gerster in this connection.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter 60 years ago in Chor
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the male singer Cécilia has almost doubled as long as the herb party in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his male singer on the stage.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with his favorite choir.
Wermter was also active in the Union, among other things, for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and union, he received a number of awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral referee in the order of the Cécilienverande Rottenburg-Suttgart, handed him over - since the choir is also a church choir - an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the skills of the German choir band as well as a heavy censor.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Herbstfest in common streets: with the MGV Betra, the sound krenz Salzstetten, the singing section of Basingen and the local music club, the full-timers had loaded a combined mix of different choirs and sound styles, which the about 400 visitors attended.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with voice-filled songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Sudden, Your Brother".
Your noble singer Hubert Wermter prepared another small stop for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts "Bundeslied".
The Men's Singer Betra also sings classical chor Leaders such as "Jägerwegert" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you walk through the valley".
The soundcracker Salzstetten provided with his mixed choir and his female group - the "impulscher" - for the women's quota of the party.
The mixed choir carried out with the neopolitan peoples "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Anton Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulscher" also came back on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing section of the basinger Sportrein came with "What Is the Swob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papers "Bierlied" back into the domestic films where the Fullmaring Music Vereen is the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small extra program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsheimer led up a Casperltheater and read some stories that the children had worked well on the afternoon.

Kenyan press imports of controversial media legislation
“We are in a position to find ourselves in a difficult situation, and we can ask ourselves: What is it that Parliament is not going to create just the right independence tomorrow?” was read in a newspaper that does not agree with the draft legislation.
"The law is dramatic and very painful and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be taken forward because it is a longer government arm", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government adopted the new law "the media effectively in an attack". However, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had "a serious blow" and claimed the draft as "dragon".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which they were to see how the units sent to the tator were supposedly excommunicating the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the charge was withdrawn after a press release.
According to the new law, media houses may be imposed with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to punish the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a single punishment can already push most of the radio players into the bankrott."
In addition, the newspaper of the view that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya's description of "living blogosphere".
If they brought the media to the pool, politicians could do what they always want.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation that named the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians themselves take the country to the bankrock and we go back to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already taken public care of themselves in the past.
In May they agreed to reverse the cuts proposed by the National Compensation Commission and re-entered their permanent holdings of about 532,000 Schilling tax-free once a month – they are the highest in the world.
Bathroom: A dream will be true for the FC
In the interest of the city and the football club, the official entertainment festival for the artistic sport site was nothing despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant holiday hour may have wanted everyone on the last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
That's how all those people who came out without a rainscreen or could not keep one for some reason.
This went on to the musicians who covered the festival, just like some of the speakers.
So Nass was also the FC president Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were addressed by Mayor Walter Klumpp, who has made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the Community Council, the participating companies and members of the association.
Especially here are Lothar Held, Paul Weisenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty Rentners transferred 400 square metres of plastic stones for the new way.
This remarkable commitment would also be appreciated by the Land-based Director Karl Rombach.
Other major words were addressed to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the Southbad football band, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a contribution to the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that constantly changing weather conditions influence in the spring and autumn so that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem when it came to the construction of a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school at the salin lake.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts about the creation of an art sport site, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were included two years ago when the FC took over the lead in Erbpatt, committed a cost-sharing of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the site and paid the country a contribution of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 at the total cost of EUR 560,000, a fixed lump.
The construction of the 68 times 108 meters of large concrete site took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic metres of land were removed, half of which were used for the construction of a narrow bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal issues and justice.
This was done by the competent working group in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, decentralization and federal police.
On Monday, the Working Group also wanted to continue its consultations on migration and integration.
This should include dual-state citizenship, which has opposite views on both sides.
The SPD wants to end the pressure on children born in Germany to decide for a decision - the Union leaves a double pass.
On the subject of transport which is not on the agenda on this Friday, the SPD submitted her no to a Pkw-mut required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "flatrate for many journeys and therefore ecologically counterproductive," stated the SPD trade leader for the theme of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There have been trades on land roads that are already in crisis.
The introduction of a bridge for all Pkw would also be a first step from Pronolds' point of view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germany will be reduced to a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The Singing Führer on the Freebike
Stuttgart - "When's it's going to be real summer again?" wasn't actually the question on Friday evening at the Killesberg Freebunk.
It was really a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions are therefore for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Motorcycles severely injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old Pkw driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Musch was on the way to Grefrath with her car on the camper outside at 21.15 p.m.
If they wanted to leave to the left on St. Tóniser Street, they passed the cars they had arrived in the 37th year.
The bicycles collided.
The aacher suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Breaking after an accident on the centrifuge
The accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, at 20 o'clock, walked on the left track of the two-way railway town.
Shortly before crossing the border on the road, he noted that he was on the left side of the road towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right side of the road.
This led to a 23-year-old constant of BMW running there.
Also damaged was the 19-year-old VW pass behind the BMW.
In total, about 15000 damages occurred, the police shared.
The train had to be stopped during the accident, it continued.
Vienna airport for passenger calls from
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
For reasons like this, it will not be given at Vienna-Swechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the speakers' speech falls away - the laryngeal should be so clearly reduced.
The objective of this renewal is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As the airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Vienna, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of cross-border cases involving individuals.
So, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already on the learning calls.
Through the passage of these statements - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers - are due to be made more secure at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual cases have been taken relatively little, but at the same time also all other information on changed flights or departures is a bit below here," says Kleemann in his talk with the radio.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking train with tractors, there is another second battle at the agricultural harvest festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games will begin at 3.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have been raised in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual combatants are involved in the disciplines of tree trunks, hufeisen strains and water supply.
Four-and-a-half meters are long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't go far," explained organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe has to be removed from the ground, to fight once and then to get to bed.
This will be assessed with most points.
It comes to the target accuracy of the Hufeisen design.
Eight meters away will be fired on a pflock.
The ability and strength of the participants in the water supply must be evidenced over 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a bottle will be measured at the end.
Two of each "Clan" relational team can then participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 o'clock.
It is desirable to be appropriately dressed, for example, for example, the combatants can appear in the Stock Rock.
However, Swedish trade is also allowed.
For "Outfit" the jury will pay a few more bonus points.
You can log in by an hour before the start of the fight.
With the Scottish-Swedish HigHlander Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been taken on the site on Saturday.
In the evening, the musicians come at their cost.
At 19 o'clock, the biubomic glass music from Schömberg is designed on the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays great Polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes sensitive walzers and a sweet big band sound.
With this, the famous Heinz Koch will be known as the songr green and blackberry baron.
In Dornhan he is already present at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunt.
On Sunday, the musicverine will hold Leinstettes for breakfast, from 14 o'clock the farmer's hat is to guest, and the "Oldies" will then make the party sound.
The appointment is already on Friday with DJ Ralf.
Other programme points are on Saturday and Sunday, among other things, the meetings of the old-timers and trade unions, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and agriculture.
Further attractions on Sunday are the Maislavabyrinth, the handworker market and the sheepfold.
For children there is a stripeelzoo, striphüpfburg, tractors (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the promotional association of multi-stakeholder, ski club and the tractor friend "birth shop".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane food requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
For example, a sprayed tofu with plant smell is a quarker set.
The vegetarian association also called the World Vegant on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Bund Germany therefore proposes a number of vegan alternatives on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, Joghurt is replaced by Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, mandel or rice can be used.
Reluctant plant species replace normal bites.
There are also plant alternatives for eggs.
For example, a half-tongue banana can replace an egg as a binding agent in a kitchen.
Also 50 grams of apples or an apple made together plus three apples of water are suitable for this.
Locker is replaced by an egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon powder, a nutrient strength and three mineral water.
But also 50 grams Sojajoghurt or seidentofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently eating vegan in Germany, so clean plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald Gymnasium learned about the American capital, New York.
After eight hours of flight, the same thing happened to Brooklyn Bridge, through which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached.
There is already a fascinating view of the world-fascinating skyline, which makes a special trip in the evening light.
Through the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but with confidence the motto "The City does not sleep" was decided the day on Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the stand of freedom could be reached with a bike and set on foot.
Next came the financial center around the Wall Street to the memorial hall on 11 September.
On the third day, the students from the 373-metre high-level platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy it.
Then it went through the hetical drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which is an ideal opportunity for short distances in the autumn.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students arrived among their guest families and experienced the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marie, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the Hülsberg Street.
St. Hubertus was the case after a straight line of mindless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Lüttech.
The Jäddhornblaser group of the Jägdreiter Westfallen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is musicd on parforcehorns (natural horn in the Voice Es) after an old, original French melody.
The Blazers wear rowing because they prefer to accompany rowers, horses and dogs musically on skiing jackets.
The event will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed surface shines with a new coffee.
One that invites for forgiveness and return.
One that wants to make the name for the program.
According to Déjà Vu, Lexicon refers to a psychological phenomenon that appears in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation once.
In the case of the visit of the same-named Café to the Creis town of Kleve in view of the Rhein-Wal University, it must not remain in the pure Déjà Vu-sensitivity.
Finally, the Café with its beautiful name has that very objective: not only a real stay of thought, but always to make it possible again and again.
Because it's fun, and it's just nice.
A look into your life on page 8 gives the viewer a good sense of support.
The high-modern but not cool Café environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner welcome the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are tasteful kitchens or individually furnished fresh baguiettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before opening the beautiful Café on the offer as a gastronoms: they led the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg.
The sympathical Café lovers hope to be more public from turning to Klev.
Not at all by the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
More than that, the two young students here would like to speak exactly as adults and all age classes.
It's called Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathical owner pair is behind the coffee gene.
Enjoys the cool hot break in the different variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more than the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"That's my thing," she told the NRZ.
Two events are already in the bright Café.
Better say one thing.
Because the port party was already out there - the Café Dédha Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring ring ring ring.
"Good, successful and wise," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a voiced fan of events-nights: "You can't even do all right now."
And with an event I always talk only to those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be more than our exception.
"We want to disrupt the whole normal operation as little as possible."
To say: Déjà Vu is also for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment on the roof in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy.
For the joy of many Klevers, the guests from near and far and the students who also discover the gastromelies and thus the Café Dédha Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival that was invited by the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year, and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were pleased to come.
In the joint location of the guesthouse "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmony of each other in the character of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is also always the appropriate festival to celebrate.
About the special title "Singer of the Year" was this time writer Rolf Wagener.
"You not only wrote a lot for us but you've run so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said Chores President Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the events and chortry through activity flows went to the choir leader Dieter School with 44 participants this year, followed by the honour president Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place 5 impressed notewart Artur Brürner.
A special thanks went to the board of Weinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, which once more had a menu of the Extra Class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets its regular choral samples every day at 19.45 p.m. in the United States.
"New joyful voices are always welcome," said Schlotmann.
UN announced new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will begin immediately with the development of a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago for poverty control.
In the context of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began at night in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the move towards " Sustainable Development Goals" which would replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening at the summit, when it was time to “remember national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to take action to achieve a process of achieving universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate from the Member States in order to realize our vision of sustainable development goals building on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been in the game for four days without winning, it continues to be a good voice at the handball oberlists.
This is what Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope we will finally win again.
"For I don't even know how a victory tastes like this anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-party reserves from Fredenbeck have not yet removed any trees, Malmon has warned the display finger in front of the front.
I've trained many players myself in the A-young.
Therefore they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is therefore appropriate to wait for further strengthening from the first step," explains the SG-Coach.
Finally, to return to the success track, the Malmon team must grow in comparison with previous events in any case.
In the past, however, it was extremely difficult for all things to be covered in the coverage work and in the play.
The risk assessment must also be definitely improved.
So I hope that my players will finally be free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in view of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered at the center of Maputos under the growing eyes of the status quo of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to agree with a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the title "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the capital's independence on Thursday.
There have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been the worst fighting since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a popular rebel movement, which was supported by the white government of Rhodesia and later by the apartheid Government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became a opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an increased conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign and domestic investors.
For the fast growing economy, there is a lot to play because the discovery of huge gas reserves in the north-west could bring over 50 billion dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the following years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975, has been the dominant force, and Renamo has given each other the responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had held the latest meeting by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos on 17 October.
The remnants of the former rebels were scaled up as government troops attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlaka, the leader of the group, Renamos spoke against the Financial Times.
The government of Renamo owes the union and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
To AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlamaka considered himself “a loser” who wanted to use all his remaining forces to prove that he could force the government’s decisions.
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo has given up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
To the FT, he stated that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and how serious it is," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have only contributed little to the response to the tensions that have been threatened by a number of meetings this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who meet together the heads", says Joseph Hanlon, Dozent at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them is good at negotiating and nobody is willing to make the necessary adjustments.
Renamo, who is pressing for election reforms, has already explained that it will vote in November in favour of the municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to reduce movement, to bring about revenue and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success has deteriorated since 1992, while a new party, based on an earlier Renamo member of the Movimento Democratico de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve its election.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – its return will occur when its second official time is over in the next year – wants to destroy democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the President's office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has been busy attacking police stations and vehicles on important North-South connections.
Most of the property was located in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, where Beira is located, using the port, mountain construction firms such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the road.
Mazanga replied repeatedly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this cry.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going well," Mazanga said.
The instability has still increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already taken care of corruption, slow progress in development and a short-run trend.
"People think the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who will find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, said that people wanted only stability.
"No interest in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful streets," he said.
Children should be helped by Mythen and Legends as “improvers for Life”, meaning an author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the Artus legend shows how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the mythans are “to be too wild, too exciting and in some cases too dirty to be taught at school” why Crossley-Holland complained for an "careful selection" of old-law works.
"I think it's amazing that in America, mythen and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this for twenty years as a plan.
He added that among authors and teachers who would be “over-indictive” children would“ completely turn off” because in long-term stories the messages would be “inexhaustible”.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from English and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British People Tales, stated: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or brought to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be beautifully illustrated, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of the story.
Hansakob is still in Freehof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hanskob referred to his old-fashioned chair in Haslach, whose last years were spent in "Freihof" on Sunday.
The many spectators were fascinated by the very short stage game.
From the arrival of the grant of honor to his death, Drehbuuchautor and Hansjabmerseller Alois Kraftzzyk had designed a continuous piece of work under the reign of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as speakers through the ten different scenes, explained the context and extended periods from the youth to the next retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returned home to his family's home in his own home.
And then the stage began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his paradise role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht led Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the twin-pound and "Black-walksen" of Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received from the audience with a lot of applause, but his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to translate herself into the role of the sister and lost her life in Miami and Gestic.
Between the individual games scenes, the mühlenbacher Farmer hat played appropriately selected musical pieces and thus rendered the performance.
In order to give honor to the mayor, Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler gave honor, who, in the presence of the former officer Hättich, was waiting with a part of the city's treaty.
Your expectations were followed by the three-year-old singer, Hansjakob, who called out: "But it's nice that young memories of my own three-year-old will be alive again."
With her song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience at the leisure hall as well as the children of the day-to-day with their so-called "Heraus, Heaus".
At the time, his criticism at the church had made it clear exactly how he was concerned about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeyard, behind his graveyard on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his restroom.
"A restless spirit had finally found his peace and was always gone," he said at the end of the stage.
Many applause and many words of praise were given by the public for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Riesen
The opportunities for the remaining league of the sported Ludwigsburg Bundesliga-Basketballers have been increased.
Because if there's a wildcard procedure, then there's now less a competitor for the Neckar Riesen.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers delays an application for a possible landing site.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, the first rise was not to be taken from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't work with the Wildcard process, so long as it doesn't determine that Düsseldorf won't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, raiser Düsseldorf Baskets may add details to the judgment and demonstrate its economic dayliness.
Until then, the license was rejected twice.
The Court of Justice is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The Night's Church Returns to the Point of View
As the contribution of the city to the 150th-year existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourist office is the last of its annual public talks on Sunday, 27 October, the evening Mass Church.
After the visit of the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerlocher time was to be considered after 1850, when the Haigerloch came under Presbyterian rule.
Crünner’s final destination is a visit to the church at night.
There the leaders receive the story of the building of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic and Catholic way.
In the church there is also a look at the evening meal created by Friedrich Schzz with the support of Walter Kröll and George Halbritter.
It is an original reliable reproduction of the famous Milani model by Leonardo da Vinci.

Maps are available in the box of the Atomic Energy Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also be seen in Russia
The former U.S. Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. disaster.
Representatives of the federal government could either ask questions in writing or meet in Russia for 30 years personally.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency at the time of the call to non-arranged circles that were trusted with the position.
Such a question could be clarified in the international context, he said.
A visit to Sweden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany was a U.S. connector, dry snowden there the delivery, it continued
Longer breath makes itself paid
Six men fought at the Tennistor of the Society for the Winner Title.
At the end the team's duration decided the last match.
A dreamer had received the Tennis division of the sport friend Rohrdorf to the tournament of local associations and friends.

Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tour guide was in the hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Mathias Bronner were Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the victory, Carmen Müller finally managed to reach the wandererpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
The bronze peak reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
In late afternoons and coffee and kitchens, the successful appearance of the tournament took place.

In a New Zealand small town, Burt Muro is considered to be a precious cause because he has taken part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not going to get rid of his dream despite a heart failure.
With his savings, several expenses and a mortgage on his old workshop ships, he sails by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there are coffee, tea and kitchens.
Grills Pipes Destroy the People
Rheus Midgard has also invested heavily in the country.
They distribute the carbon coming from the ships to the harbor.
The company has several trains in the fire at the same location.
In addition to the carbon imports, Rhenus Midgard is based, among other things, on windscreen logistics.
Black shines the coal at the warehouse before the deich.
Split or load the coal here if necessary.
At any movement of the gears, there is a sharp warning noise across the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, executive director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
It is sad to hear of an impending wind - and there have already been some complaints of people from the north of the city.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In an agreement with the authorities, it is now possible to maintain the warning signals with technical measures.
He will also focus on the open dialogue with the neighbors in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else ahead of him.
With the development of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 metre leased in the terminal form, Capesize bullcarrier can be completed here as long as possible.
"In this year we want to cut the 3 million tonnes mark at the turn," said Schrell.
In addition to the eon power plant in front of the site, the import coal is used for power works in the country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes online, it will be well 5 million tons of coal imports per year.
The three shiploaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball despite first landing optimistic
Even the first download in Euroleague could not paint the huge optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball ballers.
"No one can forbid us to believe it, even against the best team of Europe of the past two years," balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday at the titled Olympic Péréus.
We have sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
At their first third appearance in the European King's class, the Munichers were sold very well for a long time, but they were not quite clear at the crucial stages.
The guests first created the art piece, turning a 15-point return 13 minutes before closing into a show, before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We have fought incredibly against the two Euroleague champion, but then made a slight mistake again," said Professor Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful publishers of the Munichers who celebrated in the first two parties against the Italian seriesmaster Montepaschi Siena and the Polish titler Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the varied artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the number of whites directly in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the year Fays innovation was built, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life, Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the state-up institution Carolinas, celebrates this year's 10-year anniversary with over sixteen shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners were at Carolinas and then were more and more successful until they were once known to meet in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this annual event there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy-beneficiary event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springstone, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of Commedians who took part in this year's festival have become known more unconventional ways, such as small television broadcasts such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-flying Fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and recreation" part of the crew, although she is the most famous for her video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and other young Comedies with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of the American Comedy.
The biggest visitors to the festival are an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but developed into a watched television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he updated a television series entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV land.
The meeting is held in the Town Hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself a week before the next meeting with the five UN powers and Germany to be satisfied with the negotiating process.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to address the differences in recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschwad Saif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a longer way, but the nuclear power trader would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of both sides there would be a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game camps with makeup
In Uruguay two children committed murder by an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12 - year - olds had invited their sacrifice to go with them to the birds ’ nest.
With Macheten and meskers armed, they created the 11th-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the lionnam into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Next, they had played before their apartments in a working quarter football.
The Leichnam was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach Punta del Este.
As alibi, a five-year-old half-brother of the disciples she had taken with her, she should have been sexually assaulted by the boys.
But when the girl described the attack without mention of an attack against her before the police, the two boys gave the alleged murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called, among other things, a rival in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth dance.
The defendant must be in prison
Because of excessive human trafficking, ageing, threats, abuse and dangerous bodily damage, the Land Court of Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years ago.
The former Federal Navy, who worked after two jobs in Afghanistan as a doorkeeper, gave a speech in a process language.
In five cases, therefore, he has informed women about Internet or telephone contacts that he sent to the strike after a few weeks against their will.
He tried to break up with violence and threats.
He maintained the women's incomes that he had made for him for part of the year.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards he connects women's contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who spoke to the women, he brought them to different boards in the south-west.
There he left them to monitor their revenues.
The defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan had come to him during an explosion about his life.
After a psychiatric expert had serious doubts about the psychological limitation and therefore a limited debt capacity, the 33-year-old left a comprehensive state of mind.
The Court did not have to take any more of the women who were injured.
As a Cripo official reported, following a first announcement, telephone surveillance could be detected by at least four other cases of outsourcing human trafficking.
The discussions that have been heard have been marked by high aggression.
In later acquisitions, the victims had confirmed their martyrium.
A further witness, one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not yet made a statement.
It is considered "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this mine as normal.
The complainant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He's got rid of these circles and wants to lead a whole normal life after the port," he said.
Oil price is up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also fallen on Friday, following concerns about a high supply of a report due to the growing energy production sector in China.
The reference fuel source for delivery in December was late morning in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange for 14 cents at 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cent on Thursday, which meant a price decrease of 5.8 per cent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has been taxing prices in the past weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy stated that last week the US offer was worth 4.1 million barrels.
Within five weeks the offer increased to 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was a greater demand for two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This is due to a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, which has increased by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the variety Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Judgment blocking decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frysk Directive
On Thursday, a federal court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had asked for changes to the Stop-and-Search programme of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The US Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Richterin Shira Scheindlin would be postponed until a city's appeal was decided.
In August the judge had condemned the city against the Constitution and how the programme for the ageing and asking of persons would be implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the proposed relief measures, including the decision, to establish a monitoring site to be supported by the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court heard the arguments for the ruling.
The Court of Justice stated that the Court had to be bound by the case because it had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of party participation; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which he had responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had sentenced police officers to damage the rights of tens of thousands of people because they were not properly directed to take black and Latin-American men with the stop-and-frysk programme.
It appointed an external post to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and organized a pilot programme with cameras carried out by the body in four quarters, in which most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was prepared to end the practice of saving names and addresses of persons who were remanded after a check by the police.
An oral trial for the city's occupation is planned after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frysk tactics were criticised by a number of citizens' rights defenders.
Controls of this type have been available in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the official period of the partial mayor Michael Bloomberg on an all-time scale of 684.330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Sponsors of amendments to the NYPD's stop-and-frysk programme say that the changes will end with unfair practices and create more reliable and effective police, as well as influence the way other police officers implement the regime.
On the contrary, the view is that the changes would affect the moral of the police, but not criminality; also would waste money and not solve the wider problem of a police police, which is following the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The Richterin pointed out that it does not end the stop-and-frysk practice which is constitutional, but only the way in which controls are implemented through the NYPD.
The happiness of the dreaming camel
Happy is an oasi that only dreamed camel reach
With this definition, the first president, Wolfgang Hene, described the history and fascinatingness of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday the 10th birthday of the Society was celebrated, which can already show significant success.
The first president told her about the work of the Association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation was developed, and Gynacologist Shenna conducted numerous operations on several trips.
During the talks, images of the use were shown on a large canvas wall so that the guests of the event could take a picture of the above actions.
The unit's desert vehicle was also shown.
It's a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, who was formerly an OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic installation and now plans to be active at the Union in advisory function.
In 2008, the room was built from Baiersbronn in the record time of nearly a week, the hospital station in Socogim, an Elendsviertel on the edge of the capital - honorary.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when birth clinics should be vegrated in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, so she, for example, resolve against burnout.
As a result of political unrest in the country, as many trips were planned, many doctors came to Germany to stay here in different areas.
In addition, regularly containers of material are sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medicines, binders, hospital beds and glasses are sent.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a rich local color by describing the experiences of the native musicians who traditionally supported the company during their Mauritanian journey from Mauritania to the mobile railway station.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of accounting as a young rapporteur.
When it became clear how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, it stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it wasn't far to Africa.
Coulson set phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson reportedly set up a “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip on an affair by the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
State attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special consultant" Hannah Pavlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pavlbys Voicemails and followed her, but Coulson also called on and left news as the court experienced.
“In the view of the state administration, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the needW, is no one who stands before people’s apartment and hopes to catch them on a fresh act, but one who wants people to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate history research: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The issuer is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
How does it look with the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking decision?
He argues about it, but we say, "Even if he knew it."
Reported about an affair Clarkes was first caught by the feature editor of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Paulby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from its phone of at least three reasons was secured in the apartment in Mulcaires in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, Paulby and their sister were stored as “projects”.
In the time when the research took place, the parents of Paulby received anonymous calls, where they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Under it, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pavlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following contents: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I want to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities at this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The complainants heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was dealing with the mythical Rebekah Brooks who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have other concerns to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
In fact, the French football will be the first strike since 1972.
A lightning strike is in vain.
In the conflict with the rain tax, the government and the professional football in France have managed after a separate crackdown in a sack gas.
President François Hollande received comments on Thursday at the Paris Élysée-Palasta Association and Association Representatives and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to pay the football from the planned 75-percent amount of income of more than one million euros per year that all companies in the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite is also true.
The strike announced for the end of November will also take place, with Jean-Pierre Louvel, the Chief Association of the Prof.
The playdays set between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 therefore fall.
Swimming: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the population early in the planning," opened Mayor Jens Häusler's information event for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the Community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, to express their concerns and to introduce ideas.
Mr Hüßler made it clear that "the final decisions are made by the members of the Council".
The high water, which occurred on 15 May 2009, unprepared, was an event that raised the issue for future protection measures, such as households.
A river area survey was commissioned by the neighboring village of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many building blocks as possible is the goal," said the owner.
It is based on the planning of protection for a German weather service that is statistically expected for every 100 years.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent supplement.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that have caused significant damage in geching in 2009 resulted in a 1000-year high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved," said the owner.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen, where the communities can count on land grants of about 70 per cent.
However, the Houses showed that there is only support if a whole concept is implemented.
The Community should therefore refer to the involvement of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can be started with implementation.
Among other things, the concept of protection which has already been presented in the Community Council last week (we have reported) local measures in the flow of the river Irm from the domestic valley.
In connection with the presentation of the high water protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to introduce their applications.
Among other things, it was asked why dams and reservoirs were no longer planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, a specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the combination of all proposed measures is necessary to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, if you were supposed to find the most economic solution, Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
In contrast, he ruled in the area of the Altor, who had to suffer again and again under a overload of the channel network.
The problem is known to the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, households have shown that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for high water protection and should not be missed.
The Community was obliged to set up the channel network so that two-to-three-year regenerative events could be strengthened.
The water canals to scale larger, would vary millions.
Injured after total
On the morning of Friday morning, two car drivers were severely injured on the road near Ravensdorf.
The police stopped the street immediately, but they could say very little about the accident.
However, there are various evidence cases that should be assessed first.
It is noted that the 19-year-old linkerin of a VW Golf in the direction of Ravensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came out with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles rolled together, where the woman was so badly dressed that the fire weapon needed almost half an hour to get them out of the car trunk.
The actual cause of accidents was first unclear.
Both disabled came into close hospitals.
The track was closed about two hours later.
You could call him Dostojewski from the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Godtsucher, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Exhausting the connection in the outside: the rising eyes, the bar, the high stars.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is understood by his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologetic of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is considered an American prophet who has something to do with his own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is distributed twice.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, accompanied by paranoia, security guard and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read as a blend from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He's got it, early in the morning, that the computers are divine.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A great writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is especially significant now.
The "Minimumity Report" comes from 1956, which undermines the reputation of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "Pre-Crime", so what is between more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is the same as our alarming, we look at mutants in the future - and the police.
"We see individuals who have not understood any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll cut them off before they can commit a crime of violence."
And "In our society there are no serious offenders, for that we have a punishment full of pesuddo offenders."
They believe that harm is happening, and they prevent the criminal thought from being applied in fact.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror gesture and the withdrawal of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: So does Obama Drohnen-Philosophy and Praxis.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police regrets that there is no division of violence anymore, the military controls the daily and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is running.
It's perfect, but it's false.
It will meet its own requirements.
It takes iron and sacrifice not only in purchases but also builds on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Philip K. Dick reads, always comes closer to the truth.
Spacious fairs about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Government could either ask questions in writing or meet in Russia in their 30s personally, the Interfax Agency reported.
In the past, the Green-Bunde-Funday's editor Hans-Christian Ströbele had met last night as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the business.
Strengthen corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a quiet day at the end of August, a German police officer flew over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Finance Germany.
On instructions from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should take photos of the roof of the U.S. external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of speech between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again stated in September that the United States would not use the possibility of foreign spying "to steal the secrets of foreign companies in order to build their international competitiveness or their gains."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become the Whistleblower's sole employee, has begun publishing his full-time report to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the Director in word.
Reports show that because the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company paranoia has brought about a new state-of-the-art surveillance.
The passing phase brought the impression that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was overdue, perhaps ten years ago.
If the most powerful person in Europe can reach the visitor, there are also potential targets for companies with certainty.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I believe it is possible to use this data for mutual use.
"Germany has to wake up," explains Oliver Green, president of the BITMI, the small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now poses an almost as high risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data waste, a survey published by the EY consultancy firm in July.
However, in the documents provided by Snowden, there was no provision so far that the United States had passed on the secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
On the German day we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you wouldn't have to let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised from coal over cars to agriculture.
It's all up to the IT sector.
Nevertheless, wealth and technical refinements have shocked US spying authorities who had previously seen the largest spying risk in China.
Cloud Computing will make a big change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the US are subject to that legal issue and are potentially at risk.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the disclosure of US data mining activities with prism, about 10 per cent of U.S. members are planning to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP's deputy business manager, says: “We see a new question from customers who didn't have it a year ago – they say: Where are my data stored and you can guarantee that this remains physically in this legal room?”
Many German business leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already know, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore be kept at every price.
What's happening is not surprising.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of BASF.
The Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The company's management usually does not rely on the measures taken, because it brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies employees have long shown that the company of a free USB stick on a show or the unsupervised lease of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of automobile manufacturer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect phones before a board meeting so that they can't be used as earphones.
The German BVT generates driving forces to easily use prepaid handys when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys will be fired later.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany many of these companies are world market leaders in their markets.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access”, warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warns its own companies before economic spying through other countries.
According to Washington Post, U.S. National Intelligence Estimates were organized in February France, Russia and Israel behind China into two of the countries that served to acquire economic data from the hacking.
A member of a German Blue chip company agreed that if it was about economic spying, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Interior Service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: "The Secret Services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, will excommunicate their allies."
Hechingen: Messe gives an answer to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery journey that can be undertaken by man," said philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding celebration was celebrated, now there was a special event in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding season.
A trend: The retro-look has been resuscitated.
This starts with the wedding dressers.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
In the past, the many painted and decorated clothes are closed with stickers, often with a blade, but they go back and end up in a hole.
However, the spirits differ as Stephanie Koch points out from the fashion house of the dress miller.
The approach is dominated by West and Plastron, but it can also be selected with cream-coloured or brown combinations.
It's important to choose the location. It's explained.
Beautiful extra rooms are not ideal, the environment should be especially.
Here the domains focused on their own offer in the remission.
Anyone who wants to proceed with the kitchen has an offer for Uwe Link.
"Kutschen is also popular for young people," he says.
Romantic is also required for introduction cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding photos.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wadding-Photo" - so recordings of special locations, mainly some water cases, some days after the party, but in wedding dress, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, ring, wedding table, kitchen and also a vacuum cleaner, such as Marko Ripper, who can keep the guests quiet.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and needle care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.

The parents of a youth from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a joint ring office in the tournament of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a straight-up matte behind the tribune in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lownde County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, which challenged the family of the 17-year-olds.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They had never believed he had died as the sheriff concluded.
"They are the view that every logic is understood against the laws of physics as well as against the health of human beings," Crup said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be betrayed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back to the gym," he commented.
U.S. state attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, since a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death to return to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts that guide them in the same direction.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy pointed out that Johnson was dead as a result of a “post condition” strike.
A second autopsy, however, has resulted in another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be charged with carrying out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that were checked by the investigators.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC public education Allergy Directives
On Wednesday, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, as the number of schoolchildren increases with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information on schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that Epinephrin schools are ready – the self-injection of the EpiPen brand is most often used – to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the United States have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin simple.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who show an allergic reaction.
The children may say, "It feels like something pushes on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair on it" or "My tongue cracks".
Parents of intersex children can choose "Sexually Indeterminate"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognised for children born with non-explained genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned to men or women.
The new law no longer requires parents to explain sex to such children, but it is possible to state "undefined" or "not established" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to make the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make comprehensive decisions in relation to operations for sexual orientation in newborns and to combat discrimination against persons of intersex.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm still tired and full of nerves, the flicker made by doctors.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children each year will not become a young person or a girl in the world.
They are part of the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a set of concepts for people with atypical chromosomes, chromosomal stems (eile stems or hodens) or unusual genetics.
Wallis Simpson may have been sexually active.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend that the best available information be used for sex identification if it is not possible to determine, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development, before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized on the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "well after a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Many people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical intervention, but for most children this does not apply”, he said.
You can take a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret because people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011, it is important to distinguish between people who are sexually active or transgender, because their status is not sexual, but because of their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were manifested in complex sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, eating, breast and stomach, pre-existing sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination against persons exposed to intersex and transgender life and of the extent of torture, violence and prejudice.
Not with the gender picture, boys now have a special camp.
Between Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to refer to official documents either male, female or "third-generation".
In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “without sex” person in the world after a court had granted the long maintenance of a “undefined” sex status.
In addition to M and W German publications, the Ministry of the Interior has a third assignment, X for intersexual purposes.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, thousands of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from schools.
The U.S. Catholic Online website also spoke against the German law, reasoning: "If the world is thrown into a new state where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we will have two further pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland said against baby zone, it would be better if babies were given sex at birth.
"The parentage is also stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child," she said on the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born to both men and women were named Hermaphrodite after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, the medicine considered the sex as something you can erase and then rebuild.
However, there are doubts about the ethical grounds for an operation after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when he or she grows up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatry disaster’,” said Drescher.
If such a child was born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from the John's Hopkins University, who believes that sex is formal.
He discussed the concept of “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental concerns – such as parenting – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and wondered whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" since 1966, his theories were controversial.
He laughs at the parents of a boy whose penis was cut off at a fractured wound to throw the child away completely and also remove his hips and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a change which he was not,” Drescher said.
When he was about 15 years old, he changed into a man and married a woman.
I'm 38 years old, but it's suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have joined the public, who are “not happy with the result”.
This is what happened to Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY human chromosomes, but second-hand Genitals.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the hoden were removed soon after the birth of 1976 surgically and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said against ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew he didn't agree, he wanted his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one has ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that did not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitalia.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections and was able to remove his breasts.
The operation has made him unproductive.
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersexual people seem normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Lawyers for Reported Choice in California, ensures that the German law can "encourage for embezzlement and stigmatization".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and not to "give the child a ‘undefined’,” she said.
We are afraid that this will benefit intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not yet know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to recognize as a third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law refers to the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
If they are adults, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual difference and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law is “authorized” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor deficiency of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have a tumor and no eggs.
Today Katie is married to 29 and is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although it is unproductive, however, it hopes that a child can be obtained by adoption or by a lay mother.
"The law provides a room for parents to make decisions that they do not have to make," Baratz said.
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time to write them “human” or “female”.
In this way everything is fine – you bring the child big and you love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to take over an operation that won't get back.
“This concludes the children’s decision with one and eliminates the fear of the parents because they think they would not do the right thing,” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that best suits him – and that's wonderful.
By doing so, children will be able to make their own decision.
Unknown injuries to girls by shooting out of the car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Ahalt when shooting from a car.
On Thursday evening in Genthin, the aunts probably burned an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That's what the police in Burg shared.
The girl was slightly injured on the left side of Wade.
The girl was taken to the hospital by rescue forces.
The shot came from a small car that had been passed on to a group of six children and had been arrested immediately.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The tattoos also hang on a bus stop.
A disc has been blown.
Then they heard of it.
The criminal police identified it on Friday.
Until now, police inspection teams can look back at a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to recruit children who were fighting against domestic violence.
Since household owners recognized this at the right time and even removed the rest of the eggs, there must be no damage.
In addition, some Sylvesterbullers were also cured in the city area, but there has also been no damage here.
A resident of the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his Pkw was developed with paper and his radar tapes were used.
Until the police arrived, however, the man discovered his radarlights in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with many greens, an old building, nice neighborhoods and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transport.
"They don't have any fear of spins?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed at a fat spin on the door.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spinal cord, but the concern, in old age, is that many steps can no longer be handled at home and in the apartment.
In addition, since a Menishkus operation, the midwife has had to experience in her own body what it means to move with Handicap from Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Recently, a book from her appeared on the subject 'Happy to live in age - What kind of apartment is best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on in old age' she begins to tell.
When she went to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all confused with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most of them lose it as long as it goes.
It's always just the other people's age, they say pretty.
Only if the pressure of suffering is really great can you imagine.
'But it can be too late,' said Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a particular apartment in the old age.
'What kind of apartment you choose, however, is always an individual decision,' she explains.
D i e solution is not given for age.
Even those who are able to care for the old age in Tuscany or Britain should always assume that he can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, one can also be united in the Dolce Vita,' says the specialist book author Ausidlung.
Among its models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted Rentner-WG.
In old age, everyone has his tickets and makeup.
'There would be no such community for me,' she said with a tears in her eyes.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age you just need your back rooms', says Ries.
However, that an adult housing community can work, the bookstore does not want to be excluded.
But that must be different from the classic students' WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace, she thinks.
In this opinion, at least she is not alone in the capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they want,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the director of the civil service living in the old town of the capital.
Your service tells people about the topic 'to become older'.
That is why even older people would often get into trouble and restrictions in order to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Watchet Foundation.
Today there are many opportunities to rent the house or apartment freely.
Ries recommends that all who work with the old-law building of their home or apartment should inform themselves thoroughly only once and not contact the first-hand workers.
Today there is also the age-righted reconstruction of specialists.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can realize it, and if it is only the height of the toilet, the interior architecture is clear.
But the existing apartment does not always have the right to age and thus to be restructured freely even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud laughs.
Although within the apartment you could install a stairs lift which would also be a much larger obstacle to the living room with stairs.
She will search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the turn, she digs more than before the spin at her apartment door.
The United States wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude toward former U.S. Secretary of State Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be denied access to confidential information.
That is why he had to take a punishment procedure in the United States, said U.S. Foreign Minister Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Nor would the recent developments of Snowden change anything.
The German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was in strict warnings about the behaviour of a parliamentarian and not about a German member of the government.
Secret Service Hall Edward Snowden is basically ready for a meeting with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know what his situation is.
This was made clear by former US NSA staff in a non-addressed letter published by green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and led to the Federal Government, Federal and General Bundesanwalt.
The text reads as follows after a translation by Ströbel:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your examination for mass monitoring.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
As regards my employment in these institutions, I have been a witness to the systematic violation of my government's law, which has forced me from a moral obligation to trade.
As a result of the publication of these thoughts, I saw myself being exposed to a heavy and persistent fever that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am now living in exile and enjoying a renewed asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have considered the assumptions to be a system of comprehensive monitoring that no one is responsible for when assessing a service to the public.
These speculations led many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the widespread misuse of public confidence.
The benefits for the company from these gains are increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks of purchases have been considerably reduced.
Although the results of my efforts were certainly positive, my Government still treats these as a breach of trust and then seeks to criminalize political opinion and to make accusations.
Yet speaking the truth is no sin.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will adopt this stance.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are encountered, I will be able to take part in the responsible statement of the case concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I am pleased to have a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to ensure that international law protects us all.
Edward Snowden by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Child gardens have found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterling's.
The former children's gardens in the garden street have sold the municipality to a private person.
The Council approved the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owners to a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Mayer.
The budget was EUR 100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former children's gardens.
The Mayor is entitled to give winterlings the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to come up for the maintenance of the house, like heating to look after the garden and take care of the wall.
"This resurrection is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high-level temperatures
The musician Hammereisenbach has a concert on the terrace of the guesthouse Hammer.
When Dirigentin Bianca Willmann has the Taktstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 audiences enjoy the sounds of Hammeric musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, will explain the music.
In this framework, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to manage the first music hock successfully.
Report: Obama campaign dedicated to replacing requests by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's most close advisers have spoken in secret to Vice President Joe Biden to replace Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, so New York Times.
The enthusiast is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long- awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, “Dubble Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times presents a copy of the first book that appeared on Thursday, and they reported that the president's top consultants had conducted "foreign group meetings and interviews at the end of 2011" to find out whether there was a better hope for Obama to look forward to re-election if he was to be asked.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book basically draws on the history of the efforts of leading members of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the question of sharing with former Foreign Minister Clinton against Vice Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only half a thousand of the president's most recent councillors, including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former head of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, were aware of the proposed change.
In “Duble Down” it is claimed that Daley had stood at the top of his efforts to exchange her “non, personal relationship” before it was finally decided against such a shock after the data showed that Clinton's candidate would “not significantly improve the chances of Obamas”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government has actually been able to substitute requests by Clinton.
"I went out of a series of things you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President was once fearfully frustrated, so we thought: “To God’s will, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the studies as “prescribed care”, Martin told CNN against Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, there was a significant change in whether such training was paid for the election.
"In campaigns, little money will be spent on questions and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said against CNN, he asked Dale whether his former boss knew about the potential change decision.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff said that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Dubble Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama had no idea of the investigation whether you should let a request fall in the election.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
What's going on along my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service e-mail, will the mail secret be technically applied?
In the design of early Internet services, communication was essential.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been considered to create a stable basis for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a normal e-mail is more like an open mailbox than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser will first send the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
If she has a GMail account, for example, she would be Google.
This mail server will send the content to the provider using Benni.
On the way, the mail can run over some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will ordinary e-mails be shared on their way through the network?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots.
In the case of the supplier of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail is carrying out a damage program as an attachment.
A virus check will also be carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is about an empty and unwanted spam mail that is equally deleted or is removed into a spam folder at least.
Do the robots have another job?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trips, Google can include appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do you also read e-mails to unknown people?
The likelihood of unauthorised people reading a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to receive e-mails or to take notice of them.
This will result in possible illegal evictions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical coverage it is also possible to disseminate the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that one cannot even be identified without any further identification of who has communicated with it.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a sub-ordered role for a study of Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo mail were last dropped, GMail was able to clearly submit to Google.
Mother goes into the forest and rents
When his pregnant mother died, a man from Wolfsburg cursed a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and still cast their pensions and pensions.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
First, he lost the death of 89 years of age, then he spent more than half a year on money.
Now the 67-year-old must answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it seemed that no medication was needed for the nursing mother.
The investigator told the Rentner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials were making this remarkable progress, they continued to identify it.
It became clear that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had recently provided it.
The 67-year-old has finally caused the death of his mother.
According to the police, an objection was not made to a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first light ice in the dark – with the help of qualls.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the seabed and created a light lake.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on sources and convinced Chinese scientists to produce the light protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts to consumption with the tongue by raising the pH value in the protein and releasing the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you laugh, the better it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH value increases and the ice shines.
We've tested it in the last few months and it seems ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the source light is four times more expensive than gold.
Every dog costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes nice for that.
Charlie's experimental company with seating in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, which include beer, cheese, beef and paper gold.
But his new creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the lack of light caused by ice crystals, from which ice cream exists; but I am afraid we will find an opportunity to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a source produced artificially by Chinese scientists
The TVV Morsum is still six days after the game, without any point in the handball league.
Calculate now comes for Ingo Ehler's team tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden who celebrated his first victory last week.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehler's attitude is optimistic.
Finally, he has his complete framework, with the exception of the permanent wounded Hendrik Bloom.
Daverden also puts it like we're on a game of time.
That is why we need to keep our deficits low.
In the first line, however, it is appropriate to increase in coverage, which has left everything else behind than a safe impression.
Deverden's Coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a home number.
But that's why we haven't been in favor for a long time, because in Derby it can always happen.
At the same time, Panitz wants to stay in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Joad.
To this end, the A-young Joost Windhouse, which is active with double-playing rights at the A-young Bundeslist HC Bremen, celebrates its season off.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sisters and I were able to eat, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become the Halloween Muffel.
In the last two years, I have not been able to explain to myself how to share my apartment from sights, and it will probably not be done this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black creature that touches Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exactly – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, so the US-American trade union (NRF).
One thing I'm happy about every Halloween then again is the trend.
The cost will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
In this year there are rising lifeless objects of the last step.
Women don't have to hang out in sexy clothes anymore, they can also now eat nutritious food like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect every number of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I know that daft-punk-world men will create it this year into the Instagram feed.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and Hexen.
I'm guessing it's nothing familiar with tradition.
Last year we wore our dogs and were not alone in my recovery.
In fact, US$330 million this year for the costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as we're concerned, we're not clumsy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on it, says The Nielsen Company.
These are some 270 million kilograms of chocolate, lottery, bonus and rubber bars.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who go through the quarter with the talk "Süßes or Saures".
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't want anything – to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugarcandy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, so the National Association of Sugar Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion masculins.
It's a rat I couldn't solve yet.
There's nothing more about Halloween than a house in which it explodes.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized shelters in the United States that generate 500 million dollars of relief, so America hairs, and this concludes the wonderful photos that you just point into the house and then put your friends on Facebook where you don't lose them again, and then one of the type on which you are leaving a comment like "low facial expression".
But we're finally going to the cubs.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the Great Circus when we were children, and the cut of a circulator is like the beauty of the Christmas tree – something we've done since childhood.
Fortunately, the "Baby in the Kürbis" trend started last year thanks Pinterest, so that most of us grew up to fix the Kürbis and not sit there.
This year some 106 million dollars will be spent on bugs, says the US Census Bureau.
The Kurbillates, which slowly rotted in the front yard, are probably from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of Kurbisse have been cut off.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathhisdon in Napa, California and cut something beautiful out of their 921 kilos of hard beer.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains frozen bodies
The fire weapon had to be released on the late Thursday evening in Helmbachts.
A three-family house in the rural circle of the Court begins in the night of Friday fire.
The rescue forces are carrying a frozen body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a frozen body in a three-family home at a fire in Helmbrüchts.
Whether it's about a resident is still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
It was burned on the ground floor of the house late Thursday night.
When the firefire broke out, the flames were already blown out of a window.
The use forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole earth was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spoke further.
The building was no longer possible.
The exact cause for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive campaign to acquire the pastor's profession.
The evangelical Lutheran Church Hanover calculates that the number of its current number of pastors and pastors will be half by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, says Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in his discussion with the evangelical press service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day work itself.
With Burfien, the country church first commissioned a pastor on a full-time basis to attract young people to the Theology.
At present, less and less young people choose to study theology.
Burfien brings this back to the process of decommissioning: "Good voice is slow, the world is loud".
The profession has been characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my term calendar, and I can focus on where it matters to me.
Priests could be very close to people as soul-suppliers.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Of course, more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have been a safe employer for that.
This is the case with young people today who are not only about careers but about a meaningful work.
According to the National Church, which comprises three quarters of the Netherlands, about 60 pastors go to peace every year.
At the same time, some 40 graduates of a theology study began their vicariat.
In densely populated coastal areas such as Harz, Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult in the future to acquire places.
Burfien wants to organize, among other things, a study day for young people and invite prominent ones who have studied theology.
The Theology Studio offers a wide range of training.
You can even be President of the Federation.
Country Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are rent seats and six-point courts as well as a free speech facility.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the management of Bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle installation between events.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally Customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventures as well as a way to get to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will create new opportunities to experience different Rally disciplines in the United Kingdom and abroad and to prepare Newlings on the steps and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge Wages – this will be a continuous masterpiece.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to take part in the West Bank in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire extinguishers call for the rescue of a knife, which is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous spring in a stone bridge
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a space passenger in the rock bridge in her misse position.
Firemen sat down on the wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire weapon was able to bring a knife to safety, which was set at a height of 15 meters.
The nine months old cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running alone after a traffic accident on Wednesday and survived alone three days before being rescued from a stone bridge on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belong to the dog, came to the stone bridge Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank for the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been confused about their missing dog and had published helpouts in social networks after the small traffic accident in the stone bridge.
About 14:15 a.m., a walker saw a walker who drove his dog out, the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high in the stone bridge.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station took place and landed for the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported to a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It is located in the middle of the cliff wall – 15 meters from above and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was as frozen.
But now she's doing fine.
She then freshened up a few dogs.
That was a very unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a lot of luck."
It was the possibility that she was severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary medicinal product for testing, but nothing was established except creation and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was overwhelming to see salvation."
I couldn't even believe she was up there.
It was great to keep her in the arms again.
The zoologist stated that if the creation had become too large and they had been broken up, it would probably have been interrupted.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never noticed Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio player this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer at Jaggers Song "Old Habits The Hard" since 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altroker at night and that "he'd raised me when I was 18. "
She added: "That's a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorizedly denied that he had ever taken an approach test at Katy Perry”.
The representative added: "Maybe she'd replaced him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.

George Kerevan: European escape gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new step history of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the touchword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with Stacheldraht along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this would not play a role – as expected – in the battle lines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States often adhere to their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would only be a small obstacle to what one really wants from the camps.
So, actually, no story.
And one who has come so far in years that it is already equal to a fossil: The first time I've heard the "Independence means passive control" end at least 40 years ago.
This is an interesting point in the ongoing repetition of this ancient story.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European flag?
Why did the London Joch exchange against that from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great, post-war plan for Europe's integration has been put into stock.
The euro crisis has officially killed the European project.
In the EU, parties who have won land which are EU-enemies or want to cast the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Party was able to raise almost five million votes at the Federal Day elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict saving policy attached to Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the pressure jackage in which the national economy is used by the holding of the common currency, many people have the view that Europe's project has been too far away.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budgetary deficits – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members on exchange rates which are benefiting German exporters – and this is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of an evaluation of local currency, South Europe will again find itself with a built-in productivity share against Germany.
The only option is to reduce wages and public expenditure – from Berlin.
Behind the current state and monetary problems is a deeper issue of European productivity.
As a result of the "green" energy policies organised by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry is paying double for electricity and the fourth phase for gas with the United States.
This is a relaxing part of the cost, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect all the world's payrolls from being forced into the corner by cheap American skiing gas.
As a result, there is a revolution, especially in France, the only EU leader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle holding Germany in chess and being able to hold Paris at the top of Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a tower for political legitimacy and Europe has stressed its own economic policy to fight against the French economy in question.
The result: Marine Le Pens Justice, EU hostile Front National has just won a decisive election and thus refer the ruling Socialists to three places.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voter's votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can't go out of it would mean a column in the right corner automatically benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her new popularity under the white francs of the working class?
She would like to use the EU elections next year to ridicule an anti-EU anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and this is very possible – then the European Parliament could first dominate such a block.
This is the point I want to put forward: in the near future, the growing responsibilities against the EU and the common currency will be put together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the "Europe of the (survival) Nations", which General de Gaulle has favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold firm on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is closer to the fact that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic.
Where's Scotland staying with everyone?
We can decide to be a region of (last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is also part of Berlin and Brussels, what they can do wherever they can.
I am convinced that Scotland would be able to move well in a closer European Union if we kept our own money.
Cooperation with other countries similar to those of other countries is easier in a non-favoured Europe of the nations.
In other words, we should consider keeping it equal to Norway and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, of course, the most successful political movement against saving policy in Europe and has won a more spectacular majority in 2011 due to the decline in the proposed (and planned) cuts that Labour Minister Alistair Darling and the next Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to respond to.
It would be a shame for Scotland to decide now for independence only to get encouragement from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Faster growth
Afro-American and Spanish girls tend to achieve puberty more than their white age genes, as studies show.
Physical changes do not necessarily mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemiological obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter has grown up in age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and presented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time trying to calm down parents – usually it’s not a sign that puberty is coming in soon,” Kaplowitz explained.
Public displays of development, such as growing breasts, scars and axelhairs, as well as body smells, appear earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight variation in the age of the Menarche (representatives of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also the author of the book "Early Pubertätt in Girls: The essential consultant to deal with this problem frequently".
Time is the exact test, as the puberty progresses.
It is disputed what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "frequency" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth vessel eight years ago.
In most cases the process slows down or slows down – something that a doctor can monitor exactly.
In the case of faster progress tests, an endicronologist could be shown to exclude serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and reverse another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can lead to optimal growth and thus lead to small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicationless or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the development rate, the growth rate and the emotional range.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz has repeatedly been involved with drugs, but he adds: “The pressure of puberty can cause behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be mild, other than their aging parents.”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young girls to have the period.
"They care about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter received her ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She became pregnant and was expelled from school to home because she was the first in her group of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no definitive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would cause harm.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Capliwitz is the view that the most convincing premium is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which produced a relationship between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country African and Spanish girls tend to achieve puberty more than their white age.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty of all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate to genes.
Another line: Although boys are already growing face and face care before, the trend towards a full-fledged former puberty is not as extreme as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the subject.
The rise of Akne and Schamhaar is widespread even in babies and young children.
"We must be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to allow their child’s doctor to advise them how they should talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kapplowitz says.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who thrive early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute large orders about seat width
Among leading air carriers, there has been an exchange of views on the range of seats in the tourist class at long-range flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter summary on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The conflict is about the range of seats that passengers are offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those who try to make themselves most of the airlines, but this designated space represents the key to efficiency considerations in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
This week Airbus asked for a industry standard, which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 customs) in the tourist class, but the US-Ezrival Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
The replacement takes place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are obliged to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range flight crews and are expected to hold records from 17 to 21 November.
As the latter part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are lines with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to deliver the new “mini-jumbo” design.
Boeing argues that its modernized "777X" phase 406 people sit in the tourist class who are over 17 customs and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 customs seats in the tourist class, where there are nine per row.
Aircraft operators often share love about technical details through advertising in the press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders are expected to run directly to the public.
Recently, the company introduced an announcement that could start a new display war and showed money providers a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant and the title “Would you like to accept it?”
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are less likely to be regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In view of changed eating habits, people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the average American has increased by 10 per cent between 40 and 49 years, according to data from the U.S. Ministry of Health.
The number of male average Americans in the 21st century is according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival stood on a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly coated Jet Set was smaller.
So Airbus conducted studies that suggested an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contends with the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says it is not possible to determine how airlines designed the balance between flight rates and the establishment.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in aircraft is dependent on more than the size of the seat.
“It’s really going beyond giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful,” explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what they do profitably.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers there is more freedom of movement, but for manufacturers there will be an increasing number of issues that can affect the implementation.
A range of air traffic orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at listed prices in the coming decades could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat is the driving force behind the construction of the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-engine long-track signs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boings statement depends partly on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still smaller than the machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore waiting for more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers had decided for the lower order what could be done with cheaper flight rates.
"Ten customs would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin establishment, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-facing Jet sellers even brought band sizes to measure the institution’s competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-quality design for ticket flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with tens of lines, but according to its own statement, it hasn't sold anyone yet.
Until recently Airbus stressed the importance of the more adaptability of the cabins and offered a wide range of seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call could probably be cleared after a new industry standard, but could be derived from the well of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the garage enjoyable when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could ruin the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect Mouse from nicotine poisoning for a long time.
Before human tests, further trials are needed, which can last for several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but they had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a non-harmonised virus that has been changed to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
Antibodys hunt for nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralise them before they reach their brain, which does not make nicotine high.
In trials, infected mice that were administered nicotine were considered to be at normal level of activity.
Mouses without improvising, however, had taken a “outtime”, the researchers declared a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the section page Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco substances fail because they contain antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often in order to maintain the anticoagulation seal that they were expensive and ineffective.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could be used if it is completely safe to use children before trying to try to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop it.
“They know that if they start smoking again, they don’t feel satisfied because of the nicotine vaccine, and it helps them to break the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi strives to be influenced by both
In contrast to former Labour Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisory Authority.
The former NSW Minister seeks to change the maritime agreement arrangements on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who has hidden participations in three main parts of the state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has expanded its investigations on Friday whether both ministers of different states have been affected by the impact of these agreements at the Circular Quay, where both restaurants and a café operate without having to be extended after their departure in August 2005.
Now due to the charge, trypodi has been aware of the interest hidden by both sides in the basics after Tripodis, former founder chief Lynne Ashpole on Thursday, spoke accordingly.
In the 2005 annual talks, the Government had insisted on public statements for the Treaty contracts.
The pilgrims were against it and wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, the contract contracts for the companies at the Circuit Quay, which were awarded each year for $2.5 million, were extended without public disclosure.
Tripodi, who served as the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public statements.
However, he argued that the amendments had been made to the requests of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced a revision of the government's passports.
One of the ICAC's phone records showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who had been transferred to the Ministry of Ports after working under UFO.
"Where is the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial contractual arrangements?" asked Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
"No," you answer Tripod.
I can't remember what was promised, but it was definitely not.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli combat aircraft reached their target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had reached a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, confirming a leading government worker against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press it was about Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air raids on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas may be subjected to "true test"
In the context of further measures, the Government is considering a ‘realistic test’ for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it should be based on a criterion which should prevent the 457 use of unqualified jobs or as a background for the arrival of family and friends to Australia.
Today a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the Labour Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the Government's comments to foreign workers because they could be regarded as an insult to Australian neighbours.
“Soundly statements such as ‘foreigners are supposed to stand back’ and ‘Australian’ are a very unpleasant return in times when cooperatives have asked for a protected labour market,” she told the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, it was considered that white labour forces should be protected – and if some in the region took an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The debate proposal concerns twelve measures that were first taken by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigrants Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was late last night to talk about human malaise in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the proposed amendments that are still being considered.
If the ‘reality criterion’ is adopted, a person requesting a visa may be able to verify in detail whether ‘the application is true in cases in which the applicant is connected with the holder or a relevant person of the subsidiary’.
In addition, companies could be obliged to take account of the number of 457 visa holders following the introduction of hundreds of companies which initially wanted to support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylant died probably on a heart attack after he arrived this week with a flightboat on the Christmas cell.
The lost nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Barones Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown stated that he was very happy to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, links will be made to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further road capacity and travel improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baronness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national street network, which brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We go forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits to ourselves.
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
However, it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will improve thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish government Keith Brown Carmichael called for “unreasonably” entry into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection generates the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but also the economic strength of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the United Kingdom."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for high-speed rail connections in Scotland, the benefits for all and the connection to Glasgow-Edinburg that the Scottish Government already plans.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to decide the next steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft are provisionally in force in Australia
Australian flight passengers must also continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing, despite efforts in the United States to block the arrangements for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their standards so that passengers on their devices can read e-books during critical flight phases, see or play videos if they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it embarrassing that they cannot read their e-books at the start and the landing.
Australian companies observe the decision that the US airlines have to make on-the-job immunities, but do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
The Authority also stated that the announcement will be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia are still in force.
‘The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft’ was launched.
The subject is subject to provisions which accompanying airlines maintain safety at all times and require passengers to follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already talked to the CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi maintenance system to flights and explained that it was open to changes but had to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would like to have a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer now (free maintenance) during the flight," said one speaker.
However, it has been stated that it will remain under the current rules until further notice.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used at start-up and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change this," the company said.
The FAO regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly see the FAO decision as well as the reasons for it.
The decision applies to American companies, depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate malfunctions by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handpacking programs and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can pass through the use of portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at all levels”, declared the FAO.
In rare cases when viewed badly, the Crew will show the passengers while the equipment is switched off.
In addition, the group recommends that heavy equipment be safely concealed at the start and landing during the seat or in the compartments over the seats.
In front of the Revierderby vs. Schalke, they provided suitable BVB trailers for horse scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced the consequences of this.
Before Friday's game of football Bundeslaga against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultrasound first responded with a swig.
It was an unusual, almost penthouse acoustic which was held by the viewer until shortly before the launch of the German Vizemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
The guests were mostly with their beds.
In contrast to where the most reliable of the faithful - and the loudest - BVB fans stood, the South Tribunes first presented themselves unusually: no songs, no strike calls.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise co-ordinates the common fuel, remained unemployed.
And just ahead of the tribune, there is a big front with the title "Secret Stadion Ban".
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player to play the place, burned short-term Jubel up.
As his teammates followed, there were loud voices and silent shells - but no longer anywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune there was nothing right.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again told the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not care for holiday wages.
Just five minutes before the amphibious approach, the Capo got his podest - and until that very hand-cuffed effort came out in a loud cry, as Dickel used to ask the vote on the rings at the stadium.
As a last time, the South-West was like always on the line - and finally was here again as usual at the last place in the stadium.
And at least as soon as the South-West approach came the loud call "The Mayor stands up," everything was as usual again.
The weakness before was probably an reaction to the events of the past day.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the most suitable BVB trailers had been fired into the sightlights and burned on the spot - and then nearly torhuter Roman Weidenfelder.
The game was delayed due to the chaos scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable term for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultrasound movement," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate action, Watzke told the Ultrasa a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he said.
The zero-tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnics cannot be described.
In addition, the Ultrasounds were shown different possibilities of punishment - up to the day of service they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, so Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty until the end of the next week.
"That's going to be cut off," said the security guard.
You have to be tired of how the reactions on the south-east side come out.
Pfan house trees in Singapore, as the crisis in the Middle East has come
In a pfandhaus in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armraif, a ring and a couple of earrings to pay the fees of her daughter.
"My husband and I just bought a house, because my whole money goes into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative worker and her husband also works, the monthly income does not exceed her income, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South-East Asia – where the debt of households is increased – is so great that ValueMax, where she has taken her exchange this week, became the third pfanda house placed on the Singaporean bridge.
The acquisition of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as cheap as an insecure bank loan.
Typically, Pfan households in Singapore require an effective 17 per cent annual rate, which is only slightly over 15.4 per cent, which the United Overseas Bank requires, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Pfanhäääers offer the advantage that there is no need for a credit rating or income check here, as long as loans are available to banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region return to foster homes after families are forced by rising living costs and an increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and fair loans due to a tighter financial policy in developed economic spaces, families with lower and medium incomes are looking up pfan households to balance the difference between supporting economies.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product, following the Agency's assessment.
Malaysia stands at 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
People's economics are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing lack of export and an increase in consumer demand.
“In the end effect it means that, at higher costs, people will be tried in the medium to low segment (the income scale) to end their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economy at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical heights at the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend towards the replacement of personal objects as people take advantage of the opportunity to transform the beauty of the family into Bargeld.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items collected are in the 200-pound houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get our grandmother's chain of gold and come back in next month."
The largest Thai fashion operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in the last few months.
The growth in foot-and-mouth business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the nearby Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week to spend in Singapore.
While some creditors have been condemned for high interest rates in cross-fire, Yeah explains that pfandhouses not only pay more interest than other suppliers, but also not directly increase debt.
"Clients lend items they already own, and the fluctuating personal property does not increase the budget deficit," she explains.
The loan business is increasingly accepted by society as a short-term, secure financing.
Also, not all people who use pfan meat are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to celebrate gold bars and Rolex watches, where they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
To us customers come from every social store.
“This includes beneficiaries who will lend something for a business or investment in a short term, or small companies that have to break their pockets in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA protects data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthyler Edward Snowden has a primary interest in helping Germany to identify increasingly fragile NSA ports.
After the presentation of the Green Bundesday Chief of Staff, Hans-Christian Ströbele, at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, asked what conditions the former secret service staff would have to meet at a German government agency or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströble said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman health care
The Australian government is under strict conditions which are related to the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the taxable health care to ensure that the Government of the United States cannot lose money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to end a crisis that has been caused by an older population of the island, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic constraints.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent tax agent Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down a package of emergency corrections which we consider to be the only challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes 31 million immediate aid for electoral services.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic inputs and treatments due to gray Star, should eliminate withdrawals.
In addition, there is money for day-care clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better after-care for stationary stays, vocational training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic record of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that my clinical staff have told me they are the best way to improve the taxana health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister was responsible for a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Customs Government.
The State must maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were issued.
A three-year-old Commission is established and should ensure that health services are provided to the State as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public taxaman health system to a more sustainable course."
In spite of this, he commended the government for responding to its urgent request for help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the Federal aid will make a great contribution to taking the public health system of the State from the list of concerns," says Wilkie.
According to the Government of the United States, these elections will be largely closed.
However, the health-political speaker of the opposition to the Federal Republic of Germany, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's advertising is just a "plastal solution".
"We are in today's position because the Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It can't be that a government will save nearly half a billion dollars from the system and cover the Commonwealth 300 million and then do as the good news is.
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that no one dollar of the rescue package would be issued for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons production facilities and Gitftgasmination, the Global Monitoring Group for Chemical Weapons stated on Thursday, while it came in the north of the country to have severe conflicts near one of the sites where toxic substances must be stored.
Also on Thursday a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years before the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the end of the
1 November, which was set up in the Hague by the organization Damascus to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to make “inoperable” including all machinery for the mixing of chemicals into toxic gases and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is based on the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious plan aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
As a result, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including sanfgas and Nervengas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fighting in the city of Safira, experts said there was a production facility for chemical weapons as well as warehouses such as the Syrian human rights observation site in Britain.
On Thursday, 120,296 people died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 dispersed soldiers and 5,375 combatants of the opposition, many of whom were foreign.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict from March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observation site said it gave losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fight highlights the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syrians from his toxic weapon arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen and survived the destruction of all the important production and supply facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the cities listed by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were both locations according to a Syrian statement, stated that the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were reduced to other such facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the cities in Safira were one of the two institutions that could not visit OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hat before the absence and the courage you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years, the main Sunni Muslim rebellions in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many of the Alavites.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Zorn on judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come to Bali in 2002 to the bomb attack reacted strongly to the verdict of the last of the defendants brought before the court, as Umar Patek should be shot at in a standard manner.
Patek, who was nearly ten years old as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia on the flight, was sentenced yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack to a 20-year prison sentence.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder due to the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, of which 88 Australians were injured and many others were injured.
In addition, a claim was made in a number of terrorist charges, which were considered to be a wave of explosive attacks against the church in Indonesia on Friday of the year 2000.
The government had called for a life sentence, even if it could apply for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also called "Demolitation Man" who could have applied for the death penalty.
The decision has caused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin sister Jane and Jenny in the destruction approved by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
With trains fighting, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow the steps of the other guys.
"You should put him before a fire order," Courtes said against AAP.
I have to live every day so I won't get any more simple ones and I'll never see my daughter again.
The Sari Club was compared to the ground floor when, on 12 October 2002, a violent bomb exploded in a small cargo that was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer was allowed to explode a rocket filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into coma and “death” three times during a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek had earned the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cells Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samura – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were arrested four years ago.
Indeed, this type should receive the death penalty in front of all others.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years to get after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who stood before the court.
He refused almost a decade of arrest, but finally in January 2011 he was arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbotabad, where U.S. combat forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret reports had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet the goal of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't lie," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown a laugh for how much suffering he has added to other people.
The trial took place before the tenth anniversary of the attack in this year, which will be held with Memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many trains this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his trial.
FAA: Air guests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct phone calls)
Air carriers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not to telephone with the phone, so the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect such changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, despite their respective airlines, FAO staff Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAO that aircraft comply with the new Directives and that they have updated the flight personnel training manuals as well as the rules for the interpretation of devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that wanted to develop the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"You could soon accept the increased use of electronic devices according to the state of the plan," said the FAA in a statement.
At this time passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They can start again only if the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain has green light.
When entering the country flight, the air passengers must turn off again and must not start again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, air carriers whose aircraft could be safe against electronic disturbances allowed their passengers to use the equipment even at start-up, landing and roll-off, the FAA stated.
Most of the new traffic vehicles and other flights converted for use by Wi-Fi to larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional flight crew, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regime is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airlines – both sides will benefit from it,” commented Glading.
We are truly sorry to have to feel like a shepherd on this subject.
However, Internet connections to surfing, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or downloads of data within three kilometres remain prohibited, the authorities explained.
Passengers are required to place smartphones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
So not yet "Words With Friends", the Scrabble resembled online game played by actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the plane.
And harder devices such as laptops must also continue to be understood, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is located at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAO.
FAO may prohibit certain electronic devices at start-up and landing
Last month Mark Rosenker said by the National Transport Safety Board, security experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances on navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitters,” says Rosenker.
A Branch Advisory Committee called by FAO to investigate this topic in its life recommends that the Government allow for a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on FAO has increased to block restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of devices has become of general value.
In some studies the talk is that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by air carriers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices were made known by the UK radios that were then the latest technical trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference.
Flights offer passengers for several years Wi-Fi when the altitude is reached.
The flights adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new Directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally give significantly less radio than previous generations.
For example, e-reader only provides minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is used to prevent the blocking of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees purchased a passenger plane full of children E-reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not determine.
Members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passage Association of Airlines said that he was the view that the destruction by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other Committee members said that there were only a single report of pilots talking about a destruction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommends that the FAA allow pilots, in the event of an instrument landing under bad conditions, to order the removal of the devices by passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and referred to them as a sensible adjustment for travellers who were equipped with technical equipment today.
"We are pleased that the FAO recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Re-freeded poultry from the North Sea Bohrinsell air-conditioning service
A per-air correction service at the coast of flying birds, which was created on a North Sea bohrinssel, was released again into nature.
The waterwheel was flew to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the Centre, said: "This water race was probably a winter bird from North Europe which was maintained by the strong wind over the North Sea."
Apparently the created bird sought refuge on the bohrinsel.
He added: "He could no longer fly, why we were contacted with the aid."
When she was released, the waterwheel was cool and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the aim of bringing the economy into a table and defining what those who care for welfare and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov asked over 1,000 leadership forces from the economy, which represented about the sizes of British companies, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey are surprising.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while countries are staging in the EU.
They want new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be promoted by the Government rather than by the long and demanding process of reforming the dark EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders of the view should be returned to Westminster to certain legal subjects, from cartel law to product law.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market because, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulation would be overestimated among the advantages of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 per cent of large companies agreed to the most traditionally European-friendly.
Finally, and most likely, our question of economic leaders has revealed that a significant majority of Britain wants a course towards a change of agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade is not on politics.
This knowledge found in companies of all sizes and leading groups shows that the economy is forced by a "inclusive change" that brings the beginning of trade back to Britain.
It is much – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change in opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this question shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant deterioration of power relations from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our survey shows what is meant by an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.
Alexei Miller of Gasprom named Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasera
The construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria is the beginning of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gasprom said.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian South Stream Gaspipeline section, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the President of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide for more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A dispute between the gas prom and its pendants in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides for an increased risk of conventional routes, such as to be heard by the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with trans-country countries were "always" disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to benefit from prices when the entire project 2015 is operational.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other organized countries should start on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is based on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres Earthgas.
For national and international investors, there is no way forward at the real estate site Germany.
The economic framework data are consistent and the funding options are excellent.
This was the Tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good cyclical framework conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
As German business assets are sought, show the view of the transaction volume, so Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, 31% increased compared to the previous year's average.
In Britain, the Plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobilieninvestments offer an attractive supply," Ulbrich said.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual misconduct against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual misconduct in relation to children, before 2011 cases were raised against child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had never been "in the organization with a case of sexual abuse of children".
Business leader Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another where a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was sentenced to child abuse.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant attorneys, had known him from the first case but did not know the second.
He pointed out that the opening statement of the YMCA against the Commission was also not in the form of a complaint, "there have been external verifications of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as the first front for child safety".
Evidence from the Commission shows much more that the YMCA was informed that it received the secondest assessment of four possible quality audits of the Department of Education and Communities (Minister of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, said that the business management had failed "from me to go" at the setting of Lords and did not ensure that employees were clear about their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced at the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct to twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argues that the YMCA had a cultural problem that kept the employee from reporting the destruction of Lords in relation to the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed injuries, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, they took care of themselves as babysitter, they were sitting on his seat, they said he loved it, and they left kids playing with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose predecessor was Lord and who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child minister Jacqui Barnat, who was the proposed Lords at YMCA Caringbah, “was very impressive and most of the time very approachable”.
The manager stated that he would not accept statements from employees because they had not trusted to replace their proposed notification.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord had affected their judgment powers, so they had not informed him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan Lord's accident" was "not the notification" by employees and that the Board had approved it.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secret obligations shortly after the appearance of the charges was taken by the business director of the YMCA Children's Service, Liam Whitley.
He said that in order to prevent contamination of the evidence, what was “extremely” and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, when no child safe organization was available, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were “sound problems” when setting up, checking, working, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was suspended until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but it is clear that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-olds shared his views on various domestic political issues.
Since his return in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided foreign policy and his comments on foreign policy and his role as messenger of the Quartet of the Peace Charter in the Middle East have been limited.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this is happening, so ...”
When the horse-chau experts arrived at Scharen in Cardiff to see the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid who is not yet in the childhood garden and has just taken his first step a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee was making lockers through the three rounds and held the first price – leaving 30 adults behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were awarded for their performance, behaviour and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his teller-tales in a short angle and led the two years old tofee through the ring.
Fenton was awarded by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony, which is far above his age.
And Tofee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had given Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and has been enjoying every day with Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great effort."
They had to stand against the entire field of participants and went out with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was the second time he had participated in a competition with Tofee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena kept him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the steps of his Aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for more than ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was as electricized and everyone burned him and blamed him."
He loved sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so different, he worked fantastically.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two dogs to take care of.
As he starts, it won't last long until he's on the "fly of the year" stage – and I'm sure he'll be cut off well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jury then assessed Fenton and Tofee how well they had fought and presented in the lead.
They looked at good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there were Fenton and Tofee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fentons' sweet dress has contributed to their part, which is really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper should be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which requested the release of a reporter who was charged with defamation, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later said on television that he had adopted employment money to misappropriate reports about a subsidiary.
The new expression will now be subjected to "absolute rectification", the regulatory authority said.
The “Recommending Order” was issued by the government for press and publications, radio, film and television in GuangDong.
The New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoom million between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The drafting management of the New Express was unorganized," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided to "contain an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw her reporter's license".
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been designated to propose a complete rectification of the New Express and recommend that the relevant officials be identified at the New Express and immediately review the New Express's lead team."
Chen had written several articles for the new expression in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery named Zoom million.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and put himself behind his journalism.
But then Chen appeared on the state television and said he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoom million as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said against the CCTV State Press.
I did it first because I was out of money and peace.
It's clear to me that I've been wrong.
In connection with Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and explained that it was wrong to check the reports correctly.
Several well - known suspects have recently taken a stand on television.
Experts say that circumstances will still be routinely forced, despite a change of law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited to force someone to blame himself.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug abuse between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, heating and electrical operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnel as one of the most crowded passages they've ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zickzack pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area, there are countless unlikely storage halls that make it easier to hide drug-loaded LKWs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unknownly, the authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight tons of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, the records of the court.
Three men, according to the statements of the authorities as drivers, were charged with possession and sale of marijuana and cocaine.
In the event of a claim, you will be sentenced to imprisonment between ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, Schmugglers are placing on an extended underground network of draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large pass that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the Marihuana Ernte in central Mexico in October, which puts the drug cartels ahead of the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meters long pass with skis that were loved by a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Players Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go different ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
An Orlando Bloom has highlighted his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be exposed on Friday (ortime), Bloom said that "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or expect".
He and himself still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is subject to Vegetarianism according to Lexika, but differs from this in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sandstones, ice or a strong edamer, these scars are not on a Veganer's food card.
Milk, cheese, eggs, along with fat on meat and fish, the Veganer will be removed from the total consumption of animal products - even honey will be destroyed.
What remains, one may wonder, but in closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable impact.
"Brout strikes are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the Heisic Reform House, which provides a variety of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the loading in the domgasse.
For 13 years the newborn New Zealander has lived in Vegan, in Lampertheim (fastly) finds everything he needs for life. "I set my food around 1997 and became a vegetarian".
About the end of the century, then the next step was taken and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of food but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the artist leader usually prefers leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
In the first line, Vegan is a ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the maximum of Veganers, who spends their entire consumption.
Instead of trusting citizens, drivers or rubber bars, the Veganer quickly discovered completely new products, which increased the desire.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, vegan doesn't make it a mess, it doesn't matter, but it's an area." The assumption that reducing the choice of foods with food preparation will lead Proctor to return to the power of the habit.
And that is exactly what these conditions have allowed some to pass such a good joint effort.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, like smoking," says Proctor.
And it turns out, "Determined smiles are not to be fixed on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that makes the taste taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings up Aubergines, Champignons and a couple of Veganwürsts.
He looks at a balanced, varied diet, where it should also taste thoroughly once again.
Of course you want something between teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
He did not experience any health damage to food disorders, a further widespread adoption.
For me, conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased amount of vitamin.
There are high-performance salads that only eat vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'll often check," said Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"The animals are fed with food instead of fat on the surface, it is a question whether the meat bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 percentage is high," says Proctor.
For Veganer it also allows you to take coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explained.
There is no need for Proctor to go for food creation.
There are basic foods everywhere, and each supermarket has medium-term Soyamilch and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find a place.
Just leave and I'll buy something special.
"Many people see that just as the finished products are expensive, it is also true of "normal" finished products".
However, the preparation of vegan courts is much more cost-effective and less time-consuming than is generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small knots you can do well if you don't partially achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margaryne instead of Butter, something more back powder and carbonic acid instead of Ei, with its vegan cheese cubes, Proctor could also bring his pregnant parents to the station.
The Veganer provides a new home.
This has a dynamic when you buy it together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as humans themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been opposed by the Creator himself.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I'm drinking milk?" - In such a number of questions, you have to act as a Veganer with a fingertip.
"I don't lie to people, I'm part of this company," Proctor doesn't want to delay the enclavendase.
And more precisely, the daily world does not appear to be as vegan - and the Veganer does not be as restricted as it is in common.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes is everywhere!
"Many dolls offer foals, or even a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he weighs on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, it was even more difficult," the New Zealander may conclude a development: "You have to talk to the people and make them pay attention to it."
"If there are enough questions, they may be willing to finish the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the combuses in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor agrees that other restaurants also have at least a vegan court on the food card.
On the basis, vegan courts have been taken over for all there.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Food courts are exclusive, and although in the true sense of the word, they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandal, Veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part of it impossible before," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products may be somewhat difficult at first.
In particular, if you learn that animal additives can also be found in soilnuts as colour givers, you seem to leave with the pursuit of ethics in so many hearings and cases of courage.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explain the many ingredients, but also foods are added.
"After and after you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to look at "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stay or to climb," says Proctor.
The Veganism, it is an important moral fingertip that attacks consciousness.
It may not be enough for him to establish his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The drill operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in Atem.
The trade on Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday in Germany.
In a communication the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two Nasdaq OMX, continued to put their business unhindered.
The most recent fall continues to set up a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the brewer.
Only on Tuesday were Nasdaq's indexes due to errors in data transport were not calculated for an hour.
In August of this year it had given only two pans a week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent a mass of miscellaneous purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
In this case, the brewers needed almost a whole day to observe and comply with the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock trade in the United States came to an end because of a computer panic at the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
It also provided for the last year of Facebook's tour.
The Nasdaq systems were not increased by the flow of sales and sales orders, later established SEC's stock management and convinced the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: Radler rides 63 years around
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at 22 o'clock, was on the left side of the train station in the direction of the market.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man from a local was on his way to the station, the driver could no longer be on time according to the police.
At the next meeting, the footpath was pushed against the wall of the house, went on to the ground, and went up to about 15 inches [15 cm] long square feet [15 cm] on the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
The British police call Assange for a delivery decision
The British police have today handed over a delivery decision to WikiLeaks-founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been assigned a "demand to make" which required him to appear in a police car, and added that he should not follow him and give him the arrest.
Assange refers the delivery to Sweden because of the complaint in a sexual relationship after its possibilities have been granted according to British law since the Supreme Court has rejected its claim against the delivery of the month's beginning.
Since he was afraid that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "an obligation for a 40-year-old man to make himself at a time chosen by us," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the police demand.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and will be accused of possible spy projects after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks Enthusiast website.
Drivers who were washed between the legs with 210 km/h and hot drink receive 1,000 £ punishment
One car driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 because he was driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 from Tiptree, Essex, was arrested on May 27, with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Court of Justice Colchester, Howie was known to be responsible for not being in danger of the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to payment of costs of £90 and an offer of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London Speculation Blase
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally carried out the CGT measure, but it is still expected that the final decision by Mr George Osborne, who, in the budget of 2012, had a 7 % stamp tax on apartments, which costs more than two million dollars as well as annual fees for buyers, apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The revenue from the stamp tax for housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which in 2012/13 totalled 708 million dollars in tax year, has already exceeded the exemptions for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Nordics, the North West, Yorkshire and the Hummer region.
Cook said: "After the increase in stamp tax on high-priority apartments and the introduction of legislation against an environment, it can be difficult to claim that high-quality properties are low despite the effects of the old Community tax system."
"However, some foreign investors could be able to take this step in terms of the purchase of property in London, or the sale of property by owners," he added.
First-class real estates – the most five to ten percent of the housing market at prices – in the prosperous London Southwest Gyrtel, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased by 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed an annual growth of 5.6 %, but a growing domestic market was overestimated, where a study of Savills was conducted in the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5 %).
Scientists were able to shed more light on the nature of a dog's jaws with its voice.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs with the sword spread more to the right (from the view of the dog), while it was on the left side of nerve dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trient University, said: “It is well known that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli, the positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brains are responsible for the movement of the left side and turn around, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feeling.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their species’s mussels, researchers monitor the animals while these films are related to other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behaviour.
We'll probably soon understand why the dragon once into the one, when it moves into the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dog films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette in order to eliminate other revealing aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the weasel to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise unexpressed dog moved the Swanz to the right (see from the perspective of the wild dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, it was mainly left-wing (again from the perspective of the dog that spreads), so their heart rate increased and they seemed to relax.
According to Professor Valortigara, dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements.
He is more confident that the dogs have learned from experience what moves they should take care of and if not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the vendetta is more related to the trend towards friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly attitude, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners, animal doctors and trainers could help better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol University of Animal Health, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether it was important for dogs to the left and right.
Last year a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog and to the right when it's about a satisfactory dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following were: "Go to a robot dog rather than to a robot dog if it's to his left and not to his right rather than to be disappointed – exactly different from in the Italian study."
According to him, therefore, the differences could lead to the fact that dogs in different studies did not interpret animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are significant locations for many different mammals that both brain parts are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not constitute an exception there”, says Bradshaw.
But since your behavior is easy to record, it will probably not last long until we understand why snow sometimes moves into one, sometimes into the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys Move Up in Glasgow because of Alex Turners' Disease
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has moved an event in Glasgow after its lead singer has been sick at neck head start.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the disease of the sufferer Alex Turner, the concert must now be transferred.
The announcement of the band came after it had already had to move to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show in LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, and on the medical board, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show in Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"In Alex Turner's case, a headache has been diagnosed, so it can't occur. "
The show in LG Arena in Birmingham is now held on 20 November, which was delivered in Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets are valid for this show.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.

Pope Francis appointed the first cardinal in February
On February 22nd, Pope Francis was the first to call for new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican was known on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who choose a pope so that Franciscus will be named the first group of men who will eventually be involved in the election of his followers.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the papal election – this is due to a group of 120 “chosen cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistorium.
"Papst Francisco has decided to announce his decision to introduce the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would be likely to decline by February.
He explained that a pope generally lowers as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals will be returned to 120, and as many cardinals as he wants.
The composition in the next year is therefore important because it has been the first since the election of Franciscus in March this year, Valero.
At present there is a certain overlap between Europe and Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Cardinal will be removed from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a variable number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called upon since the establishment of the Council of cardinals established by France to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the mandate to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything by himself.
"Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "good possible" that Franciscus asked the cardinals for advice.
But until then we were not in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that the bishops would normally be called cardinals from large places, but the French "full surprises – we don't know who he's appointed".
GM calls back new pickup tricks in the United States to repair the seating
General Motors called back at least 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with 2014 to address a problem with manually arranged seating, so a communication from the US Vehicle Safety Authority on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason they do not comply with the Federal Vehicle Safety Guidelines.
“If you are driving from behind the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the insects properly, so that there is an increased risk of injury,” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website (NHTSA).
The models applied were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM pressures began in June and represents the most important start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owner in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letters because of the 16-day government Shutdowns, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, was increased by 20% during the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup Trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 per cent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Disappointment of an Obama chooser
I have chosen President Obama twice to hope that change will be possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been defeated by the Republican blockade.
The blockade policy does not blame the website problems of Obamacare, the drug attacks
Obama's memories of the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a terrible sad book right now.
It's a book I believed would raise me up during the past two years of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts the memory of Barack Obamas on the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm finished at night with my patient papers and go to bed, then the book will take me back to a time when the politicians inspired millions and could breathe a word.
The election was held as an earthquake and news speaker to show the historical significance of this hour in front of the eyes.
My classrooms were happy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visioners was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama then moved to the office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back on the current is a bad wake as if you're getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be an empty memory, a sad meal of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has really changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and varied things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Act on the Inviolable Care for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the political blockadetics have taken many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay just to name a few.
However, after I have defended the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my statements.
I have reached a point of political confusion.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign government officials are allowed to shut down or kill innocent children by means of overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why Whistbleblower is being punished for public misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaka, an American citizen of the United States, was murdered without proceedings, or why public funding and expenditure limits will be passed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which means that the White House's efforts to calm the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government".
And at the very least it cannot justify the inability to design a simple website within more than three years of the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood with 18 that the government's work could be opposed to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Board of Directors is not a predictable course, as a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are presenting the public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be widely chosen by the government itself.
And that's what's bothering me most of the time.
I chose Obama again in 2012 because I wasn't interested in his candidate.
With Romney there was a confusing and unwarranted alternative, which seemed impossible to determine his direction and position.
I had the impression, a second official time for Obama, free from the pressure of future choices, that would fill the hope we had heard so long.
However, with the decline in the agreed value for Obama by less than 45 % this week, the return in 2008 has become so difficult.
It wakes up in me the desire to see after the many promises they've made in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to hide a serious loss to Clinton at the election in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his staff that they had to go back to course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our sugar again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I can't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest during parental leave
The billionaire and vice-president Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughter could become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mountain-builder, who was in a court-in-law substitute for the payment of $6 million on CO2 tax, raised the charge when he wanted to ask the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate which are important for the decision whether or not the CO2 and mountain construction taxes are being levied or reduced.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
“He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to parental leave paid, because if one of his daughter becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission announced 53 votes in favour after recounting officially to win the Fairfax Sunshine Coast Session.
Palmer asked for a revision of the voting process so that this could be replaced more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Whether these choices should be made two months after the end of the vote.
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you are rein Marching the data into a computer immediately selects and then has the result at 6:30 p.m. at night?
Palmer also criticised the use of flashlights when marking the vote list.
Do you use it because you can tell the results if they don't fall?
Today, it's incredible to agree with my wishes.
The Electoral Commission has examined options for an electronic choice and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
At a public office it's about public service.
"We do not wish for any reward other than history, namely that we can serve at a critical time in this Community," he said.
RBS suspends two device handlers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its currency division, so two people who are confident of the situation; this is a further indication that the global government's approach to the required manipulations on the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including BB, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world’s largest financial market, which changes the owners to $5.3 billion a day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal was about the Libor Interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests from authorities.
"Our findings on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation showed that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages to the British Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority, to a former dealer.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and should have been allowed to be at JPMorgan's European Forex Spot Trade Leader from his current position.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and BB, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were required to commit any misconduct.
To the instant message group of Usher, bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup said the situation was coming.
It was announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had stated that it was investigating a significant manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Justice Ministry and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with premises, where banks should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also initiated internal investigations or received requests from authorities, said trusted persons in the situation.
Banks come instant messages and e-mails from several years to search for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put the trader in an area of disturbance, which has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currency limits the chances for speculants.
Some banks have tried to play down the business and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extended and high-quality liquid currency market, but leading dealers are the view that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in retail trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks led to “one can influence the market with very few ticket prices.”
The message came out that same day, as Credit Suisse was known, she announced this week a trader of her London Exchange Traded Fund Offices after he lost nearly six million dollars last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and worked with them.
“We are sure that the trader has dealt alone and that the matter is under way,” said Credit Suisse.
Paints the building on the base of the tile
A group of citizens' initiatives "Swiezer Wise" has decorated the building on the concrete ground at the body promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned up and spread the way, which is in a press release.
The planned discovery of the collapse house in the back of the ground was not allowed for safety reasons, as the land is about to be disposed of.
Alfred Abel, who now manages the foundation, had spoken to his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the operation of the BI was a transparent with the message "We've been brought for this."
However, about 20 members of the citizens' initiative did not interfere with their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We're against the bourgeois".
So she wanted to point out the danger of even greater damage to Switzerland - the rice project should be cut off one day.
In a discussion with many passengers before the "building site" it was made clear that some citizens believe that it will be much better with the implementation of the city's project, although there are not very few same questions about the size of the project presented, such as the BI.
But they started to resign it because the city continues to delay these answers, which is on the side of the BI.
As it was to be heard, the public statements of the Mayor also appear.
In May, at the Community meeting, he had said that he feared the outside of the thermal bath, the population should agree with the plans for a bath and wellness complex in the Swiss way.
Some appear to be just too tired, others feel like "pumping pressure test" on the population, which is further mentioned in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the help.
Ranknick-scheek for Schiris: Manne no swalbenkung
So satisfied with the current high-level form of the Bundesliga Table Leader Red Bull Salzburg, Ralf Langnick was also disappointed by the sports director of the "Bullen" by the judge.
"There is now a dangerous trend to pressure Mane and Alan into the category of Swalben Kings," he took the two OffensiveWirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
Younger exposure to Rankicks Critics was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Gradige last Sunday, when the Senegalese read a alleged actor to be arrested - which was not as freely shown by TV images.
"A broken decision of absence," said Ranknick, the judge named Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam had also contributed "his share" to the scaling between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsmann defended him: "I would have treated myself like Roger Schmidt in any situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the closet.
I didn't know why.
"For I am the one who was ordained," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success course, however, Ranknick agreed to a prize.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he noted.
There's not much to be done.
In particular, the manner and manner in which the human race plays is impressive.
That's supposed to go so quietly.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transit period.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"In addition to the desire of a player to leave the company," said Ranknick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the strict health law relating to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judge ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance by 2014 or to pay a penalty – is constitutionally constitutional in the framework of the State’s government’s control.
The chief judge, John Roberts, fought on the side of the four more liberal members of the House, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page legislation and also confirmed the view that the provisions of the Health Act should be extended either by the States or by the States of the United States to extend access to medicine or otherwise by all state medical supplies.
The complaint procedure against the law was enforced by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the pre-election war 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place is made with rice mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian Urtchen brought light into its quiet valley.
Due to the low sun exposure, the Rjukan from Herbst to Spring usually falls in the shadow of the surrounding mountains in the Westfjord Valley.
With three giant reflections in 45 meters high, a century-long room was realized on Wednesday.
"At last!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland was shocked at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the residents of Tale were right behind sunglasses, others on safety half of the sunglasses.
Until then, sunflowers had to ride in winter with a sailboat on a nearby hill.
Ten years ago the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to link the beams with mirrors into the hall.
But this fundamental idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city had finally approved the 5 million euros (about EUR 615 000) of your project.
A similar construction has been granted for several years by the Italian Alps Viganella Winter Sunshine.
Poster is not ready for Sunday
"Many citizens have not yet noticed that the red points for the sunlighting are still in different letter boxes of the core city and the parts of the city, but if you read the little print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will soon find that the reading of Sundays and holidays is no longer happening," says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post-construction building in the Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and Jacob-Müller Street 1 will be taught in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is still taught in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth policy speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to look here.
Sunday training is an important post-service at Terminpost.
"This business, despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, is radically and irrefutable."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' Group and Urban Union, supports his group colleagues: "What I admire is the fact that the teaching times are changed or are being pushed in secret here."
The post is far away from the city.
"At least the letter boxes in the parts of Neuschlost and Rosengarten must be taught again on Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck Unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens had to be able to obtain a letter box with Sunday instruction.
Røhrrenbeck asked the City Parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lamberheim.
But in Hofheim there is also a Sunday instruction.
Your party has already spoken for privatizations.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," said Mayer.
Frankfurter Park charges should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more and more expensive.
Today, the city's Magistrate offers a proposal by Mr. Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking charges should therefore be increased by 50 per cent.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking and parking lots should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, then, the City Council has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Single Trade Committee holds the "for no good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "a non-estimating advantage for smaller dealers".
The transport club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "appropriate and actually overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast overruns Guests
With a small frame, the Lords of the TSV Freudenstadt had to appear in the Schiller-Schulturnhall in Routlingen against the TG Gönningen by the Swiss Alb.
However, the apples were with an experienced man on the other side.
But soon it turned out that she, even in her old age, could not fully comply with the rapid actions of the city of joys.
With the hard and positioned surfaces, the gonningers were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Edward Schulz clean through the network and were not in place at the lockdown.
Two high first-ranking satisfactories highlighted the superiority of the city of joy in all its interests.
In view of this impressive and decisive performance, then the third sentence was somewhat light and smooth to 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbrunn, which could be clearly implemented in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Düller, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Edward Schulz.
In the B-class, the second team from Baiersbronn and Freuden town were against the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points of interest, especially when taking ballasts; also in the legs, the precision of both the missing instruments and in some critical games prevented the superiors from looking at possible points.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed through great physical use and a happy commitment of both teams.
Date of delivery at the small English farm
A group of engaged participants met in the small English hotel in Ibach, following the Natura 2000 project.
In view of recommendations made by the population that day, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said, the look at the hall should be cut off in the valley.
Many travelers named this area as the glamour of the castle, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the audience for their willingness to work together and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen human and natural relations.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations can be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friedriche Tribukit from the Department of Natural Protection of the Freiburg Government Bureau in connection with the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen management and wanted a good ring of action.
The tourist objective of the broader view is according to Tribukit with the aim of achieving a wide-ranging old public area with its specific protected living room types by opening and connecting to the existing areas.
Certain species such as rare schmetterlings andgrassuffers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections for maintenance.
Tribuit said she did not want to miss this place to break a chain for the planned biospherical area.
In this plan, the current measure does not just come into play.
A biospherical area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and therefore continues to complement the achievements achieved by the life project as well as the previous deadlines for the future.
After these different performances, Revier Director Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in the field, the forest skipper was ready to jump if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wacholderbücken and the provision of a dry stone ring.
Target was the free view at the point of view.
Openings: Buyers Still Single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Barstadchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city works as an attractive city, no second candidate has yet been announced.
As a single candidate for the follow-up of the candidate mayor Norbert Brugger for age reasons, the 46-year-old banker and businesswoman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen have so far been identified.
The period of application shall expire on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group, which had thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed a complaint of patent damage against telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was awarded to Nortel’s insolvency promotion.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the North patent for 4.5 billion US dollars, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies of the U.S. District Court of Texas of patent damage.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is dealt with in seven cases with the damage of the patent.
The patents relate to technology that brings search terms online with relevant advertising in line with the complaint that comes to the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC set up phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in excellent competition for Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last cost $4.4 billion.
After it was awarded to the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion for a business that was also motivated by motorolas library to patents.
“Although Google is divided by his attempt to acquire the petitioner at the auction, Google has damaged the patents and continues to do so,” he writes.
Rockstar demands a high level of damage from Google, as it claims that Google's patent damage is deliberate, so the charge.
Egypt Destroys First-elected Presidents
Mohammed Mursi leaves office, but his day of triumph must not mean the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was destroyed as the first free president of the country and thus suffered the consequences of Husni Mubarak, which had been released from the office 16 months before.
With its introduction before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first free-elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the collapse of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He left the Eid before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robin, who has his seat on the Nile and has found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We look forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the festival ceremony that was transferred to the state television.
"Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim fraternity, a fundamentalist group that has been taken mainly as a banned organization since its establishment 84 years ago by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen are guarding the building when Mursi entered a small car van shortly after 11 hours.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to appeal to the new presidents, and in contrast to the presidiumary spring from Mubarak time, the traffic was only temporarily stopped so that the car can cross the usually inhabited roads that connect the city centre with the southern presidents.
As a non-characterist "Eraszzarzrad" of the fraternity, his personal prestige has taken place since his victory and a free date, in which he has not only been a candidate for Islamists but has presented all of them who wanted to target the efforts of the revolt from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wooden-bedroom in which he laid down his office.
Later Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to keep his attitude.
He was officially welcomed by an army officer who played the national humne that he belonged to in Habatt.
Hussein Tantawi was present by the military commander of the field Marshal.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the largest hearing hall of the University with speakers from "The Army and the People are a hand."
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a base for secular education, developed into a group of Islamic students in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi released a symbolic eid on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the revolt which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubaraks, and he hoped to claim presidial powers taken by the military council from the head of state.
However, with the resignation of the official eed before the Court and not as usual before Parliament, he is concerned about the will of the military, which indicates that the struggle will continue.
Mursis Rede on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet".
Today's Friday evening is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening goes with a 25-party.
Fat Beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on two days.
Workers beat by leaders: seriously injured
On Thursday, when a disabled outsider was changed, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg was beaten by a leader and seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechthouse wanted to exchange a defective sense of heating at the outside of a guest house.
When he stepped up to the leading of the roofs, he pulled out this road and the man ran on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the National Hospital of Salzburg with the rescue surgeon "Christoforus 6".
Violence in South Africa: Two Lifelong Seas
Nine months after the brutal rape and genocide of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the father was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had been eliminated from all over the country.
The 21-year-old Anene Boyysen had raped in February in an industrial area near Cape Town in Bredasdorp.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the life of the sacrifice, but persisted.
The view of young people was so sensitive that nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had given up during the process to be in a bar at night with boys.
He also tried to beat them and force them, but he struggled to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police were first released from several aunts, but two suspects left the port because the evidence did not match them.
The government authorities also stressed during the procedure that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa rapes are almost daily: Each year there are about 64,000 ads due to sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark figures in sexual violence but at the 10th to 25th stage.
Jumbo is visiting the Black Forest.
Jumpo is looking for the "best gifts of the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 Star Bondorf visited.
The speaker makes the same point at the beginning: The most important for the present are the pigeons, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can gifts be obtained in every supermarket, so can they be a quality product?
Uli, the head of the large Schinken factory in Schwarzwald, explains how the company "Adler" works in Bondorf.
"Germany's favorite gift," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest Gift.
Only with hair protection and kittel comes into the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can touch the micro.
Jumbo for rapid growth in Waldshut
"This is where I'm working a lot," the television maker, Black Forester Schinken, said as a mass product.
16,000 hills per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat part, colour: Uli explains where it comes from when it comes to quality.
Most pigs are killed by six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the P-value of the meat also play a role.
I think the meat is higher than the p-value.
"That's what I'm trying to do if you're Roberto Blanco, what happens then," said Jumbo.
Here the level of private television is presented in Reincultur.
But the look is still worth it.
The observer sees that the melting of the tunnels is still working.
Because: Black-and-white jewellery is traditionally to be found without bones in the regular.
The secret of the present is the mixture with the salt.
Smoking storm and smoking remember Jumbo optically on an "U-boat".
The trick: toothbrushes are here for the special taste of the black forest.
20 days in smoking make the gifts almost black.
"Now the disc in Jumbo disappears," he announces the test rehearsal.
"It's really nice," says the fact of the TV star.
This allows all participants to live.
Did you think travel offices belong thanks to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profits for the entire year and is expected to record receipts of vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company is now going from an adjusted annual income before taxes of between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As business leader Graham Turner was known, Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and bought a strong start in the second half of the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have benefited, and some of them are in a good way towards annual revenue for interest and taxes,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typical of our greatest results.
In Australia, in the second half of the year, the leisure industry has gained a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the Flight Centre's free time business in the United Kingdom, while business customers are also less expensive here.
The U.S. business was in line with the season's weakest first half year, so a profit for the third year will be expected for the entire year.
Flight Centre shares rise by 3 cents a day to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are kept to a greater focus on mathematics, legislation and grammar
In courses in English literature, students must treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyric and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The test also includes “invisible texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students have had to set up their own GCSE test for language, where there is strong motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new educational plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first faeces that have been radically redesigned.
Other core sinks will be modified next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new operating system and fewer courses.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools there is less time for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week – than in most other countries.
In contrast, teaching Australian schools average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there is no formal requirement to schedule more time for mathematics in the hour plan, from coalition circles, the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weight of the field in range lists – will likely encourage schools to set more hours.
The learning plan focuses more on "studies from the right way of life", including financial thematics.
Lock beautiful animals and beautiful gardens
The most beautiful canyons of different races and color beds present the cross-banding view on this weekend in the city hall.
The evaluations have already been carried out on Thursday
The W514 will renovate this large exhibition.
The breeders of the Associations in the District of Soest show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder Hobbyholder their rabbits.
On Thursday, six award-winners took the assessment of many rabbits and were able to appoint outstanding animals.
The visitors will be better informed as the assessment of all animals has been carried out at the cabins.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place at 2.30 p.m. by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday.
For all visitors, the Kaninchen watch on Saturday is open from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., which includes the victory.
Guests are also invited to a tomola with local prices and to a delicious café.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Okumenian Discussion Forum
On Monday, 21 October, at the new museum of the castle the theme "To Hell with the Hall - Theological considerations for today's relationship with the last things".
The reference is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Öcummenic forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical churches Salem, the Salem castle and the Cultural Heritage Area.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum on the question of how today people enter the "last things" after death.
If people in the past century had known too much about this and had placed it on those images of heaven and hell, "which have been our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic teachings of the hopes for fulfillment are more indicated by a certain opportunity or even by languagelessness.
"The greatest hope is that Christians and Christians have been excommunicated by the criticism of religion," says the referendum.
She has "encouraged us with so many questions that we seem to be able to get the triggers down."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the responsibility of death."
This is why the question is linked to the search, "the dream of being able to do everything well at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She was promoted to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Öcummenic Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has entered a school for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the small Heuberg confirm their faith in the firm
In two services, 101 15 and 16-year-olds of the unit of soul care were established at Smallen Heuberg.
On the morning of the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the youth group, The Spirit, on the afternoon of the Youth Chore.
By accepting the firmament, the young people said yes to their baptism and prayed for the power of the holy spirit.
The companies had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the community on the great festival day.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian congregation and shared experiences of the youth’s day in Under-Machael.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike race desired participants
At great weather, 214 drivers came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hills around the sea.
This is part of Ulrich Knobel of the Illmensee sports organization.
Among the participants, in particular at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 altitudes, there were a number of individuals who wanted to exercise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior runners of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation that good locations be placed at the German masters.
These two were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a short period of time to the goal and defend his title as a winner of the short distance.
In place of two, Pascal was able to place itself again.
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team Albtraum, which created it all up on the winning points.
On place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Oweningen.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the Community.
Not only with regard to performance, all band widths were represented by athletes.
The age structure also reached the age of ten in the youngest to over 70 at the oldest starters.
In this year's main break, there were still more absolute top tiles at the start.
Four drivers were able to get away from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl was with a teammate already twice World Master in the 12-hour train.
In this year he became a European master in this special discipline.
In addition, Roland Ballerstadt, who has already named himself two German master titles in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 altitudes, there was a Wipern Schlag final in the course of the trip to the Tri-See Hall.
Pangerl was the first to hit the target line.
Only one second later could the Routinier Ballerstadt ensure the second place in the overall assessment.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third of the overall evaluation.
In the lady rating, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main ranks.
The second place was secured by Arenane Blersch from Binswane before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsers and assistants were very pleased with the smooth and well-organised course of the event.
Underway through skimmed, flowing and skiing for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bülle brings free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Belle and his team spend almost every week to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Voice out here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Balle belongs to Top 10 of "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in Top 10 to select him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
21 years ago Georges Walle saw his sick father again lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that didn't have the means to help him.
Jamef Balle was injured in 1981 by a car crash near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then he formed a dispersion that spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurochirurgen in Cameroon," said Georges Bülle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Belle spent many years accompanying his father in hospitals and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Walle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Welles Father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most cameras couldn't pay for the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Belle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen were suffering from seeing him and his decision to do something about it.
Dr. George's Walle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations in the last year.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a dentist at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a joint organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people are forced into a small bus and ride with the skilful medical equipment on the roof over undamaged terrain into the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always run smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through floods and floods.
But when they arrive, they will receive them like heroes: a fortress, song and dance and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason for the celebration and the well – with its wide smile and its unlimited energy – is pleased with the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team will then begin with a survey of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per drive”, says Bülle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crunches, broken glasses or free births – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local maintenance.
The operations usually take place in a school, a rathouse or a apartment; after the attack the patients stand up and go to the reception area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the group generator and works so well and its volunteers work until early in the morning on Sunday.
It's an intense pensum, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drown all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Belle.
On Sunday the team will then return to the city, Mude, but proud of the work done.
The group – a combination of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the last year and knows that it makes a huge difference with its work for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a service bridge he was receiving now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Belle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his joint activity, so well; the rest is from private expenditure.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and volunteerly working in the wells group during the second year.
He is always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital care students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support the Belle, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences they would never get home.
"We can be at operations where we help, drop blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Walle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon for themselves and often bring with them expensive health material.
But it is only once in Yaoundé, which takes over the transportation, transport and guidance.
"There is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, he knows no limits.
For Belle, the almost constant work is no burden.
To help others lead a happier life and to fulfill a promise that he has made to his Father is a source of great joy to him.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Belle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laughter and to relieve the pain.

Excellently deserves the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novell "The Old Man and the Sea", is broken by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old essay in his metal, the play art.
The old man Santiago can't make anything at fishing.
So they're just great.
It is almost possible to see the fall in the neck of the old man from whom the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of living sitting on the chair, that's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that is excellently mastered by Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and finally won the fight against the fish by his knowledge and his willpower.
Janson is in a wide range as a single player on the stage.
He makes it possible to focus on the public's attention, so that his monologues are not long-term.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so true that the observers forget that the sea is only made up of blue-lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act on the boat before the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights each active scene: the hall of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luce Gunst, which ensues the feeling of living with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cubas Rhythmus and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Rise to the Romans
At about 120 meters long, a drain can be obtained from the Roman time under the hill.
Whoever visits Coln doesn't come through the court.
About 157 meters lay the two towers in the sky and make them the second largest church building in Europe.
However, only a few visitors who attend the two filigrant churches do not know that there is a lot to discover under the court.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Kölner's world.
The service centre of Köln-Tourism is located directly at Dom.
The tour starts completely unexpected: "We are caught in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city’s fathers wanted a city of their own, so the rest of the old city walls remained only what was not too big.
Most of the users of the parking lot are therefore also passing through the rest of Rome and leaving their car alone.
However, the more accurate view, the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archeological base separated by metal-guilters.
To see are about five meters high ruins from hand-size stones.
"It is the rest of the Roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze allows the participants at the upper parking area to throw another look into a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the source of the old house, which is unfortunately not even taken for granted.
The next station of the tour is the Pretoria, and here the participants climb back into the deep.
Here we experience the office of the first powerful man north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
What the CCAA means is a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation is for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinsium", which in good German means as much as "The city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippas, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the worship of the emperor".
And at the Pretoria it is about the former Stattal Palace, the centre of the power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front of the exhibition, it leads to a tunnel access to the Roman water channel, which is located around 120 metres long.
"They can quietly take a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," says Schulze to the guests.
A surprise still has lessons.
After holding the key at the box, he leads the group to a depth of 16 meters.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bathroom deep in the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwei, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water conditions are possible through changing peaks of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the site where construction work should begin soon.
But some years will pass before completion.
Nearly pulled out: New surface of Rocker process
A blood attack in Rockermileu will be reregistered after more than four years.
A process due to attempted assaults, physical injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Land Court of Frankfurt (Or).
He will be accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants are weak to the task.
They should have been active in the rock scene and then belong to the bandidos.
In June 2009, they were invited to join three men in a car with unknown complications in Finowfort.
All the victims were severely injured. A man had almost lost his leg.
The victims should have belonged to the competitive group Hells Angels.
One should be a high-ranking member from Berlin.
In the past, there seemed to be a wave of persecution with several cars.
According to the complaint, there was a revolution and a demonstration of power.
The two complainants were released at the beginning of 2012 in a first procedure.
A judge then said that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bleeding.
The aunts had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice upheld the judgment following the revision of the State Administration and referred it back to the Land Court for renegotiation.
One of the defendants is now due to another delicture in an open appeal.
In particular, it was about the reconstruction of the works in the night.
As a witness, the Commissioner was then informed.
In the center were telephone conversations between the defendants and other persons who had been heard by the police.
It is difficult for Rocker to stand before the court almost always on a previous law - and not to pay attention to it.
That's also true of the victim.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed.
The state attorney Stefan Golfier from the government agency Frankfurt (Or) said on request that new traces have been raised since the last procedure.
There are 11 further negotiations for the process.
The company doesn't think so.
The night was long, the music sounded good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: The hunger is noted in the people's books on the driver's seat and back.
Of course, the person may be responsible for one or more cocktails or sects!
What's more important than driving to the next drive in order to get a little down?
I agree that I would like to do this if it goes to fast-food halls later in the evening relatively early morning.
A couple of pumps, a cola, a burger--and then nothing like home and bed!
However, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco prisoners are noticeable on the road.
Because what has to be wrong if you regularly throw your fast-food boots out of the car window?!
In particular, on weekends, displaced paper supports are located on road shifts and parking spaces.
"Whoo?" I ask myself.
Are people to be baptized to take the chickens home and to the next mill?
It's not just like the paper product is changing the landscape.
Tites have already covered transport facilities such as guidance plans and have solved accidents.
As far as we are concerned, it probably does not even know what this word really means.
If you're off the road by night, just with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after past nights: clamotes, bottles and other furniture are there.
There would be a few more or less toys - in contrast to the street where no one wants to cross the rest of the food.
I can see that the day will come when the cities and communities will be in a state of emergency - and the fast-food chains will have to be searched for their stupid feet.
Obama's return to health policy
In response to severe criticism, President Obama repeatedly repeated his many promises yesterday: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of letters of resignation from their insurer, the Republicans announced to the President in the last days that he had changed the American public.
Yesterday Obama related his original promise.
"The majority of citizens who have a functional health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports to the closures, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look at the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive a better comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than forecasted.
"They're coming up with a better offer," he said.
The Government noted with little surprise that the five percent of the population who have completed their own insurance policy had to be treated at a different rate, since their contract did not conform to the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly: You have earned better," said Sebelius in a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the decomposable Care Act, stated that the start of the online platform has been "miserabel" since October.
"I am just as frustrated and famous as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement of a statement made by Sebelius to a sitting councillor in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with the Republican delegate Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated with the question why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily refused a state-funded insurance to end a tariff at HealthCare.gov that they now want to sell by millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem does not confirm an attack on the Syrian Air Force
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous had claimed on Thursday against the US newsman CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an airport in the Syrian Latakia a day before.
The aim was to be "rockets and associated equipment" from which the Israeli government feared that they were destined for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab Ambassador Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the site of support in the port city of Latakia was attacked on Thursday night of Wednesday, and Israel was responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where Russian retro-reflectors from type S-125 New and a battery of SA-3 rockets were visible, the channel 2 then had a range of 35 kilometers and could transport pump heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertainty The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters also cites an anonymous Israeli government officer with the words that he believes Israel has carried out the attack but is not sure.
A speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said anyway: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground air rockets to the Hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant that a "redline" would mean a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unambiguous agreement that the US spy was “unsuitable to go far”
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected agreement an increase in the United States' divergent attitude towards its monitoring programmes by saying that the spying was “exceedingly too far” in certain cases.
In addition, the Foreign Minister, together with Barack Obama, gave the responsibility to turn on "Autopilot" when the explosive enthusiasts of Whistbleblower Edward Snowden were publicized on the NSA's spy activity.
Through the information provided, the U.S. government has been sentenced to a diplomatic power of the equipment by its allies.
At a video-linked talk at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have been done almost by Autopilot, simply because the ability to achieve what is still going on during the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on 11 September."
As the first high-ranking member of the US government, he then claimed that the US spy had exceeded a limit, but also stressed that rights were not being misused.
He said: "In some cases it is inappropriate to go far."
The President has decided to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is no need to use it.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
Kerry, however, was convinced that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to do it with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is committed to killing people, to blow into the air and to attack governments.
So what if you were able to take it off and stop it before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashs, attacks on buildings and killing people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Under it, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to express their concerns about the alleged American spyage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the United States in the anti-terrorist efforts, as the President of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had talked this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who sits first on the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their doctor on the NSA programmes.
Media reports, the NSA has found millions of telephone data in Europe, have imposed relationships with some U.S. allies, although the Head of Secret Service said this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other explanations were quoted from the documents provided by Snowden, as the NSA has monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 more state officials around the world.
The Head of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spying of allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the morning, Murphy said his authority was preparing for the convention to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members should be published in the following days.
He said the exact route would still be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that some “first words” would be given.
He said that the European governments must be honest with their people about the type of spying programmes they have used for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, these must also be done with the fact that we are not the only ones spying on us," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and to Poland on weekends to exchange with the crowd about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A heartbreaking breach on the spring line is threatening to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga game of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz is devoted to the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train the crew.
Until then, he could only do this on an individual basis.
"We will soon decide on its use," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have the best protection against six encounters.
Because the mains must already rely on the affected performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia's appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she falsely accused her of being raped by a taxi driver, was sentenced to appeal and was released to prison.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false warning after she had told the Thai police that she had been raped by a local taxi driver in the mornings on 10 June, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recording of a video camera showed that she was safe in her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket held Bamford for two days until they were able to figure out the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a port station with low safety levels at the border of Phukets, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has joined the foreign ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks said against the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back to Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the court and is against a bailout of 50,000 yards on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that it was in the middle of the holiday resort in Krabi in South Thailand.
The Court heard that Bamford would be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to higher punishment for adults up to two years in prison.
However, it is also possible for Thailand to try to improve its infected tourist image after the recent murder of the travel purchaser Michelle Smith in Phuket, and that is why it comes to a free speech.
