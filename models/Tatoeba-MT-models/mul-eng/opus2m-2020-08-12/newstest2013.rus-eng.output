Republican strategy against the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justified their policy on the need to combat false elections.
However, the Centre of Brennan is considered to be the last myth, claiming that the cases of fraud in elections in the United States are less than the cases of death from the plague.
At the same time, the Republicans considered only 300 cases of electrical fraud in the United States over a decade.
One can say with confidence that these new trends have a negative impact on voters.
In this sense, such actions have partly depressed the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most governments have adopted laws that have complicated the registration or voting process since 2009.
This event was new following the November 2010 elections, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws limiting the right to vote were adopted for one year in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the elector to provide evidence of identity with photographs and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the duration of the vote, void the right of voter to register the voter on the day of the vote and respect the right of vote to citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State had forced voters to testify to the identity of the photograph.
India became the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in India in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been speeding up this practice in other countries.
For the past two years, they have initiated legislative projects that require electoral candidates to submit their photo-certifications in 34 countries.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such universal identification as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million people who have reached the age of voting, have no evidence of identity with a photograph issued by their government body.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identification is often over $100.
New restrictions have disproportionately affected young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of persons under $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required photo identity.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are believed to be voting for democratic candidates - are not allowed in several states to use photo-based identification.
That is why these same states allow members of fishing and fishing clubs, which vote mainly for the Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
By 2004, no State had required evidence of American citizenship to vote.
The first such requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures are evidently aimed at limiting the vote of the delegates from Latin America.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators initiated laws that allowed voters to register on the day of vote in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction has not gone unnoticed.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a fall of 17 per cent in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of temporary vote.
Thus, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted temporarily were African Americans, although the last were only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was true of those who left Latin America.
Only 11 per cent of voters were represented by 24 per cent of the citizens who voted for a time.
Unlike the whites who formed 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of the voters were elected for a while.
Of course, democratic legislators and their parties are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were pledged by democratic governors.
The most numerous laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney-General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted laws requiring the identification of persons with photographs.
However, the new rules that have entered into force will inevitably make it difficult to exercise the electoral right at the 2012 elections.
Critics of democracies condemned the existence of laws that had been adopted, as they clearly focused on the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Centre of Brennan shows that the States that adopted these laws represented 171 out of 270 votes required in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to believe that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
There is no doubt that these new provisions have a negative impact on voters.
In this sense, such actions have partly depressed the system of American democracy.
Screaming the hand of the front iron: whether to pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives the wrong results, the false, and sometimes the false ones that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so undespaired, have more to doubt.
Whether to pass a test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of violations among the study groups and therefore the data obtained are difficult to interpret and difficult to produce any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality in patients who had gone through screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of exposure to metastases was 30 to 40 per cent higher than those who did not pass through screening.
Therefore, I would recommend a 50-year-old test or 40-year-old if one of the direct relatives had cancer.
Afro-American men are also at high risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
The cancer can be both aggressive and aggressive.
The patient should be informed of the risk of his cancer by offering possible options without compulsory treatment of a simple cancer that does not pose a long-term risk to life, and in these cases, the choice is for the benefit of active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men with cancer will not undergo a course of treatment, since their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more, we clearly define the criteria for decision-making on who should or should not take the course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend that the test be carried out anyway.
However, it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has established an instrument to assess everything and to prevent a PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no cure for cancer.
Despite scientific progress, health care remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that 30 per cent of cancers could be prevented if all people were healthy and active enough.
"If no one had smoked any more, this figure would have increased to at least 50%," emphasized André Bolley, a Canadian press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain unexplained.
For the Canadian Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The surgery is related to 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And this is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to people’s health.
"To date, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said press secretary André Bolly.
The encouraging fact is that within 10 years of refusal of smoking, the risk of death from cancer is reduced by half.
Other
According to CAR data, excess weight and lightness also contribute to the occurrence of disease.
They increase the risk of breast-feeding, fat and direct cough, diet, ice cream, and breast milk.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against the hand of a heavy bag," adds the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities it increases the risk of developing a fatty fluid.
Coal products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by cutting, drying or salting may lead to the education of cancerous substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," explained the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years many scientists have been studying the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
However, the results of these studies cannot be considered as identical at this time.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies produce counterproductive results.
If one of them had shown a reduction in the risk of cancer development, the other had a counterproductive effect.
The impact assessment on the development of vitamin D cancer is also unclear.
However, Mr. Bolío stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family concerns with the doctor.
"The analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last year's report that scientists may have discovered Higgs' bungalow has resulted in this, not without reason.
It is believed that this botanist explains the mass of all parts in the universe, much less.
In addition, it is the last part that was predicted as part of the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "minimum" description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which was not previously able to be discovered by experience.
But physics is not yet convinced that this is about the Higgs Bozo.
We know, without a doubt, that we have a real new part and that it has a strong memory of the Higgs bison, which is predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical conference in Kyoto appear to confirm that some data is not yet sufficient for complete certainty.
Let's just imagine what this is about the Higgs Bozo, as the chances of making mistakes are minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is a law in this world that is absolutely inevitable, which declares that two things cannot happen in the same place at the same time.
You don't have a chance to break this rule, you don't even try too hard, you don't hurt yourself.
However, although the physical nature of the elements is quite strange, it also shows that there is one law of the same nature: the principle of exclusion of Paul, which suggests that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time if they live in the same "quantitary state" -- that is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
From this, physics divides parts into two categories.
On the one hand, we find good citizens called farmers who wisely adhere to Paul’s principle.
On the other hand, there are bozos, a vicious gang of anarchists who have no respect for at least this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place at the same time.
As the site (the most unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories reports, these boons are divided, in turn, into two groups: the zones we are not talking about here, and the "parts of power" through which the main forces of nature are distributed and which in some way belongs to Higgs.
These greatest bozos should be stressed that not all exotic substances as we might think.
In fact, if you can read this timetable, it's due to one incredibly bonfire -- photo, or part of the world -- which is a "curer" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one part having an electric charge is accelerated or changed direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular location, such as a stone rolled in the spring.
From this “conformity” comes an electromagnetic wave (world, or infrared out, or ultraviolet, etc.), which is nothing but a photo, and therefore one of the balloons of “power-saving”.
A more stable field
The same is true of Higgs' bison, with only the difference that for the bungalow to appear, it must be "damaged" another field, Higgs's.
However, the Higgs field is a much more stable electromagnetic field; in order to raise it, it needs to be very and very high energy, as if it were about the frozen spring, whose surface could be only a very large stone.
That's why there's a huge acceleration of particles like those operating in CERN, the Great Adrone Collider, which is a 27-km diameter key! - to achieve such huge energy.
Analogues with electromagnetic fields are also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, work together, others don't. A list of books, for example, will never be placed on a refrigerator.
The same is true, not all parts work together with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photons) do not have it.
So, what can all these studies do, Mrs. Plamondon?
In science they are used to verify the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physics to distinguish between the results of the monitoring and forecasting.
However, some of them desperately wish that such a distinction could be found, i.e. a minor discrepancy could open the door for “new physics” and close some Models doors.
Finally, it must be said that there are still substantial shortcomings, without any explanation for gravity (e!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80 per cent of the universe (e!).
But there were no such differences in CERN.
Consequences
It would be a mistake to assume that such studies are difficult to predict for the everyday life of the average statistical person.
Consider: At the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneer of laser studies in the labs of Belle could not even imagine what a revolution would result from their work.
They provided for their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, a retired physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960 and who developed the first permanent laser (the predecessors of the pulse) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered to be a "laborator's jet".
I don't know.
In addition, the annex can be found for the accompanying study tool.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small world factor during his optical studies in 1969.
Although this was not his original purpose at all, he now serves as a “eye” for all digital cameras of peace and earned the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
That, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Aeronautics would necessarily change our lives, but it simply shows, in fact, that everything can be done.
Palliative help is the best way to die... Long.
The Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec for the merit of death.
The debate must be resumed soon, and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Long tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived in his apartment in Monterey.
The blood of a simple man who destroyed his inside gave him a two-year period.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying on the roof of Victor-Gadbua's palliative care in the White House, where the punishment came from.
"But it's always a shock, it can't be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: an incredible weakness that does not allow to go to the toilet on its own and even to eat on its own.
Sitting behind the table where there is an appetitey meal, it is prepared and agreed to help him eat.
He'll be smart enough to talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medications, take him to the bathroom.
The courage before ordinary death.
"My greatest wish to get rid of the diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for this accident.
"During life we learn that a man must stand up," says Peter Broder, psychologist at Victor Gadbu's reception.
Regression to the child's condition is for some unexplained humiliation.
"Everything depends on man's ability to calm down with a fall," he says.
In the view of many people with palliative care, important events are also taking place at the earliest stage of this fall.
Patients arriving in the Palliative Prison of Victor Gadbua are all sick with cancer.
The projections will take them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing assistance called “medicine”.
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is more likely to die "in the knowledge of the air".
But that's why the disease made me get to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before I allow her to put a mask that makes it easier to breathe.
She still looks forward to her son's last visit from Italy in the near future.
Victor Gadbua is hosted by voluntary groups to care for the body and food aid.
It's also a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative assistance institutions.
It's very small, considering we're all going to die sooner or later.
This life continues under the best conditions that can be explained by Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors.
It's a comfort of physical, emotional or mental.
The dying person will be willing to give his own hand from the brandy or pepsi, even if he asks for it.
Diabetics no longer have to control the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son got this beer in his legs early in the morning.
"We are helping people close to us, as are patients," says Natali Savar, director of care for the sick.
Victor-Gadbua's reception doesn't look like the previous day.
A series of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with the family in the courtyard, sitting on their pillows during the toast, tragically die a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last half of the three to five chickens, always employed by cancer patients up to 45 years of age," Dr. Christian Martel says with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor Gadbua's prison are from home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of sick people at the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
Some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palliative Care Community at the House of the Great Montreal, are more or less specialized in caring for cancer patients.
That is why this huge gap in Quebec ' s health system has led many doctors, palliative care professionals, to fear the adoption of legislation that is legislative and self-sustainment.
From October onwards, the manifesto, signed by the Palliative Care Light, Dr. Balfur Mountain and Dr. Bernard Lappuant and a witness to their disagreement with such an initiative, was circulated.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Quebec health system is insufficiently effective in order to ensure the right to a high-quality palliative care before the transition to Ethanian would be allowed.
Recently, she said, - I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get enough care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients by the end of the day despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hope of survival of Ellen Richard has already been minimal when she has stopped inflammatory chemotherapy.
When I told my uncle that I was stopping my treatment, she replied that I'm sorry I'm stopping the fight, she's telling me.
At that she told me myself that my days are numbered!
No Total Concern
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to medical personnel for not responding to their request after the Palliative Care Team eases their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely essential in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Palliative Care Community at the Home of the Greater Montreal, patients are not able to cope with 8 per cent of the cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often fly to a palliative session where the patient is awaiting his death, whether from time to time or permanently.
I can't believe we don't know about these suffering anymore.
More and more patients who are unable to relieve pain can have access to a palliative session.
The sick who suffer from pain always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get excited," it means "I want it to be easier for me."
The creation of this report was possible through a journalist loan from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
Large-scale scandals with immutableness in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political parties ' funds and Italian mafia experts report daily that they know about a colossal “system” that is under attack by the construction industry, public officials, politicians, trade union workers and mafios.
"Industria", which was very expensive to pay the taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in 1990 and 2000.
"Of course, as this system gets worse after all the money has been spent on it, Jack Duchen, a MP and a former Montreal police chief."
That is why, in 2011, he was shocked by the scandal as a side result of the investigation of police offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, where the Prime Minister of the time, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
The Dushen report established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would retain billions of dollars in contracts," if some had held back their attempts to take part.
The Charbone Commission "has already installed two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "discover individual-made schemes".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was attended by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, with an extensive state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Malot Special Unit, which after 2009 imposed the Montreal Stock Exchange Charter, were to terminate the contract price.
A series of searches have been conducted over the past few weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular France Zampino and Richard Markett, the mayor of a small town, have been accused of fraud and corruption.
On the other hand, Jill Wayyankur, recently retired from the Lavale post, the third largest city in Quebec.
He was suspected of receiving a number of loans in the establishment of public contracts.
In addition, the official charge was filed by several road service engineers in Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The last time I watched this bomb, I studied the "system" of public contracts.
Within a few years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the value of contracts in Montreal to a Mafia-related broker who, in turn, transferred money to the part of Merr. Gerald Tramble "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito spent money on both the right and the left, which included over $88,000 (about 68,000 euros) in various parts of the province, mainly Liberia, which was then owned by the authorities.
He also recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party of Natali Normando.
Cancellation contracts with increased value
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked tirelessly.
Jill Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: within ten years he had received invitations from construction companies to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736,000 in exchange for channelling contracts he had won.
Other road construction officials acknowledged that they had received a fine of 30 to 40 per cent, using false additions.
Then, an organizer from the Mere Party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget filled with party cash.
Following these discoveries, Mr. Tramble withdrew in early November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal who lost their concerns.
The mayor of the Rivier-de-Preri district on the east side of the island has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal property of $5 million and a transfer of... 1.6 million to the construction book.
70 per cent of gross money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in an investigation that would finally be started, she "sends for a net to understand the functioning of a system that covers the walls to stop the gangrene and identify the guilty".
This process is characterized by "sick but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own research team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we get home.
It's regular.
Jak Ducheno notes from his side that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars" but he is particularly concerned about the role of "selective officials who knew about this scheme" but who did not participate in the machines.
Taking into account that the share of money in funding the electoral campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he says: "I was told that this was just a vague reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 for parties, but this does not change the situation: "We will not seriously limit electoral costs, there will be poor money in politics".
He called for the complete restructuring of the State Contracting and the financing system of parties: "We cannot go down; we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story and the darkness on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duscheno calls on those who laugh, to look in their own yard...
"The PSD - not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you've had an unusual break in the PSP.
How would you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual knowledge, but may also be a new measurement of the GSP.
Great games have arrived.
I'll grow up with them every day.
Technical staff also contributed a great deal.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the fight, it's easier.
It's all going on very fast.
But I don't burn.
From the very beginning, I've always made progress in NIF training in Clerfonten and my arrival in St. Stephen.
So you're benefiting from the competition set up by Carlo Angelotty...
The completion of this summer is not in the news of a very high level of football.
They also know that each training is very important.
That's because a game like me wants to be at the level and to be at the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Angelotti has supported my position.
He's been helped by substitutes like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as me.
Anelotti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Anelotti is a source of respect for all technical personnel.
Today he has no equal in the First League and is one of Europe's best coaches.
He had extensive experience, and he won no titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big games.
I think he'll bring new Paris titles.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left the whole series of traumas.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSD season?
At the First League, Leon took us to the lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified in one eighth.
What's the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
It could be all right.
We can say our word to a person with very good European teams.
We began to want to end first in our group, before Porto, so that we could have the opportunity to take the lead in one eighth of the final.
Can the PSI become the first-class European club in a short-term perspective?
He's got a budget for this.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win the title and strengthen its position on a long-term perspective.
It's not like that today.
The CFP has financial means to make this project real.
Don't take the title of the First League as it was last season would be a big mistake?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
In this year we really want to take this campaign title seriously.
Last season we were close to this.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the end first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 eyes.
In general, 79 eggs are supposed to be called a champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that powerful forces such as Marcel, Leon and Bordo have entered the title struggle, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting too much for the PSI?
It's normal to expect a lot of us, taking into account how many games we've played.
We're ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home and we're still at it for what we're critical of, of course, it's a little confusing.
We are asking what people are waiting for.
We will never be able to win every exit from 4 to 0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The command will be formed in time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we can meet the current challenges.
Look at Manchester, United States, who has been unable to spend two seasons in one of the eight finals, even though they have lost a lot of money!
In view of the amounts put in place, we presented you with 15 glasses before the winter break.
This would be a distraction to our opponents and to the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who were not high in the past season, were "deprived" by this new GSP.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can relax and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSC seems to be completely dependent on the movement of the Golden Ibrajimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some "Golden Dependence".
It just means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and he's killing a lot of heads.
He came for this and he proves he's a star of the First League.
The road where he played, he showed that he was a great game and a world-wide star.
In the group we respect him as a human being and as a game.
He also respects those around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
It also stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also encourages all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 from France?
What a disappointment.
I was eager to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma has made me spend a little time playing.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
Today I can play good teammates.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized in Sons.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama in the head of his sons?
They're effective for him.
He has good positions in the team to the World Championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to games and he's inspired to win.
What was Lauren Blan like?
But I don't want to compare.
Blan reached his goal, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will take the children to Brazil.
A well-paid nothing (1-1) born in Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This fighter gave us faith in him.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such fighters in my career.
Payment and sale without bank support - with Bitcoin
Full opposition to the current cash exchange based on the central banks scheduled transactions between the receiving parties (c) of the commissions for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, clearly political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, produced by Satoshi Nakamoto (psenamed), is a virtual currency at the same time (converted into dollar, euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files between participants at one level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand websites take battle to implement donations or as a means of payment.
The rate of battle reached a maximum of $30 (€23) in June 2011, five months after the fall of $2, before returning to around $10 today (the rates indicated on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to the world ' s exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He describes a fighter as "the most successful virtual currency", "competitive with a dollar or euro" and "like usual currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual money, such as "credit" used to move into a video game that is used in the game process or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central authority.
In Bitcon, all the remote networks are simultaneously owned by bookkeepers, auditors, currency brokers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mails, such as e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address so as to ensure anonymity.
The collection of information relating to this transaction shall be signed by electronic means using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, you can check that the battles used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent across the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It is through the mathematical task assigned to computers, which, by means of a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new string.
It's about the phase of file corruption. It's about converting a large file into a digital signature, a short and unique one.
Computers "Bereut" are a new transaction and add a number to it before "heavy" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that gets a unique digital signature (most zero at first).
As soon as this number is found, other strains can easily verify that it's correct.
The transaction is thus inseparably related to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay twice the same amount for fraud (less than ten minutes), only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network, and the other would have remained unconfirmed, as they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 pieces.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is divided regularly into half by the end of 2012.
The number of combatants in treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they divide into one million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with an increase in computing power.
A live network has already survived floods and falls.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked, and fighters were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used is not related to the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paymium, a real-time payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But there is also a lack of money.
Big games, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such sacrifices.
Others, such as the WordPress platform blog, allow them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the University of Wiczman in Israel recently analyzed the account book and found that nearly 80 per cent of the battle men are not in business.
The Giant Sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," John Holmkvist, working in Coinabul, who is involved in the gold conversion of battle men.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this money, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in current money) or a non-cash payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is so out.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's enough to tell the address that can be "photographed and identified" by the phone, explains Pierre Nuaz, confident that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to review hierarchical systems for the benefit of more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turning point," he predicted.
In its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks that are considered today to be higher if this system is successful.
We got out of Afghanistan.
What's up?
The French forces left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capital and Surobies).
NATO and US must follow them at the end of 2014.
It was time for the Afghan army to return control over their territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just ours.
Some of us were suffering mainly from Afghan baptisms that we considered to be terrorists.
And we, with 88 killed soldiers and wounded and wounded.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists who were ex-commissioned in Pakistan, but are also often Christians who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the SSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, so they even join the Jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are patient, sometimes they are helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be the only ones who will be more delicate in the West.
The outbreak of the French forces from the base of Niggerab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted by mandal trees thanks to the French credits, was well under way.
The combat of freighters and spokesmen with helicopters reached Kabul, not being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul.
The circumstances have changed since their inexorable movement from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country was then accepted as their kind of release, return to security.
Afghan women were paid for the blackout of these Christians in which Al-Qaida took them, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The former mejajajajads, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a position of subjection.
The main anti-Soviet war personnel returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers in State-owned lands to sell them under repatriates returned from Iran and Pakistan, using large American subcontracts.
They were disoriented; most of them, however, did not even fight.
People like I've heard in the rural area, however, a government that wouldn't stand out of doors.
Many young people want to see how those who have received an American gift — a large amount of money.
Young people have stood out from war and its ideology.
They lived in today's world when they were expelled from Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are now 5 million people, one fifth of the population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
The workplaces of these young people need to be ensured that they do not want to return to the dark of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed combatants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish military operations that represent modern world and watch everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities that will rule her be considered legitimate?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle have already taken steps to restore provincial mates who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, the mountainous country, with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent by Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, with the removal of the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai did not want foreign control, in particular prior to the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been placed on the feet, no plate has been working, and no irrigation system has been reassembled.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and fruit.
Priority given to private initiatives.
In the country of the Thirty Years of War, public control over infrastructure would be necessary.
It has been heard that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
It just made me feel that Western countries were there just to control them.
No power to transform iron or copper into land, no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no useful waste is obtained.
The Chinese have almost left the med area of Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to discover the vast Buddhist complex and remain the largest workers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations on a beautiful day.
The conclusion of the French Armed Forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance for girls, boys, French-language colleges, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence (Cicic) 'military and civil activities ', which was launched in 2012, together with a small French public organization, have contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in the 10 mountains.
These efforts, with intense involvement of local workers, have helped to keep up: rice, cods, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the soil area.
What do we keep in mind about ourselves, spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local people, which are very severe in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The mission received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works coming from local communities in the province of Capita.
To escape the revolts led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted as they told me, they had to be given a small non-military support that would be well controlled and accessible directly to them.
Heavy species of the Egyptian Constitution
This is the new risk-taking step of President Muhammad Mursey.
While Egypt was more than ever divided on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it emergency powers, it decided to play a wa-bank.
The General Assembly announced that the Assembly would vote on the final text on the following day.
A week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete its work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been based on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only tried to divide the country.
According to his comments, the President insists on its "autocratic level", continuing "to break the word" and "to break the law".
His followers are convinced that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
The short-term view of the fact that Bratislava refuses to explain the text to the Egyptians is article.
It is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy while the country is experiencing a lack of satisfaction.
Muhammad Morsie, it seems to be convinced that the Egyptians are voting positively, as he said in an interview with American weekly Time.
More than that, the urgent call to vote is due to the ultimate Egyptian people: "If you vote for my text, or if I leave myself with emergency powers", which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Ordinance, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberians have not responded to the challenges.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
The same was done by representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 rescue participants were added earlier this morning.
Some are very close to the brothers of Muslims.
It is no wonder that in most cases the article was voted unanimously.
Comments, to be stated, have forgotten the fact that one of the few different days came around... time for prayer, since some members of the Committee felt that the meetings of the Consequences had been wrong.
The text for which yesterday was still voting is contained in articles 234.
Subject to general attention, article 2 in the final outcome remained an identical article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that “sharity principles are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow them to be applied more closely.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for other parties to Egyptian society.
"Lisemery" is the answer to the liberals that only see the beer.
Because they believe that Islam is through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Ashar an advisory role, in particular with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of the Charter.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommie, this is a cause of concern, namely, "people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals, in addition to being inspired by the fact that the next director of this university, seems to be anywhere less important than the present.
"At present there is no specific religious intervention.
From this constitution we remain under civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on this text were not weak, but some people with university education were educated in the French system," says Alex Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “the scope of article 220 may be different, as the terms used in it are derived from religious lexical.
This applies in particular to the "fix" [Islamic jurisdiction, e.g., etc.].
In the future, a question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions on this matter."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticized as it gave the President of the Republic broad authority.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have fallen considerably compared with the old regime.
Second point of dispute: military authority.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will be carried out not in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
The Court will also not be banned from military courts in spite of requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
The responsibility for religion has been maintained, and there has been a ban on harassment that may have serious implications for freedom of speech, especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles no longer mention the protection of women, Heba Moreef, of Human Rights Wotch, emphasizes.
In her view, the only positive moment is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that was not found in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television yesterday evening, the demonstrations were scheduled today in the second half of the day.
The parties to the Heads of State will, in turn, go out on the street on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await sacred places, Pup Earth and the sea from the desert
The Promised Land is surrounded by many Bible truths, modern comfort and the primacy of nature.
Iif has given five of the most important reasons for Israel ' s arrival.
Worship at Holy Place
They are on the other side of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is thought that all those who enter this "cup," will receive God's blessing.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ miracle: turning water into wine into wine, walking by water, healing the sick, and filling the instigation of the nets.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all, Jerusalem is holy.
The believers here are on the Way of Scorpion or the Path of Jesus (Latin – You Doloros).
It begins at the strengthening of Antonia - Pretorium, where the court was held, and on the streets of the Old City, it leads to the Lord's tomb on Mount Golgophe, to the site of Raspitia, the Mount of Anointed Ones and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pop of the earth, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be raised to a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree was grown from which Jesus was baptized.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews — the Mount of Olives, which is left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
By tradition, people from different backgrounds have left notes with desires that are then fulfilled.
To complete a vertical journey
The ruins of Masada’s fortress remained a secret shelter from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on steep slopes in the mountains at a height of 450 metres above the ocean level.
And only those who are attracted to alpineism can do their best to him.
The rest of this historical area is supplied by the canal road.
In the north of the country, 1600-2040 m is a well-known mountain resort in Hermon, where in the winter it is a great tourist attraction.
He's bringing him up from the mountains to get a bus-shutt.
The total length of the tunnel trajectory is 45 km.
According to tradition, at the top of the mountains, gods of language lived.
Visit the Unique Museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip, you're not going to be there.
But even though five of them are most interested, it is worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located just away from Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish wilderness, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
I'm also going to the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
Its exhibitions include a wide range of impressionists and explorists from Mone, Piszarro, Renuara, Sezanna, Syslea, Mattissa, Modillani, Chagala, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which is a few rooms of ancient Turkish baths with visitors and bankers at that time.
In Caesarea is a unique part of the Rallie Museum, where the sculptures of Dale and Roden can be popular.
There are no excursions and no souvenirs.
Income is free of charge, and donations are not categorically accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Vashem in Tel-Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - child memory - is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You get into it - and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are dying.
And they call upon the names of the Jews, and the 'Uzairs, and the 'Uzairs, in which they have died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get well.
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea even in the winter months, water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and air is at 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is even warmer, and it's been bought for a year.
It is the most unregulated sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The saltwater in it is an extract that easily retains water even when it is not able to swim.
The landscape around is really pretty.
They are here to take the course of treatment with salt water, rape, and general disorders, and to treat health at dermatitis, allergic, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchithitis, diabetes, to treat depleted nerves.
Stirred to the Secrets of Old
They will be preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the city of Yafffo on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
This led to the so - called sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromedus from whom they lived for a long and happy life.
Tourists love to be born on the narrow streets called Zodiac signs.
They're saying if you get to the walls on the street with your "your" sign, Fortuna will be a great favor.
In Jaffo it is possible to meet young people from all over Israel and even other countries at the photo session.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - it is possible to build on the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Christians.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A Visit to the Note
Traveling in Israel, do not worry about its imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
Travel money is better spent, not in the euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for coins (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport - mainly by bus, but in Jerusalem there is a fast road, and in Haifa is the only one in the country of a metro line that consists of six stations and connects the lower city with the upper.
In fact, it's a underground funnel.
In all forms of urban transport, there are 6 wheelchairs for which you can drive for 1.5 hours.
The Sabbath was observed in Israel by Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening to Sunday’s sunset, the market, shops, public transport are closed.
And on the morning of the resurrection, the work week begins.
In many coffees, restaurants and hotels, only cook food that excludes pigs, marine products, fish without cactus and blues, where milk is mixed with meat.
There they offer a wide selection of flowers from marina and beef, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various soybeans, cheetahs from a rich nut - foalel, fruit and fruit.
In the streets of the Israelite cities there are no boarding dogs.
That's why there's a lot of dirty cats that really "play themselves."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping on even the corners of the car park.
Murals love human places and do not give up.
The rental of the car, depending on the brand, amounts to $37 per cent (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bus ticket will take place at 15 seconds a day.
The tickets to the museum are on average 30 shekels.
Digit Language
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists around the world.
Most of all, citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine visited.
On the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists arrived, 51 per cent of the same figure in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" brings to Moscow: a copy of the money in the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argued that the law on mandatory language testing had already appeared in the country by smugglers dealing with lip-certificate
Each year, 13 million tourists visit Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of it is Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind.
Since 1 December, a law has been in force which requires every migrant worker to conduct an examination in Russian.
While this rule applies only to those who are intended to work in the field of services, housing, housing and trade.
However, in time - promised in the IMF - tests will become mandatory for all passengers.
This includes not only language but also Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language knowledge must be confirmed to obtain and extend work permits.
Exclusion applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a State language.
The law does not fall within the scope of the law and the people who were able to obtain certificates and diplomas on education until the fall of the CSD in 1991.
Benefits, assurances and protection of rights
The network of examinations will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute of Puškina, the University of People's Friends, IGU, SPBGU and other Russian-language vehicles.
In all cities, there are now more than 160 such centres in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by the House's MPs and the IMF.
And these human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have been able to ask the press a question: what is it?
What will change the obligation of learning the language and for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First of all, responsible representatives of the Migration Service are responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explained the head of the Russian FMS mission in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized collection system will allow 90 per cent of foreign workers to address their problems.
There are problems with migrants without a professional, non-language education without medical training.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev, a future migrant is forced to meet with people who, with the help of his "passion" into a narrow narrow bar where he and his ten like him will be hungry for months without food and documents, spending 12-14 hours in the morning.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They promise their families one thing, and when they come in, they exchange them, pick passports, don't pay the promised salary," confirmed the head of the Head of the Ministry of Labour Migration of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't move, citizen!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who are working in Russia are recognized as not only knowing the language of the country in which they are working but also writing about their own work.
Of course, this is not as much their fault as it is: a few Turks, bears, taks can even get a basic education.
It's not even possible for their families to feed their children, not talking about wearing them pretty clothes, hugging them and going to school.
In the early years, such children were first sent to work.
It's hard, if it's bad language, they admit it.
"You feel humiliated and worthless."
True, with regard to the law on the language of human rights defenders, there is an important point.
The test will be carried out only for migrants who have legal status.
However, if the status does not exist, there will be no examination or follow-up of official work.
In the meantime, most of the hosters still live illegally in Russia.
"It's good to apologize, or the Post Office is banned."
Many of the immigrants claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucracy and all the same language difficulties.
At the same time, the legalization is money: from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And here's a fake record that can be made quickly and entirely for the next six thousand.
The Russian police know that we have no registration, leave and demand in the main false documents.
"Pursue a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," said a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Huschaddev.
"Come on, don't gather, buy the animal book."
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Act, it was made clear that there were not just immigration registration documents.
Several "lipo" language tests certificates have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
Separate books are printed on a typical color printer.
Of course, they have become the new owners of no-one: each of the migrants who had hoped to facilitate the process of testing had paid for a document of seven thousand rubles.
This is twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it calls for three thousand migrant workers.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "steps" could not be simply purchased, matched by authorities and human rights defenders.
As long as authorities can promise hosts who have not been able to pass the test since the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, we will offer jobs in areas that are not supposed to be active with people.
MSD does not engage in the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very small
The Russian Federation proposes to strengthen the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: To find shots at weddings when there was no casualties, and the fight fought by Moscow's lawyer Dmitry Vinograd, which resulted in seven deaths.
Police want to prohibit the wearing of trauma in public places and increase the age from which arms can be licensed - from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the thought-making committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Yarovya and promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced into the Lord in the near future.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “circling the gap”.
There was an open letter on the network that the authors - representatives of various public small organizations - had to reject "unreasonable abuse".
The number of incidents with registered weapons is minimal, the Russian Bi-Bi-Si-Criminalist Vassali Lesnikov said.
According to ISD statistics, 142 crimes were committed in six months of 2012, using firearms registered in domestic bodies, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that increased legislation in the field of civil weapons does not allow the offender to enter the black market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, we can find any weapon at a low price.
At the same time, the MDGs claim that they control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from establishments to officers
The "black" arms market is filled in several channels.
The five main channels are described by Colonel Victor Baranez, who has been working in the Ministry of Education and Geneva for ten years.
The screening site that receives arms orders
The first is "army or military after", which is a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in Kazakhstan.
"The weapons were also loaded with Russian officers, and the prisoners themselves," Baranez says.
The following type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from the representatives of the force structures.
Baranez explains that there are also police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement personnel.
Unlawful goods are sold from military warehouses.
In many military stores, explosions have often occurred.
"There is evidence that part of the fire was made especially to cover the lack," said the former military.
Their flag, Baranca says, is brought by arms producers.
“There are now private arms factories that do not compete on the international market and issue weapons from the field to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert explains.
Another source of "black" market is a smuggler.
There are particularly many guns and cars from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There's its production, sometimes it's expensive, and there's a mafia that organized the stream," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun?
Experts considered what is an approximate proportion of each source of illicit arms supply to the black market.
This report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Planning in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of MDGs and Rosstat, criminal literature and open arms portals.
The overwhelming part of illegal weapons is written by the researchers, from the military and from the authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were presented there “on the basis of officials whose work is related to weapons”, says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the arms cases are caused by armed conflict, 14 per cent by armed robbery, and 5 per cent by black archeology.
The seller-consultant of one of the arms stores who has asked him not to call his family is convinced that the weapon found by black bastards has not been purchased - too old.
Most of all, as he says, the new salesmen go to the military store.
A person buys a unit through a publisher, such as a TT gun.
They're writing it, they're passing it through the locker.
"He'll transport her to town and sell 900 euros here for a piece of two stores," he says.
“Right, the police in all cases, therefore, periodically when the crime disclosure plan is burned, conducts controls on illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"As in the growing store"
The seller and the buyer usually find each other through the famous ones.
I looked at the website, in the blogs, until a friend called out, who offered to come to the "Good" platform, where there would be a man who would bring me into the "golok", where we would trade.
I only knew the price of the beer there.
Mr. Victor Baranez
I need a sign that's out there to get a gun, and the salesman tells me that I have a sign, but I don't believe it.
There are salesmen on the market, but there is also a need to come, provided "from Ivan Ivanovica, who has asked to transfer what he's drunk in the daughter's teeth."
I'm getting a couple of castles now through a man I trust.
He's just giving them to me because he knows I'm not gonna hurt him.
They're looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranez played his role as a procurator of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on it.
The schemes, he said, didn't change.
They gave him an album with photographs where everything was "good."
"I felt like a rose shop," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, Baranca says, doesn't suggest what's in the bag - it's all possible to try.
I, a potential client, don't just buy-- we're going to eat with the seller in the forest, we're gonna put a mouse there.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm sure weapons will be good, we'll start trading," the expert describes the procedure.

Internet searches are made on websites and groups in "Contact", where they offer to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents and personal meetings are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," says a news item on the website "Buy a fight gun or a car."
Its users left their applications and asked questions.
What about the sale of minors?
"No license at all," asked the user Ivan (retained figure).
"TT.Moscow Buy" is a request for Fedorenkov.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of sub-site sites and wants to buy weapons of war by robbery.
People come like a starving fish on the coast and then get caught in Siberia.
Military suspect and former military commander Victor Baranez
I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
A buyer is making payments through a banknote.
"In response, photographs and instructions are sent where arms are banned," said Dmitri Kislov, a press secretary of the public organization entitled "Right to arms".
Victor Baranez argues that if he leaves an application on the site, he can remain free of weapons and go for ransom.

Macros for $100
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, may amount to $100 to $900.
According to Dmitria Kisova from the arms rights organization, the Macarova gun can be purchased for $100-300.
Wait a month.
It is derived from long-term storage stocks by the management of these medium-term stocks.
According to official statistics, the number of crimes in Russia as a whole was reduced by 7 per cent in January 2011 and 22.9 per cent in the number of reported incidents of arms trafficking, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, staff of fastfounds and supermarkets are engaged
Through the MacDonalds case, up to four of all American teenagers are working.
In recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universal corporation and the restaurants of popular fast food networks such as MacDonalds, Burger King, Soco Bell, Wendis and Kentukki Fred Chiken.
Until no one is allowed to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or it will be judged upon early stages.
Actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing low wages for Walmart and fast-food workers, the aim of protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
Until this sector of economics is almost covered by a trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after the Day of Thanking, in the so-called "Black Friday" when the organ of retail sales was destroyed in America by millions of citizens and sometimes accompanied by shocks.
On that day, some members of Walmart’s company, with 2.2 million people working around the world, left their jobs and picked up together with the trade unions and left activists of the corporation’s store, whose goods were considered to be modest and medium-sized.
Walmart sells all over the world, from greens, hot roses and car batteries to powders, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores range from 8 per cent to 27 per cent more than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many underpaid Walmart workers are being retired.
The availability and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow himself to sell the setup goods partly because he will pay his employees less.
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of autoloaders or manual scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday requested a higher salary and established that the cost of the medical insurance provided by the corporation had risen from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
The typical Walmart employee, who received $9.5 per hour, was not on the car.
Researchers at the University of California in Berlin have shown that if Walmart would increase its average salary to $12 per hour, it would amount to $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she's losing her salary right now.
If Walmart is to pay a lot of money on buyers' bills, every visit to the store will be taken up to 46 cents a way.
They're going to spend $12.39 a year more than now.
The parties to Walmart note with satisfaction that protests have taken place in nine states and have not brought any minor damage to corporations.
The Black Friday continued in her shops from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight the next day, and by this time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In general, her catacombs produced nearly 100 million transactions in the Black Friday.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogleman, stated in an interview with Huffington Post on the left, that the workplaces had been abandoned by Walmart's "less than five" staff, and that the protest was the largest "regular pirate trade" organized by her trade union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York where they did not have a Walmart university (which is why they are not here) and MacDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he's selling billions of dollars, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals or pay you for honest work!
Jamin Williams, member of the New York Gorsvot
The minimum wage, under federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase with time, but rarely, and their average staff earn $8.90 per hour in New York.
At least they don't work in this city.
How can there be such money in New York? I don't have enough.
Once through MacDonalds, there were at least four American teenagers who were working for their children after school, living with their parents.
Few have seen this main source of food or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly in an interview with McDonald's workers who complain that they must live on this pay and sometimes even feed on their children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal's forum is a comment that the author notes that it is not responsible for bringing up children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The participants of the protest campaign, which began on Thursday at MacDonalds at the 40th Street and in Madison Avenue on Saturday morning, demanded that cashiers and fast-food systems start to pay at least $15 per hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast food.
The U.S. Act prohibits administration from preventing and punishing activists of the trade union movement by beatings and firings.
On the other hand, administration often makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main factors is the unusual current of personnel.
Inconsistencies
Laughing protests took place on that day and in a number of other banquets in Manhattan.
The event culminated in a meeting at MacDonalds on Wednesday with a number of local Democrats, in which a member of the Gorsvot Jumein Williams, who said "Macdonalds", said that he was selling billions of dollars, and then he didn't even give you hospitals and pay you for honest work!"
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must take a friendly approach to support fast food workers so that they can receive fair wages and economic benefits that each New Yorker deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this was the greatest act of this kind in the history of the Americas of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were rapidly social workers, where tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
Until it's unclear whether it's going to give birth to a real mass movement flame.
"The peace of mind is in the middle."
The popular among modern-day worshippers of technology has recently been adopted to adopt the theme of additional reality through the use of special glasses.
At its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google at the beginning of the summer, and then in November it became known that the application to the relevant patent was submitted by Microsoft.
However, in a discussion with the leader of the 3D interoperable technology group at the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izada, it should be noted that for the company's scientists, the eye is a step forward.
They hold the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with large hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me, in general, what's your research group doing?
- We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but we are trying to break the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind in mass stopped working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes they were punched in their fingers.
We, however, want to look at 5-10 years ago and predict the cardiac changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost one Xbox is not sold today without Kinect, because it's all of a very serious management.
- What else is ahead?
- Despite Kinect's transfer of physical interaction to the physical level, there are many times on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has improved (the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very much.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to get the computer world out of our, physically, to make it more comfortable.
To do so, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And first of all, these stupid pieces of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voting board?
A popular piece, but don't they reevaluate it?
- It certainly cannot be called Panacea - the issue of privacy arises because it does not always want to report its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interactions are good, but everyone in their own minority.
For example, for example, we had a project to manage public facilities, which we thought about the harsh but not the mixed ones, but about such summaries.
In this case, it was not a camera, but a handbrush that was designed to move bones and muscles.
As long as it's big, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of manual hours.
But in general, it's going to be a mixed type of management, such as harsh+voice.
- That's how?
For example, how do you ask me to hand over this gas station to you?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- Is that what you want to force users to adapt to what may or may not be at this point in the car?
- It's not mandatory, but it's a mutual bond.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that will allow for more precise human response.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, they're giving the right depth clearance, it's very important.
If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your claim to modern cameras?
Don't you get permission, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what we can draw from in our work on three-dimensional knowledge.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 at 1000 k/s.
But it's not in megapixels. It's like a matrix and a depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds to the work of algorithm designers.
It must be remembered not only about the X and Y authorization, but also about Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of people per second.
Human movements are dynamic enough, and current 30 k/s are clearly small, especially for fasts.
Steven Bethishes from our Redmond Laboratory has made a regular late-treatment sensor from 1 to 100 ms, with current serial sensors approaching the second (60-100) indicator.
Not all understand how this affects human and machine interaction.
I would like to agree very much with the equivalent of such a device, which is not just a matter of requiring more personnel in a second.
- And the number of cameras doesn't need to be increased?
- In Kinect there are now three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared trigger, and the other one is a receiver of a reflective signal.
And here's the third camera already, of course, the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or deepen it by increasing the required amount of bills.
It would be easy to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the critical availability of cameras and see how this will help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her eyes to the audience.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the everyday use of the extra reality technology of the eye is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very easy, but I think that the harshest option would be a "passing" extra reality if you could switch from your eyes to your smartphone, projection display and further on.
Eyes are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness is an additional reality based on glasses that will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Suppose for a minute that manipulation of virtual GPS objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from "Green Man" but also simple death.
There is one problem that often gives criticism such as no tactical response!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh in terms of human and machine interactions.
I think eight can be added to my feelings of etiquette.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as an appropriate image fitting.
She's doing great. She's registering rape!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving these "air cartridges" -- for example, the interfering of several ultrasound devices at a certain point where the thumb is located -- gives sense, but while it's very weak -- as you've been put on your knees.
There are also bridges that affect nerve endings in your fingers - also a perspective.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels like he should feel something when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried to do that yet.
Here is another challenge that must be faced for a long time - how to impose a man who is physically in a very limited area, to believe that he is going to be open, practically endless - working and on the concepts of escape routes (not at all in clubs), moving platforms and huge fairs.
As long as the brain is in the middle, work is still very much for many years.
This is what works on the virtual reality such an attractive thing for a researcher is a lot of things that are absolutely initial.
A taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt " continues the Peterburgan Vangard project for the people who are ahead in the adventure of culture and art.
This list has already caught the light of Peterburg's art scene, whose achievements are out of the city, often with recognition in Europe, and with universal knowledge.
The new hero Rosbalt is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a man of war dressed in all the beauty he meets at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, in the fashion shops and backyards.
Kirilla Miller's paintings always collect audiences where they don't show up.
Kirill Miller is one of the most powerful figures in Petersburg's socio-philosophic history, the creation of new mifology.
Cyril Miller is the bright man of the Petersburg adventure at the end of the '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
In addition, he was a man of the city by his appearance on the streets of a town that was enthralled by all the building.
He recently took a charm and became a peterburg charmer, as he saw for this complex role all his divine existence, philosophy and image.
- Kiril, why are you going around the city all the way, not in a zeal or a bourgeois, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model that deals with both type and image.
In this world the beautiful color is a compromise between the artist, the painter and the society.
While in society everything that feels no more serious is the result of aggression and the awakening of a bad personality.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
All the stories of my provocation actions are an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize that you should be an artist?
- At a D.C. Nevsco exhibition where my work was held.
I realized it was my way.
Then a wave of old free non-formal artists passed, and new, free types of me were unsatisfied.
I became friends with the artists of a new wave, with a post-tanker that led to "Pushkinsk-10", and there was no more waves.
I'm brushing in the theater, clothes, music, all genres, except words.
And it was all connected to your Art Clinic... and I needed to hear it in the center of Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took up my territory in the Pushkinsk-10, and there was a musical and artistic club, a divine club, a house of the Petersburg god.
Many were born there: NOMI, Tekila-Jaz, I remember how Shnura brought the project "Uho Van Goga".
The sun and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a tight triangle, among them was now fashionable composer Igor Vowwin.
When the team played live, it became Leningrad.
Trattenberg was the lead of many programmes until the Hali-Galitime.
We gave them Tratenberg, and he got a big career, and we got basic education and education.
"D 137" gallery, "Griboed" club, it's just art clinics.
Our workers and all went out there.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the premium was "People of Our City".
In the term "The Year of God" I was named, my colonization was over.
In new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a familiar way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a clear sense of relevance and urgency.
I'm gonna have a program show called the Russian Museum in the cloning.
Clouny is an interim category.
I used to be social, now being that way is painful and terrible.
But in the clones, everything goes down, the tragedy comes down.
I love Grotesque. I have some grotesque ideas.
For example, the preservation of peace through a total transition in a historical order.
Now they're meeting on clothes, focusing on the outside mechanism, not on the inside man.
And maybe he can't give it his hand and he can't swim in the rose.
And the lie will be eliminated with the help of the reconnaissance.
We've seen you in the role of the city charmer recently.
Whoever doesn't like me, they're gonna be.
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Now commercial art must be accurate, tactical, sweet.
There's a culture of disintegration.
People used to fall into rooms, one God loved one another, the other simple.
Now that everything is broken up in the micro-community, it is difficult for everyone to enjoy it.
I'm not a dollar book to enjoy.
Now you need to think about who you're going to like.
Now there are 100 worshipers in each cult hero.
- And Stassa Michelov's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got boobs coming up. There's a sex-social area working.
And 300 people will come on the cultural ground, and 10,000 will not come, and then less management, money, will all go away.
I've got worshippers. I've got them. They're not lying. I don't want to export them.
As a youth, I wrote such pictures as they were on a wall with Falcon and Larion.
I started with a picture that usually ends.
Now they're often misinformed.
They say: a culture of spirituality, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, growing up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money for painting paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this idea: a cultural official.
But not all of them can be cultural.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood much in culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are now good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're busy, just as they need higher experts who properly appreciate these experts and give them a way.
Now it's growing a taste.
The same is true of ERART, but it's different from what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept is that there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's going on with you?
It's not a cultural capital, it's much more in Moscow's culture, there's soil.
And on our stones, it's going to be hard.
We need a cultural soil, and now we have writers more than readers, it's wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who are going to show, concerts.
We've got this thin layer.
We need to make fashionable art as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented by the Grant of Saint Petersburg
Born in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or contact with asteroid killer.
The cargo of spaceships and land on board is shipped to a reserve planet.
In order to preserve humanity, what is the main question of how to continue to be born under the circumstances of ignorance or on the same planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, only two of these planets can be discovered, even if they are hypothetical.
"It is Venera and Mars," says the senior scientist of the State Institute of Astronomy, P.K. Sternberg (GAIsh) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
It's only possible to live at a high altitude or on the orbit of Vener... in space.
Reproductive issues in space began with flowers.
Half past the plant experiments.
Four generations of the city's orbits were nothing different from their land species.
Then, it's the removal of the orbs of crushed, crushed fruit mush-drosophile.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check how embryos develop under conditions of invisibility.
We get an absolutely normal bird out there.
And that's where the problem goes.
"The problem that this bird must find resistance must stand on its feet and start moving," explained RAN Vladimir Síčev, a leading laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
No resistance. Birds didn't do it.
And within 10 hours of birth, there was a complete atrophies of instincts.
Birds didn't react to the world and sound.
And the tragedy was that they just died four hundred days ago.
"And twice we've killed birds, then we've refused because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the loss of an experiment with birds in the space of Vladimir Síčev.
With animals the last time the biological "minique" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The 2013 spring trials will continue.
However, Bion's biopsy will be only one person.
There was an experiment with crosses that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they didn't find anything extraterrestrial there.
"That's how biopsy was, but again and again, it's a single experiment, and such studies have to be conducted," says Vladimir Síčev.
After the earthquake in the space crisis, there was a generation.
However, the problem of proliferation is not directly in space until it is achieved.
It's not a simple task.
The living, the dead, the normal environment of living, they just can't realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thoughts and can create an emotional background.
In ethical terms, such experiments are not conducted.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereschko.
And the most precious thing humans have is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could say if he stayed after flying into space.
She's supposed to have a baby after this flight.
"No one has answered this question," said the veteran of the Wachtang Wachnade.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight to space, the first Cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereskova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of his son, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmos.
In 1988, the second woman, Svetlana Savičko, who lived on the orbit twice and even worked in the open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have a small unit of spacecraft, which has a long flight and a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even for orbital flights," says a spacecraft pilot, Gero of the Soviet Union, Gero of Russia, Valerie Polakov.
Nevertheless, mankind needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaborator is a mandatory flight training phase.
In this case, in the case of zero bluefin tuna, spacecraft is used as an open space.
Water imitates invisibility.
If for adult water, let it and comfort, but it's a strange environment, it's a natural thing for pregnant children.
The little Indians would have confirmed that life on the island came out of the ocean.
There's a connection between being small is about 9 months old in mother's fertility, and then it's easier for her to get used to the water.
In principle, this is reasonable because from the time of birth, from the time of the first purchase, it takes 2 weeks.
"It's very small to forget something," says Marina Axenova, a nurse.
In other words, if pregnancy is more natural for the child born, it is necessary for women to be pregnant, to be pregnant.
The eye is quickly absorbed by the muscles of life, the toes, and the ability to pull fruit.
All right, let's waste this, depending on the incentives for family activities.
Of course, in a special room, she may be able to get rid of it.
"And what further?" asked Valerie Polak.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling earthly tension, the body does not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is not possible to wear an obese, as adults, in a special load suit for training.
He'll just lose what he needs.
"And this experiment that we are going to go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to the land of a completely detached human being," said the head of the IMP Committee on Bioethics RAN Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
However, it will soon become reality when the land on its ships goes to a distant planet, which will become home for their offspring born in space.
Head of the Chief Audit Management: Check of the sugar system has been broken by policy.
In the government procurement sector, Czechia has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, remains in force.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Management Board, from an interview for the website Atualná.cz.
"The law will never be ideal, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough for us," Kala commented.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of Czech and German authorities.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter Nechasa's approach to the so-called drought system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not worry about the verifiers - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be in any way established, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions capable of checking and carrying out obligations,” Kala observes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the law on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was this about?
There's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply speaking, that European legislation states how public procurement should be carried out, national legislation should be followed and then applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even in the course of an inexhaustible verification, there were interesting differences. It was easy to say that we could be "right and fair" by law, but in practice we are in Germany on some of the parameters.
It should therefore be necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you what it means to you?
That is why such joint control can contribute to efforts to stop legislation from clarifying, reducing and improving restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid harassment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this, reducing restrictions.
This system may be filled with "bumama" so that those who want to find lasers in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our CRU (Controlal Audit Management) or is it working differently?
With regard to institutions, there is also the Bundesrechungshof, which is based on our principle, and there is a college that works a little bit differently, but in particular both institutions work similarly.
Moreover, the powers to a certain extent are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal land units - in this system they are quite different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounts.
What about local law, that's easier than we have?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some cases for Germany, it can be taken as an example, but I cannot say specifically that it is best for all.
That's because they're doing better with control?
Of course not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how has the effect of the amendment to the Public Procurement Act been affected?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has never been in our control work.
As we control the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the preparation of future checks - we started using our new instrument "risk recovery", through which we passed almost 14,000 public contracts.
What do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or add weight to the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are "fashioned" and cannot be complied with.
In the implementation of previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with public procurement law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it possible to use the law in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to be arrested and abused but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do you get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path will never lead to anything.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GDP will not worry about the company's inspections of the so-called drought system. What does that mean?
"Swartz-system" banned or allowed?
The law should be in some way established, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister may not oppose the work of bodies capable of checking and carrying out obligations.
You can say, "We change this law and let it go," but we can't say that we're going to pretend that nothing is going to happen.
The Public Procurement Act contains sufficiently strict rules as well as formal and correct, which will protect public procurement.
On the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal is disabled only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough for us.
Roads are smooth, but they're mainly going through.
In some places the roads are frozen and frozen.
They're mostly going through, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovar
This morning in Karlovar's end, the roads were traversed, but somewhere frozen and frozen.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should be at least warm.
Snowfall in the region has ceased, only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, it is about 30 inches [30 cm] of snow on the slopes of the Red Mountains.
The information received from road workers in the area showed that the places were less visible due to traffic.
The speed six R6 and the roads of the first class in the region are currently unlimited.
However, caution is needed, for example, at bridges where surfaces can be narrow and narrow.
All roads related to the second and third classes, including mountain slopes, are also transit.
But in some parts of them, the remains of frozen and frozen snow are still in place.
It is particularly important to be on the roads at the peaks.
The Pardubic and the King's End
The Czech road and highway management on its web pages informs that some of the roads in eastern Chechnya are threatened with hunger, while on the mountain roads and roads located on the tops of the mountains there may be a snowy layer.
Road workers warn drivers of hunger, which can be particularly educated in the mountains of the Pardubic region.
The cold can be around Lanscrounna, Usti-nad-Orlici, Polici, Svitavi or High-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Switzerland are processed by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the streets of Crkonose and Orlic Mountains.
The snow layer is located on the roads located at the peaks of the Rhine-West and Trutnov areas.
In East Chechnya today, the climate is changing without crops.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plenary
Roads in the Plenary are going on this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, temperatures are about three to nine degrees Fahrenheit [- nine ° C].
After snowfall and subsequent freezing in some places, it can be cold.
Leaders may face obstacles, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by road workers.
Six D5 is now practically unlimited, but road managers recommend that you be cautious between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first class roads have dry and dry surfaces.
In the south of Plyzni and Takhwe can fall into the ground.
The paths of the second and third classes are smooth, and in this case there is also a warning of the possibility of the presence of wheelchairs.
Leaders should be careful, especially on a few roads in the Shumawa region.
Olomocyk region
Leaders heading up the Olomowice border must take into account the snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea and on the road towards the Video Cross.
On the night of the snowfall, it was forced to travel by road workers, according to road management information, to land about three centimetres of snow in Schamperke.
In other areas, the end of the road is usually not limited.
"On the top of the shampoo lies the rest of the snow.
Leaders on the Essenica side must be in the presence of a snow casket at the Red Sea," CHAN (Chestic News Agency) reported today.
On the night of road clearance, their colleagues from Essenica were also convinced that the roads to the tops after the treatment remained large and soft.
There are no restrictions on the road in Olomatica, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful in forest areas where they are still in the state of play.
Instinctive End, in Liberia
This morning road workers from Northern God report that there are a few difficult crossings.
According to information from the police database, in addition to a number of cold or snowy places, the mountain road is closed from Telnica to the clinic in Ustetzko.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lows, so the roads remain snow and ice. In the lower part of the south-east of the Czech Republic, especially in the middle of the Middle East, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Road difficulties have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the occurrence of hunger in the vicinity of the State.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for his education were created at night, all day long the rain and the shadow of the snow, the night sky became clear and the ice began.
It is reported that the adverse conditions on the main axis and on the I/13 traverse are reported on the Usteck and Liberian border.
As a result of the snow falling down on the trees of the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnica to the Book.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want to capture positive energy
What do you think that less than a month should be the end of the world?
It's just one of the many worrying news that we humans are so easily falling on.
Together with The Tap Tap group we are constantly on this issue and say that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to slow down or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you're going to give absolutely exclusive three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell us more about these readers?
This is a public fund-raising event that we have been planning here for two years.
We decided to use the marketing capacity that holds the May calendar, which ended on 21 December at 11:10.
By 20 December, three concerts were held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They end up with a rough speech at the time when the lunar calendar is completed on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who's in charge of this idea?
That was my idea, and we were all thinking together with our artist, Gonz Augusto.
In addition to our desire to capture enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world we will once and for all about our children.
At the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus provide us with support.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, also performed a gymnasium against the end of the world called "The End of the World Is Disappearing".
Will the favorite YouTube audiences ever be able to play these charity concerts?
Of course, in the end, if everything comes to an end and the end of the world doesn't come.
All performers are invited to all concerts at the same time.
At the same time, they are also called in the direct ephemeral of Czech television.
The words of this song were written and played by Jesus at Thomas Gangak, also involved in the execution of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also work with other people in Czech cultural life, as we perform many charitable activities and concerts.
We are working hard to involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many enjoy working with us, and they were interested in us.
What's going on from the concert against the end of the world?
In order to buy equipment for the free educational center of STUDEO, we have been working with the Tap Civil Association in the Edlica Institute for the sixth year.
Teachers regularly visit students at the School of Edlici and conduct enjoyable and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
Within the project of further construction of the Edlica Institute, a separate building will arise in the future, in which we will be moving with this project.
A number of musical groups and performers will be present at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to establish a programme that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague there are Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratrapere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
Both details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "grand activities" in the future?
In May we will first address the Spring Spring Festival and, of course, prepare an interesting program with interested guests.
The next year we would like to introduce ourselves to the Czech national home in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago personally if we were in the United States.
From the border you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you deal with the road from the point of view of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems to be at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their bikes should travel in the luggage department, plus the largest number of cargoes and tools.
The Czech ČSA planes and the British British Airways have always been extremely well prepared for us to see how many times I've been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we've been back recently, it's been all right.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you been up to right now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have been witnessing that in the east there is still at the base level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still a movement of people on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there are no banal items such as access to the path of the disabled to the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw attention to people ' s problems with limited opportunities.
On the other hand, what should we always have to do with prosperous countries?
There's a lot of stuff, the level of implementation that's far behind.
It is important, however, to clarify that improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it's perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to move on the streets, they can go to a toilet, a museum, where they can...
It is not very widespread that a large number of people with limited opportunities take an active part in public life, and we have little control over them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for society or impartiality is one thing, but at the moment that famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or jurists appear among us, everything will really change.
As long as it's one case, people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but we'll be back two years ago, which has forced you to organize it in 1998?
I went to Edlica's Institute as an educator, and there were many young people around me who wanted something to do.
And since I'm a musician and I'm playing in and out of the saxophone, I organized an interesting musical course together with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our lead Lady Angelovich says, it's a little out of control. (Laughter)
Well, popularity has only come in recent years, or am I doing something?
This is true, it has helped us to start joining the famous singers and to work actively on the advocacy group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess is in fact out of existence.
Through the means of the European Union, we can make ourselves available to qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal to play The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their ability to do something unusual.
In Shaw's business, there's a lot of stuff that's up to each other.
That's logical, it's all taken care of, and it's been a long time.
There are very few things, but I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression on the man who sees us, of course, is sad, it's natural...
But this regret is extremely extreme because people with limited opportunities are not suffering, and all the people we have to complain about.
They are people who can live and develop fully, of course, only if they have the resources they need.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's a move not only for them but for society as a whole.
Has it been a success that you're a strict leader, what do many think?
If we want to do a good job, we must be in many things uncompromising and hold to a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic introduction and fly into the clouds, and when they know that they should go to the rehearsals twice a week, visit the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap Tap is currently composed of twenty people.
How many did they start in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We open a group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of their will, our doors are always open.
It will be held on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 2 p.m. until the expected end of the world.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, in Brno - Fléda and Ostrava Club - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of the 12th group and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by televiso at the time of the performance of the song group The Tap Tap Tap "The End of the World Is Disappearing".
The purpose of the project is to collect funding of 25 million dollars for the purchase of multifunctional non-skilled equipment for the educational centre of STUDEO at the Institute of Edlicica in Prague.
The ticket for the concert is 400 kroner for children up to 12 years of age. Tickets can be bought early in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the second member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former East block (after Chechia, which became a full member of ECA on 12 September 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and had participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to space began a long time ago.
Prior to World War II, Polish enthusiasm was involved in space voyages, but this was not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture A. Sternfeld, which was presented on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw astronomical Observatory for the idea of its innovative work "Introduction into space".
The ideas of a young engineer (1905 C.E.) left the hearing room, and after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won Robert Estona Peltri's prize in France and André Luis Hirsch for the "Introduction to Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major advocate of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Guam became known as the world promoter of spacecraft, and its contribution was appreciated, including that one of the craters on the other side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 a railway line was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as was the case with the details of the project.
It was not even clear that rockets should have been used for the purpose of spreading or braking the body.
This girl's information is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about rockets.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Metmir Wolfke and Gustav Mokjick.
It is evident from the material preserved that studies have come to the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric rocket that was proposed by the Rogozinian engineer appeared in a special print, and the following year the work of Lelivi-Kjivoblock's author was launched.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Prior to the war itself, all projects of military use of rocket technology were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Timedczo-Sakowy Committee), which coordinated all work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but two years later its work was completed because of the beginning of the war.
The following scientific work on outer space appeared in post-war Polish press, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Tovarizstwo Astronautique).
The first on society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of The Problems magazine, which publishes four extensive articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Sobotovic proposed that a spacecraft society be organized.
At the time, art satellite projects had already been traded, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since 1956 the Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and has already become an active member of the OPA.
The following year, the first POA President, Kazimez Zarankevic (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that position until his death, which took place in 1959.
Since 1956 POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful Meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which has become the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and two-pronged RM-2 rocket tests were conducted in the Bled field in 1959.
This rocket was about eight feet [1.4 m] long and its weight was about five pounds [1.5 kg].
The following version of the rocket was already in a position to carry out this scientific work: RM-34 could exceed 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type rocket has become the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was thought to be two-dimensional, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (named Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C), which were different from the size of the scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a range of 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 L and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum flight distance for all three types was 37 km.
During the period 1965-68, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first summer trials began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with an initial weight of 380 kg was capable of delivering a useful cargo of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It also mentions the introduction of Poland into the COPAR (Committee on Space Studies) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COPAR two years later.
In addition, under the Intercomos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet art satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermesevsky became the second intercommanate after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The decision led to a lively discussion in society.
There is no doubt that it will be interesting to consider this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of a multi-legislative, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free movement of private capital, together with the unencumbered financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labour (remuneration) there is a price pressure.
In this regard, it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer tries to demonstrate in economic competition that the price of the competitor is “increasing” in order to absorb most of the market and thereby increase its own income.
To a large extent, this means that the majority of entrepreneurs or the transfer of products abroad, or the purchases of goods abroad, or disappearances, result in increased unemployment in countries where the value of labour is higher than others.
As private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for unemployment, it will increase the inevitable costs of States for social needs.
In general, the situation is compounded by the unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the public economic and social damage suffered by them in return.
The situation is so well known that specific statistics do not need to be provided.
Non-core private capital approaches create at the level of the economies of individual States when Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their people with a view to attracting foreign capital.
In other words, Governments give their own people free of private capital, despite social losses.
This is reflected above all in the changes in existing legislation.
The goal is to make their people financially vulnerable to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as an economic pressure system in the case of long-term unemployment and serves as a tool for the reduction of workers ' rights in labour law.
As a result, poverty is rising, while the gap between the poor and the rich is widening.
In the FRG there has been a number of years of public spending on poor products that cannot be attributed to their own efforts.
The number of these people has already reached a million.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases where employed persons receive such compensation that the State must pay them in order to obtain a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has become known to the public and in the case of additional Bundestaga workers.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic social situation are forced or forced to immigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to live on poverty pay on the social dividends in hopes that private investment will ever come into the country.
But where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, such as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African, and European employees.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and media of mass information before it is clear that the State cannot participate in its own economy, which leads to economic disaster.
Part-capital insisted that the State should not engage in economic management.
Should we continue to answer the question of whether private capital is currently in operation, whether it is currently practically managed policy and whether it is in the same general state for its own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of practically all possible and inviolable lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have an inexhaustible situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where punishment is practically deserved, but is not a crime.
In the case of the FRG, public ministries, due to lack of financial resources, are entrusted with the development of laws to private legal firms which are closely related to industry.
These draft laws are then adopted by the Bundestag.
All authority is not from the peoples, as is the constitution of the Western type, but from financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now taking place rapidly in a situation like that described by the Appian in the "Crisse of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The State is already in a state of disintegration and the public is in violence.
Acquisitions, illegal receipt of mercy through stones and swords.
Retirement and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with the previously sold vote" ...right people did not even vote for the government, at the end of the first eight months of the state remained unconsulted. ... ... ... ... ... ...to begin with saying that the only rescue in this terrible situation is self-government and the need for a man of power.".
As in the past, the present society has its own unreasonably unwarranted interests without regard to public interests.
The share capital is no longer intended for public use.
The current outcome is not different from the past: an unprecedented fall of elite without any effort to undertake a deeper reform.
So we must look for the root causes of the rise of the Fascist and Communist regimes in the unwarranted liberalisation of economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be seen as a certain break, followed by the next tour.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the impact of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are now experiencing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision or at least not always.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The decision is the objective political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s low participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Haosa Laboratory.
"There's nothing out of violence, and there's no way out," says Sting, the song "Bruddy," where the main word is "we don't forget what we're broken."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have been," said the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meera Amchel Rotsilda.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has always caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians by arguing that it is the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is credited with the role of the State of terrorism.
I do not want to think of who is a criminal in these periodically repeated massacres and who is the victim, at the end of the day, of Israel's citizens, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation and were not witnesses of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the burden and to look at those who have been serving for 95 years (in view of the signature of the Balfura Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people are the main drivers of modern history.
Human history is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is that these people have always taken their own steps, or they have been driven by someone who has directed them to their previous goals.
It should be admitted that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people, and that this concentration of money and the procuring power could not exist for one generation.
Among the highly wealthy families is one that could be considered as the head of the fleet (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but it's not excluded) Rotschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop hearings related to criminal activities in the high-level areas in which they were, and which were always meant to strengthen their power, increase wealth or simultaneously, and so on.
They have large shares packages in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in which they do not have their share, they are carrying out or preparing for war (before entering Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after entering Iraq, only four countries were left after the Qaddafi invasion, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of their country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the Central Bank for the Rotschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (concealed) money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System) in 1963.
Their desire for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great mass of 33rd level Albert Pikem.
The objective of the first war was to destroy the monarchy in Europe, the second to destroy colonial sovereignty, particularly the United Kingdom, and the third to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be sufficient to provide comfort and growth, and they would not spend much of their resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecomenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the ultimate acquisition of absolute authority.
The method by which a group of the richest families is working with the Rotsildas is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal for solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see FED, which had to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to link the first world war through the murder of the Habsburg Austro-Vengerary heir of the Fendinanda throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia and began a multi-violence revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, which was not based on German military and economic capitalization (the need for war to destroy Russia) and, as a result, the expansion of the Central European State, Austria.
In order to facilitate the development of World War II, banks and policies have created a hidden conflict situation by putting great war reparations on Germany rather than prejudging the radicalization of the combined mass, then only to abandon Germany enough strong, seemingly innocent and simple decisions of the Leader, further to create a multi-national Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to be played, and actually played the role of the fifth column, at the fire of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotchyldi promoted the foundation of Zionist movement, one of which was aimed at establishing a Jewish State, which was willing to establish historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned declaration by Balfura created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first talks with the local Arab population began to take place.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
The Second World War has made it difficult to assess if Hitler has fallen out of the pockets in which he has been held by banks, or whatever he has done, it has been planned that in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created opportunities for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany was forced by war reparations in World War II, the State of Israel was declared to be the face of a third war.
If international banks can connect it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will become victims of war on the front line, now with the Arab or, in short, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is a truly giant laboratory, a source of division and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (only to take a sharp distinction between the parties and Israel's opponents).
Who is responsible and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the attempt results in an ongoing wave of violence if it all starts with the desire of individuals and their efforts to the world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, international banks are recruiting people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel ' s passion for Netanyihu is a typical example of a Fascist, loyal international banker's policy to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to rise in the world conflict and, taking into account Iran ' s control over the 20 per cent of all world oil stocks (the shipping corridor is only 2 million miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockweller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new order of the world in which they present themselves is the world of the Lord and the slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves as the cornerstone of a financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where each birth-born organism is implemented by chips with which it becomes a substance under universal control.
“And he will cause all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slave-servants to have on their right hand or on their left, so that a man who is not known by the name of the beast or by the number of his name may not be able to buy or sell.
Here's what wisdom is: Everyone who has the mind can count the number of the animals.
Because that's a human name, and that's six hundred sixty-six.
The Argo Operation: When it's over, call Hollywood.
In November 1979 a crowd of Islamic student demonstrators seized the United States Mission in Tehran and took 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the confused march of Mohammed Reza Pekhlevi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the guardian of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect a positive outcome of the situation - it could not allow itself to land on board because this could undermine the trust of the Unions in other countries.
However, the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
This was an attack on the United States' prestige, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages.
Prisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days following negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their trial brought about a wave of solidarity and anti-cipatory attitudes at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat at the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with Ronald Regan's election.
A film organized by an actor by Ben Afflict The Argo Operation describes one of the episodes of American history that has led to small victories.
Not long before the occupation of the six staff members, six were able to escape.
After the difficulties, they ended their way into the residence of Canada's mission.
The CDC, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to remove them from Iran, thereby helping to provide an extravagance of cover that they have come from Canada ' s passports as members of a group of homosexuals who have spent time in the country for the summaries of the science and fantasy era.
Genres Association
The plan that the "evacuation" expert, Tony Mendez, has requested Gollivuda's cooperation.
In order to make the legend credible, the specialized journals described the draft film, the press conferences were held, and the thought-making company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept in secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendes's memoirs.
The film Affleka is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, called a movie cinema, a story of a successful career, may be a series of films about Ouschen's friends.
The film has always changed attitudes - on the one hand, documentally imagined scenes from Tehran (the titles show the historical photographs of events and how the same situations have been shown in the film - are not very different).
On the other hand, the relief of Goliath wastes from ironic and moderate overcrowding.
And then the scenes from the CRU headquarters and other institutions -- men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating table, on the premises, on the phone...
Ben Affleku was able to make a career restaurant.
From the mixed actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be an object of ridicule.
Argo's third full-time film, following the dark detective "Shit, Child, Forgive" (2007) and "Gorod" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film of Afflek, which is not filmed in the home city of the director of Boston.
The sense of space is related to the quality of the previous film of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And it's shown in Argo, where Tegeran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are being reconstructed, the opening scenes of the mission's fall are impressed by its clarity, which also gives rise to the emotions of travel and uncertainty that arise when history is suddenly changing.
Similar effects are achieved by Afflict and his colleagues in the eyes of the mind (partial headquarters on the Tegeran base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to be responsible for the fact that the event did not prejudge the number of scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's been successful enough to work with these few people, sometimes something to think about - that's all not so elegant (a scene where a phone call in America prevents an overcrowding crisis at Tegeran Airport, and the rides on the windshield field look pretty clever).
The lack of "Argo " is a disillusionment associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really very helpful in the role of Hollywood colleagues, but their personnel would earn more space, and they were not the only ones in the film.
Affleka's film does not cover some dramaism, which can be viewed with a moderate interest by assessing the order and retro-style that generates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard.
This, however, is sufficient to remind you of one, still in the sense of living history, as well as to show how the representations of the most powerful and knowledgeable services have been exceeded.
Airways, bananas and circus rules
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducting an annual review of the most absurd bank collections, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or project from the EU".
"We have been moved to this last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said Dr. Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights to bring together insurance contributions for men and women has already been made on the nomination of absurdities.
Women were still benefiting from life insurance because they were objectively less likely for insurance companies.
"The further incredible ideas from the master EU can lead people to the competition by the end of this year.
Only the vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's opposition concerns, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomputers to fuel, which results in damage to nature, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable welders only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the directive on the size of the sugar cell, which has caused significant increases in eggs this year.
Critics have also been effectively prohibited from using the term "butterboard oil" or removal from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas shall be 14 cm long.
A common European apparatus is often decided by pressure from any other trade or industrial lobby, which in Brussels is usually protected by any State or group of States (which is why Chechnya is now under threat even under the obligation of its banks).
The interests of lobbying are such as, for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not be allowed to show "anomaly" crime.
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by harmonizing only the existing different national rules that were difficult to deal with.
In spite of the opposition of some States, the EU has simplified the standards of fruit and vegetables, bearing in mind that existing directives will lead to the elimination of products.
A winning candidate may also become a previous EU regulation, which requires that aircharists be obliged to warn that children under eight years of age cannot be forced to drive them without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to U.S. studies in which the air currents in the game are the potential cause of death of children by breathing.
Such restrictions are now extended to children up to 14 years of age who are forbidden to smoke in broccoli.
Fun ideas are born at home
There is also a rather absurd rule regarding European officials: everyone who has any official office in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in the light of the delicateness of the subject for Greece, and should instead say "BURM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists of the Principles of Non-Interference (Laissez Faire), proposed for the vote, in addition to several of the abovementioned absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established a maximum amount of food stocks which may be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the EU.
In time, Chechia increased, for example, the amount of preserved waste that threatened her with a large fine.
The questionnaire ' s organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries what they did not have at sea and the idea of granting subsidies to a grant claim.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not Brussels.
"We're in a bad situation because we don't have a sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said the Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CSDP) in August 2004.
As an argument, he indicated that there was a high seed crop in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stocks of stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Pallas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission went to the meeting of the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of seeds from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grants for grant were offered by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular by the Ministry of Regional Development, which had to make a statement on the grant from Brussels.
EU: Wonderful provisions are an exception
While decision-making in Member States is easy to be critical, EU regulatory efforts, as well as more effective functioning and development of the EU, are, in the opinion of many experts, more readily recognized.
A serious problem, experts believe, is that the EU's contribution to projects which have no intention of even deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved during the budget debate.
The Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, which it does not always win at this meeting.
Although six years after the Czechs fought against Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoukki markets" was preserved, but "Tuzem Roma" was the tradition of 19th-century roots in our country, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzek".
It can be called rome only products from polyethylene rather than sugar.
The official list of EU-registered products, together with the world-wide "feta" and "gorgondzole", marcipan from the German Lubek or Parmese, has already been shown, for example, carlovar sugars, confectionery and wheat flour.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of the Pardubic tube and the wooden tube.
People want me to keep the Republic, but I'm a lover, says Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come into the head of the president's position?
I don't think I'm going to be a senator or president.
If we had everything worked out in our country without any problems, I would never have been balsaming.
But I can no longer see how countries have been developing over the past 20 years, how the doors are being opened, people are increasing taxes and pension age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution to change it.
And since I've been married for forty years and I'm an independent person who doesn't belong to any party, I have no choice but to vote for a senator or president.
You fell into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Will you not then turn away from the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I would be involved in the fight against the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the elections in Senate.
Later I explained that if I was elected by the senator, I would vote in the president's office.
My goal is not a post, a post is an instrument I can use to carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and widest powers.
But the challenge is not only that we as a nation have a lot of money in the bar or television, but we are willing to break up with anyone who tries to change something.
To that end, the media are added, which people turn away, and which lead to freedom of speech with lies.
For example, I was told that I'm going to give the reporters a loan or that I'm an adviser to Irji Paroubeka.
Let's go back to your views.
You started fighting the presidential castle with the emphasis on the material and criminal responsibility of policies and the return of property statements of more than twenty million.
In order to do so, it is necessary to amend the law.
You do not have such powers as the President, and only the whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen struggled to make the trip into a free enterprise, this could be furthered.
The problem lies in politics - when someone comes up with a good offer to the left or to the right, he is mindless, and that keeps the citizens from doing so.
As an independent neutral person, I have much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentarian parties.
My advantage is that I can take on every party what is best for our country, and apply it without party planning.
Do you think you're a man more related to the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people are going to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
I think it's important for us to move forward.
It's not about someone who's right, but someone who's left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good for society to decide whether I will offer it to CPCM or GDP, and I will do the same against the bad idea.
You're wrong when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove that what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
This can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world or are addressed by visible experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only be left with your sins.
And you won't be long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will have criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to change them on our own so that we can get our own.
If I had been elected as President, there would have been no problem in organizing a direct television transmission, in which I would call on the Presidents of Parliament's parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for policies, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they do not want to.
If there is a strong personality that is a source of abuse, political pressure can be put on the scene.
Take the President's direct elections -- that was a favour of pressure from the public.
I'm telling you, I'm a lover, not a genius, and I'm not intellectual.
I'm trying to look for allies to break my beliefs and views.
I'm just starting in politics, and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I am trying to move on by myself; in case this is not done, I will return to the private sector after six years.
This will sometimes sound like Ocamura's supposed to save Chechnya.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything, so I'm wearing a couple of famous people with a proposal to go to the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, and he gave up much work.
At the same time, I have also supported the leading investigation by journalist Jan Lorenz, who has discovered fraud with light fuel products.
I've made my application because people are not really satisfied, but now I feel I'm in debt.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but most of those who went to the polls were elected representatives.
Only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be made with effort.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, on direct elections of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about this yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential party in the past, and I don't have money for it.
There's no money in the presidential campaign, in my transparent account, only 20 grand.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property statements, and how are your own cases going on with this?
Personal property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, a 10 million room, another 8 million room, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin, 3.5 million and Scotland Superb per million, and a few million more on account.
Aston Martin's hair turned out to me because it was my little dream. I always liked James Bond, who was riding on the car, was a galanton with women, and at the same time fought against substantiation and illegality.
You eat at Aston Martine, you own 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors is evidence that my programme is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for my pre-election campaign.
The cost of my campaign is actually going to cover the senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live on these money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that is worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't have been balsaming.
So you're going to take on a business so you can live?
Didn't you say you're reducing this activity?
But that doesn't depend on the amount of pay.
As I promised, I gradually reduced my activity.
For example, the director of the tourism agency will become my deputy.
People would like me to be a freeman who will preserve the Republic.
But I also need something to live for.
How much as an entrepreneur you used to get each month?
From twenty to four thousand, which I still get.
And if I were to be president, my business would end.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's issue of "Right".
The MVRDV architects prove that these conclusions are not just imaginary - for example, Spain and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and we can finally see something interesting again," said Lizete Verghig, walking along the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a large business neighborhood, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: ‘ Why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is now willing to go to such old - fashioned libraries, is it?
Spain, a small red city under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to combat this embarrassing situation, it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven mindless bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of life-changing miniatures from Jeresobeton.
The success of this education initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only chance of getting rid of the statistics — to build a library here!
The Maas wines from the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, the master of strong pillars and the author of sharp, sometimes even cynical constructions, were focused on the challenge of its normal inconsistencies and appeared in a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and face.
As soon as the jury members looked at and touched their plates, the Dutch Maas made a pyramid of its original gift and concluded with the following words: "The considered citizens!"
Here's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spain, so called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain has grown to a value of 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, mail and a number of residential houses and tonhauses in a total capacity of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the "Booking Mountains" was noted in the second prize competition "Good Netherlands Library of 2012".
The project also participates in the Dutch national competition for timber weapons in 2012.
Thus, the endless opportunity that had previously been offered to nothing but a post-modern walking zone and a surprisingly unpretentious rattuce, the white phases of which are based on the mind of the molluscs, became a treasure for one modern architecture.
But most importantly, in Spain there was the first public building in the history of this city.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: Eldorado's book under the cover for cheese.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain mass, because these worshippers of architecture and readings would prefer to study this place by foot.
Scattered by all sides, a light and easy-to-view room, a field from the skyline and elegant street faons are undoubtedly creating a sense of the public area.
The urban environment is perfectly up-to-date.
They're looking for shoes, dogs and toys in boys' and girls' football.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
“The bookstores are usually behind the scenes, and there is a large dark room in the middle, usually empty and empty,” says Vini Maas.
We put a classic space configuration on our head and we pulled out the area to read the inside.
The interior of the mountain is used skillfully: offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities are located in the center.
In particular, the black bookstores that serve that section of the wall, the parapets, and the woodpeckers.
They're kind, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tested architects and engineers are lost in the roofs, which is an unknown material.
"We have tried to work with secondary materials," explains Job Traublast, project manager representing the Spanish community, as required by the standard.
And we once met an appropriate agricultural side product at a farm in Frisland.
It has been in the temperatures and fields of the Netherlands for many years as a bottom-up surface of artificial woolen material of millimetre density.
It's a waste of time and economics.
The tonky textile is served for one or two seasons, then it can be extracted.
For libraries, this was completely -- first in such amounts -- put into the empty panel of four centimetres.
Under fire and pressure, the so-called Landbauplast (KLP) is turned into a dark, unique, solid material, with a little memory of a new car and a little cross.
They're at the top 105 degrees.
The person who passes a distance of nearly 500 metres will be rewarded in literature coffee not only by a fantastic view of the city but also by Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere and, above all, about the correct air quality of the literature.
Costs for a New Soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite the abundance of glass surfaces, is an environmental model project," Troubost says.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Although the mountain of the Book is under glass roofs, the sun will soon fall on it in clear daylight.
The wide range of timber plants, which are found in the perpendicular glass façade, is dark and absorb most of the sun’s better.
The atmosphere in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is fully secured by automatic wheelchairs.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verheig was here too.
A professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Boward, also called Buchenberg "the soul of the Spanish who has not been caught".
Reason: Within a few weeks before the opening of each home, each resident received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books had to be placed in empty spaces on poles not completely completed -- at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The hands are held in trust.
"Nothing is worse than a half-loss library," said architect Vini Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has something to do with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only for beauty.
Thus, MVRDV was able to address the royal task, which is called the establishment of identity on a professional train.
Spanish wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for building identity.
"The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
In the view of Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is thus balancing on a short diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany began to understand that it was voting against Palestinian applications for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
Germany also abstained from the entry into force of the flight ban at the time of its meeting in Libya in March 2011.
NATO therefore made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from the policy that the United States has managed to own German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a common policy for Europeans.
Thus the Germans are again separated from the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to it.
I think they're just playing their role, but they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy conducted by France or Great Britain.
What, specifically, does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, which is from export and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are significantly different from those of other major States and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First of all, Germany has large supply markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to disturb the public and elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to this, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans.
Has Germany been affected by its relations with the United States, holding back from important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I am convinced that in Europe and even in the United States, German perceptions prevail.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This indicates that it should be recognized as a game at the international level and that it should be considered to be of interest.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the contrary, was clearly speaking about veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European States?
Such differences have always existed because of the American internal policy.
I believe that the Government of Obama has a sufficient understanding of the European position in the soul.
However, because of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences in opinion are not as important as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyihu, note that Obama is not at all in the forefront of Netanyah's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the status of an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, Germany would be a bit easier if there were a single, non-conforming European policy, but it is not.
They cannot therefore speak in a broader approach and must rather act on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is understandable that this is not easy for Germany, although it is because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been fascinating.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself in the role of an important international game, wouldn't it really play a major role?
Or does Germany still play a leading role?
Germany has not yet been accustomed to this, it has always been uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it has always been difficult to play a significant role.
Let us consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany plays an important role, there are different anti-German feelings.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
Of course, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account the most diverse neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Thus, the influence of the US on European policy is constantly weakening, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this vacuum, which remains?
Germans simply have to play a more important role.
Even if it does not please you, it is a life you dislike or a life you do not like!

"Protection of Goods" in China: when Puma and Armani become Chinese immediately
Armani is a world famous trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what about Armani Polo?
This is the name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with companies whose names have been acquired.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original name have submitted a request.
But even then it's not clear whether they can get away with their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trade marks in China," said Thomas Patloh, lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of goods rights in the Far East.
On my desk every week there is a new case of this kind.
Imitators have enough to add a few letters in order to obtain the right to register their trade marks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
Patloh opens a folder with records of the registered trade mark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name also used for the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that China is a world champion for copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In many cities there are multi-ethnic universes that sell almost exclusively.
Patloha, however, is not, on the orders of its creditors, against the fact that Chinese companies have been officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "bank Minpa", a passport.
This word is associated with "Ban Dokuan".
That's what they call women who go after rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize their guilt
"It damages business, and it needs to be fought," Patloh assured.
"The trade mark is confused, the unique situation is gone, the image is very much suffering."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of road copying products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with an annual sales of EUR 15 billion, is the third largest and fastest growing market for growing goods.
However, it is difficult to remove suspicious records in the trade mark register, and this is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattalol tells of cases in which the court rejected the appeal, as long as the disputed name has been “real market”.
If it doesn't tie up, it will even have to pay the plaintiff, as it did its trade mark in China, says Patloh.
Sometimes the law of jungles is made here.
There are also significant cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machinery, a company that had recently acquired the company-producer of Putzmeister.
Thus, Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The purchaser Volvo Geely first used the blue-white logo mentioned by BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of Lacoste fashion products lost in China imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore, which saw the so-called crocodile on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Register of Goods in Beijing confirms that there was difficulties in 2010 due to the lack of staff and equipment.
In the past year, however, there has been “a return from the emergency situation in the work process to the standard”.
Thus, the number of outstanding hate cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
At least 81,500 claims are still awaiting production in the office.
It's worth fighting this road.
As in China very often, the figures are impressive.
Last year more than 1.4 million trade mark protection declarations were made in CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has managed a list of new registrations around the world on a 10-time basis, reports the public.
The same applies to the total number of actual trade marks, totalling 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan congregations were paid.
To simplify this means that each registration will be between 1280 June or 160 euros.
It is worth more than once, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concert has fought against the Chinese plagiarist.
Germany has been able to ensure that the illicit production of separate car details has been eliminated.
However, the immitator upheld the Chinese rights of the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was a personal mistake, as families in Germany were not protected, says Hanno Ventcler, President of the Government of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trade mark registration firm rejected the claims of monks.
It is true that Freudenberg won in both of the following instances, but the opposition continued to fight.
Must Be Started
The issue is now under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Ventsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extraordinary and we have a lot of time, money and nerves."
Whether domestic costs are easily taken into account, the company's archive has even had to be reviewed for centuries in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg consistently offered the opposite side "a large amount of six euro" for settlement.
"From here it's clear how much it cost us," says Ventcler.
The dangers of the Middle East are threatened even in Europe.
In that case, if the sponsors are registering unprotected trade marks there.
Yes, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for fur and leather products.
The Concentration has long ceased production in these areas, but has been able to prevent registration.
"There must be a start," said Ventcler.
Both he and Patloh’s lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trade marks that aliens should soon "in any way be protected, also registered in China," says Ventcler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg has lost its trade mark drama in the last act, it will have to pay on the contrary license collections for its own name, Ventcler explains.
Otherwise, we'll get out of the market in the dispute segment.
World Day of AIDS: to cope, five, to help
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's horn is repeated, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland are glad to do so.
History of relationships over more than 8733 kilometres.
At first, tension is divided: cubes, basketball cruises, dolls, and male bats pick up a taxi on the park floor and quickly find it.
Two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of the singers gradually increase - the altar, the bass, the tenor and the soprano - they will rise up and be amazed and follow each other.
And Féte Hopf, a 29-year-old director, doesn't hear out of his mother-in-law tuffel when he drives them with flexible and expressive muscles.
On Monday evening, in the musical hall of the Medical Psychology Institute in Hidelberge, Hor Imbongi repeats a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human geneticists to the court.
"Om "Obani" is an unusual thing, each voice has its own text, and the same is in a perfectly foreign language: a zulus, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme is estimated to be around 34 million HIV-infected worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans living with AIDS.
At the same time, more than 40 per cent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Esitjan, the Voices for Africa has found a head in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take care of yourself.
It guarantees a child's money at school, school form, and a daily hot meal in the Gogo Centre.
Immunities in the Zulu language mean a speaker or a praiser.
In this room they don't talk about running on the bench, so they can do five.
For nearly ten years, the choir has learned songs in this foreign language and from time to time has even brought them back where they first appeared in South Africa.
At the distance of 8733 miles [8733 km] from Hidelberga, northwestern Swaziland, is the village of Esitjani, which depends on the votes of the German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some of which are still in simple hygienics from clay and sand, among the population of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from HIV infection.
In Esitjana, the miniatura reflects the disease of all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest expected life expectancy in the world by UNICEF data.
The reduction of the maximum wage in men who have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half is almost unacceptable among the population.
A higher rate of population in Swaziland is the virus of immunodeficiency, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but before the Imbogny participants saw a number of children on the streets that were not only concerned with parental care but also simply: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, people in a poor country have no chance at all.
This was initially a private obligation of individual participants - for several euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But last year, the Voices for Africa was founded, which has been almost professionally concerned about AIDS orphans in Essitjan.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial IPP includes syphilis, chlamidiosis and tripper (gnorea).
The HIV, human papilloma virus, general herpes and hepatitis are common among the viruses.
Lobby pedicules and particles are related to parasitic IPPs.
What are the main groups of victims?
Syphilis and honours are met mainly by men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have resulted in sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults are often exposed to sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamidial infections, trichomonia, candidosis (grabock), glare and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low among us, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlorothiazide infections are much more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
We also have a common human papillam virus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are mandatory.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koha Institute, has doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
That's about a decade less than in the past year.
What are the symptoms of vengeful disease?
Infectious diseases may result in genital mutilation, complaints of forced abortion, appointment, life-threatening pain, as well as pneumonia or vomiting.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Conservatives are able to reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially in the frequent exchange of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, most PIPPs can be cured and avoided far-reaching consequences.
The chief, the victims and not least the gloves of people all over Germany allow for something to be collected.
"We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Essenten,” said Annete Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the very village of Germany, there is the Dlamina Códoba, a conscious and active woman.
It will also ensure that orphans are well equipped, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Goss, as they call the crazy old woman, is a village nurse.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a head covering, and make sure that children appear in the form of lessons every day.
Those who are not born will enter the home of Hannizila, the only woman who receives a combined salary, as well as two couples who are preparing for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Voices for Africa Association organized a Swedish school, built two smokers and, together with the American Health Organization, organized HIV analysis for many rural residents.
It's hard to imagine, but a disease that is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer deep silence.
A King With 14 Women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's about sex."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king is officially 14 women.
The last absolute black monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excellence.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the life-style of such a licensed State is also responsible for the rapid spread of IC virus in the past year.
But it is also located on ships that separate the virus from the country.
Free reserves are literally on each corner, says Annete Lennartz, "but they're almost out of use.
The second culture is flat."
In order to support the cultural exchange, Hor Ibmogni has been traveling to South Africa every two and a half years and has been singing songs, full of thunders, war spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many on the south side of the Black continent have known since the time of the apartheid.
The bus, full of white people who sing songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but it has even led to tears in the eyes of serious frontiers.
The trip also always takes place in Essitjan, where the children are visited by the underprivileged children.
Although a small village with difficulty can be found on a map, in the valley of Eculvani it is more known than ever.
"Go to Essitjani, there's the world," said some curious people.
And after an 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the drummers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, it can be seen that the light is also burning here.
Ambassador: NASA opens ice in Mercuria
The "messenger" zone has found evidence that there's ice on the planet of Mercury.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Society of NASA has proved that there is ice on the planet of Mercuriy.
Although it is located close to Solnzo, there is also frozen water as shown in three studies published on Thursday in the Special Journal of Science.
The "messenger" zone has found evidence that the planet is constantly covered by ice in the darkness of the region.
Its thickness should be at least 30 cm and possibly up to 20 metres.
It is estimated that water is caused by comets or perhaps by asteroid that met with Mercuria.
No one connects with the opening of money with the existence of life on the planet, said scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Fahrenheit [426 ° C].
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other life - building elements have fallen into other parts of the solar system.
For earth's inhabitants, telescopes and small works, for example, Fenix, are studying the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they travel to Earth images: small spots in endless ages.
The picture comes from cameras developed by German researchers from Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Creera.
As with Pluton, which is orbiting the Sun for Neptune, Crea, on a new definition of the International Astronomy Union since 2006, it is not “planned”.
This fraction of the infrared photo by the Specter telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue points are more difficult to identify in the star circle the pink "neighbourished" stars.
This region of stars - scientists call it W5 - will be opened by the telescope "Spitter" in the Caspian Union for 6500 light years.
This moving star star phototaped the NASA telescope "Spitter".
It looks like a bullet is made up of material that the star has emitted in the process of dying.
In the giant darkness of Trinidad, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are emerging from gas and dust.
NASA's telescope "Spitter" made this photo of the Galactic Birth Hall.
The Pleiades constellation, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, with a telescope, they get better.
As a red eye, Ulitka's vision of the darkness of this infrared photo.
It is located at 700 light-years away at the Waterway.
The link with the continent has led to this darkness caused by North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photographs provides an excellent color transfer.
This new star has been photographed in all its beauty only with the help of Infrared Telescope Specter.
Saturn and his key: How they emerged is one of the great orders of astronomy.
It's probably about the moon of Saturn, which suddenly disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and clearest photos of the Hubble telescope: the Galactic of Water
Depending on the color transfer of the photographs of spiral galaxies, the art is now produced.
The image published by the European South Observatory shows the darkness of Trinidad at the Streller's concentration for several thousand light years.
The name Trifide comes from a Latin word trifidus (third, triangular) as dark spots divide the heart of the star into three parts.
Astronomers have taken photos of the forecast of space collision: 400 million light years from Earth's core of two floating galaxies are meeting each other and will inevitably meet.
This is the birth of Hubble's telescope in a spiral galaxy of M83.
Those who don't like technical reductions may call it "The South Corps."
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows the fragment of Iris' darkness in the Cephea Society.
The darkness of 1400 light years is made up of particles of dust that range from 10 to 100 times less than the usual household dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray photographs of various telescopes.
It shows a figure of 430 million light years from Earth.
This galaxy group called Arp 273 photographed NASA Space Telescope Hubble.
More spiral galaxies are called UGC 1810.
In this constellation there is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The constellation is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, combined with the darkness of Rosetta, is also constantly creating new stars - at the distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright light, light galaxies with a small black hole are no more than gas.
Researchers believe that it occurred shortly before the Great Explosion when there was mainly water in the universe.
Our Views in the Universe: Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem before Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescopes have become increasingly visible, and their view of space is deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the telescope "Hale" at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The circle here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., a "Great Binocural Telescope".
It allows space to look through two circles, each diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescope Canaryas has a giant internal device - a diameter of just one circle is 10.4 meters.
The "Great South African Telescope" circle in South Africa is segmented to reduce its value.
Nevertheless, it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
The lack of short-term structural performance: the telescope is firmly fixed under a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-Eberley" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its specificity: high lighting capacity.
It reaches -- despite the relatively small diameter of the circle -- the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to foreign signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the project “Research for Foreign Minds” (SETI), any computer owner can assist by providing his or her computer with his or her computing power.
Type of observation of the European Astronomy Service (ESO) in the Czech Andeans.
This is where the Father of the Great Telescope is entirely in harmony with his name.
Its four wheels allow even the average infrared spectrum to be revealed in the visible tube.
The ESO also plans to establish a European Large Telescope Eye.
Its main circle should be broken down to a total of 42 metres - and it will be composed of nearly 1,000 circular elements.
However, photographs should be expected by 2018.
By 2007 both Kek telescopes on the Hawaii Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They contain two circles of diameter by 10 meters.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which is also seen in the sky with the help of Sobaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should be shown on Mauna Kea with a circle diameter of thirty metres.
Here they can be loved by the illustration.
However, the most important species of space is the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Capeller Space Telescope has been looking for planets beyond the solar system, especially those on which life can be possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been discovered from the start of the mission.
The photos have been printed on the latest preparation of the Capeller Space Telescope.
The space telescope James Webba (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on the Aryan 5 rocket.
The main circle of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescopes is that he must search for a great explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that the south Pole of Mercuria is ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger returns to the north Pole of the planet.
For decades, voluntary contributions have shown that there is ice in Mercuria.
Thanks to the 2004 "messenger" zone, the first one to return to the area of Mercuria, the scientists are now convinced.

Search for a divorce in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Travel through the Tales Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
Microwaves are packed along the broad road along the rocky forests of hills, windy rivers, and simple Christian homes.
All around you is so green and bright that you can think of being in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is all over a few miles from here.
There are talles here - one of the Kawkaz's people, who is known only for their excellent speech in Persian and Azerbaijani and for their longevity.
The final item is Lerick.
A small town is surrounded by a very heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not at all harmonize with the mountainous landscape.
Tourists from Europe are almost here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too narrow.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 miles [323 km], since the road has a total area.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the Caspian Sea oil is here in the province until it has recovered.
However, Pilate Fatuleva (48) is convinced that there is more to be interested in tourists in Lerika.
"In May Baku celebrated the festival of song Eurovision - and next year we will have the festival of the older people of the world," Fatuleva says.
She's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biographies are documented here about eight dozen tallies from these places, which are over 100 years old. The photograph is shown in the Black and White Photography.
This is my grandmother. He's been here for 120 years.
At 136 years of age, he had another baby
But the controversial star is the Chapman of Shirali Muslimov, who had been executed for 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, are not.
In view of the fact that the older man whose age was confirmed by documents was completed in 122 years, the age of Muslims seemed extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatuleva.
A man was married three times, and he had 23 children, when he was 136 years old, as if he had a daughter.
So did the Muslim chauffeur add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholtz, an adult researcher at Max Plank Institute in Rostoque, has heard about the debt in Central Asia.
"A lot of people of advanced age can also meet in some parts of China, Japan or the Huns Valley in Pakistan," said Scholtz, "and in Sardinia there are also very old people who are extremely elderly."
However, because of the lack of documents, it was impossible to confirm age because there were no records of civil status.
Every day the fuel tank is burned
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the Lérika area are often too old to age Bible.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many people in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mujimzade explains this to particular species of whales.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the other hand, believes what's happening in the food.
Tales like meat, bread and most of the dairy products, many of them drink hot oil every day. However, even if such a high calorie diet can be healthy from a diet perspective.
Or is it a matter of life that keeps people young in the first place? In Chengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerick, there is Ruba Mirzoeva.
At 97 years of age, she was still relatively young for these expansions.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the ground with a bottle of oil that doesn't stand there.
Here under one roof are eight people, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirza, whose grandchildren have been living for a long time.
There's also two small jumps in the neighborhood.
In the kitchen guests make tea, which is served in typical wooden caskets of the army.
At Mirzay's ideal level and firm white teeth, under its head, it will cross the long dark-red hair that her son proudly exposes to us.
I've always washed my hair, so they never fell and kept the flowers.
"And I never used champagne," says Mirzaeva.
Each month’s pension is sufficient for life
She's always been just what grew up in her own yard, her skirts, her pants, her shirt.
For the rest of my life, I never bought anything in the store.
Then she tells of her husband who served in the army.
It was more difficult after World War II.
But it's better when "love's father" Gadar Aliev got up in his role.
The propaganda does not often sound like the words of an old woman.
However, the culture created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan is virtually unknown.
He was in power until 2003, and then he took his son Ilham away from the government.
However, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
Some 230 currencies (e.g. the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly pensions for local conditions for which it is possible to live well.
And perhaps the oldest son of Mirzaev also has the right to say, "The stars in our culture are deeply respected".
They live in a large, loving family, surrounded by care and happiness.
Why don't you stay alive as long as possible?
The word “human rights” is not found in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Contestant demonstrations in Cairo testify to the depth of the country ' s dispersion.
The future constitution based on the charyat has met with tremendous resistance.
The Egyptian president didn't pick up on a papaphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility before the people and before the God," he said on public television.
His words were addressed to all the people, but first of all to Christian concepts, liberals, educated Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
Indeed, all those who are still hopelessly in a state of disillusionment are experiencing fear.
Fear of the religious State in the Nile at the hands of the powerful "Muslim Brothers".
Mohammed Mursey, whether he's not sorry, said that he temporarily challenged the constitutional court's competence and expanded his competence to "save the revolution".
However, in fact, the 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate at the University of South California does not want to save the Egyptians and the rest of the world.
Will the power of the judiciary be lost?
In fact, 234 articles were able to pass through a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to the Islamic constitutionally constructed congregation of 100 participants, which is partly a cause of fear.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that court proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and remains the case of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use complex formulations and the resulting legal gap for a more strict interpretation of the Shari.
At the very least, this is an updated article: in all cases concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country that has been used by the greatest authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not be done, but it may mean that the government is monitoring legislation that would, in fact, result in a limitation of judicial authority.
Many are the subject of interpretation in the draft Constitution
Another problem is that civilians should remain subject to the military court.
During the Mubarak regime, these courts served as opposition courts.
At the end of the dictatorship, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
As stated in the draft, the State must also protect “the true substance of the Egyptian family” and “the maintenance of its moral and values”.
This is so legally formulated that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature by means of this article.
The open text means nothing but censorship.
At all times, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
So there is one who forbids [the murder of] Muhammad and his messengers.
But what such humiliation and how it must be punished remains unclear.
There is also doubt as to the wording that “management” is prohibited.
Will it be enough for the president or for the jury?
The question of interpretation, as many of the projects proposed by Murcia to sign and which, he said, would be presented to the Egyptians at the referendum.
"The revolution is back."
For several weeks, opposition has been formed against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered together at an extraordinary assembly on Friday evening in Tahrir, Cairo, and were about to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
Laurent of the Nobel Peace Prize and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, said that the draft constitution was a place of “the collapse of history”.
Through the service of short news Twitter, he accused Mursi's commitment to lead "the fight against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his yard and take him away," said the oppositioner Jasser Said.
"We have not yet established that our brothers' blood has not been recovered," Egyptian media quoted Haled Ali's opposition policy opposition policy.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe a referendum that would make it ineffective.
"The Koran - Our Constitution"
The well-organized "Muslim Brothers" in turn called for a counterdemeanor demonstration, but cautionably, not at Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Cairo University.
It included a large number of women who were covered and engaged in salafists who cried out: “The people are required to apply God’s law”.
They needed Murzy to say, "Clean the country!" and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area where everything began led to the state of virtually civil war.
The Mursey investigators obviously didn't want to go at this risk.
The "Muslim Brothers" said that both the opposition and the parties to the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to allow the people to decide in the polling forum where the country should go.
Most of the Islamists' project is considered to be a decisive case.
"The concept of "human rights" is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Saeda in the light of this forced constitutional process, which was to be extended until February with all public forces.
The 48-year-old Human Rights Lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) protected the “Muslim Brothers” when they were in or before the court at Mubarak.
Not because he has divided their view into worlds, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
That's why he was shot, convicted, arrested.
And now the word "human rights" is never met in the new constitution, he regrets speaking to "Welt am Sontag".
The increase in the influence of Mursey on all three virtues of the State is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear violation of the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil State, the President de facto cancelled it,” Saeda regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that all of them have left him, even the international community that looks at the ideological fight against the direction of the Nile with a mixture of love and tension.
That's why you can pay for it.
"You create a monster you can't control."
Norway's rapist: the world's dumbest fishing?
In the five million people of Norway, one of the highest levels of life is not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Is it possible that the country's success was somehow linked to a local pursuit of an extremely violent fishing bloke?
Here's a couple of red-haired cheeses.
Put them in a bag of dirty and dirty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a few weeks.
You'll have a devastating smell of rape -- one of the most famous Norwegian delicacys.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air it's different from the unusable natural smell.
Rakfisk is a well that is salted and salty in water by year, depending on what the soul needs to get.
As summers and winters are dwindling, Norwegian crowds are gathered at the Fagernes festival on the same subject, so to speak.
"They eat raw and drink a cup of water, a local dark stream," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fire department and co-operation by the "accompanied general" leading to the festival.
People around us eat little fish cubes and drink their small portions of alcohol.
"Someone prefers aquavit more than a raccoon," Howard says.
This drink is able to break the smell.
I'm gonna try a couple of cubs.
If you can get a knife under your nose, it's not as bad as it is -- it's a little different than the dry bag you've been driving for a long time in the bus.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when fish were trapped in hermetically closed bottles with saltwater.
Then a deep winter, when the fish had already been well and thoroughly contaminated, drew it out and, by means of alcohol, used it in food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country in search of work and to immigrate mainly to the United States is still a reminder of the past generation.
At the same time, there are more than 13 per cent of the population who are migrant workers, high wages and social security systems.
The people of Sweden (an old rival and not yet a much more profitable neighbor) are here to work.
The rape is perceived as an important symbol, an irrevocable, even several elements of the past Norway.
It's one of the most expensive locals.
On the other hand, you'll be paid 9 pounds (U.S. 14 dollars).
Norway is rarely seen in the world news, and most of the country's population seems to suffer from it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Breevik, a racist and extremist right-wing figure, in the last year of the shooting and killing 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the tract is called "the 22nd of July".
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their country of peace one of their citizens has become capable of such atrocities and killings.
On the basis of the present prosperity of Norway, growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) is one of the world's largest oil industries.
"The oil, however, is not the only cause of our prosperity," said Anna, our officer, contrasting attitudes with sustained rapaciousness, a woman with long-light hair and slightly deep eyes, the promotion of normal well-being.
We are a people who are called by your name.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like to show up, we're not comfortable.
Norway is very careful about its oil, and most of the revenues of the oil industry are invested in a special fund for future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money that had not been spent was carefully taken into account by Norway.
"Peace can fall on the beaches in the winter and go in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a rapist," she adds with careless smile.
I'm standing in the snow looking for someone else's rifle with me.
There's a hamburger with a lot of meat. It's already an exotic, tasteful piece of meat.
But tonight we expect even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special use of the trailer during which the visitors in the vote determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct telefer in which they show the guide in the glove box, surrounded by trailers.
This looks like the Eurovision song competition.
"So, Tor-Jurgen, what's the score you put for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
They all laugh and cry.
Someone's falling out of the chair, maybe he's been looking for aquavit.
And maybe it's just a smell of this fish.
President of Mexico Enrique Penya Noto has a difficult career start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Penya Nate is preparing to enter the post, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to consider the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country ' s people.
Road movement in Mexico is now particularly in a crying state.
The city was overloaded by transport and at the best of times, and from Monday there were standing fences that cut several key majors to the capital and caused chaos on the streets.
This was done, however, not in order to prevent people from working for the prizes, but to discourage the protesters from going to Parliament.
In the resurrected new head of Mexico Enrique Pénja Note will be the presidential link and will welcome the country's government.
There's an easy task ahead of him.
Mexico has obtained good economic indicators at the administration of Felipe Calderon, which now has its powers, but the country has collapsed in the fight against drugs, which has taken some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government is telling the people of Mexico of its willingness to fight violence," said Mr. Pña Note, President Barauk Obama of the White House, earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Prior to such statements, the political career of Mr. Pña Neto, President of the United States, was developed as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
His family, in a densely populated and broad state of the capital of the country, shared the views of the new leaders.
A single person
In the idyllic city of Valé de Bravo, for example, they remember him with warmth.
The population deserves tourism, the development of the curative area and the establishment of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new six buildings built by Mr. Panya Neto, which are different from the streets with elections and farms that were previously in this place.
The tables with its name are based on the modern building of the sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are bringing hope to him for real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Erndandes, a congressman of the country headed by the New institutional-revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to these and crucial changes that are so urgently needed by our country, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of permanent residence, the PRI party was exaggerated in 2000 by White Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Court, the party has given high hopes to Enrique Pénja Néto.
In addition, he questioned the inconsistencies that had caused the new President to oppose.
It is very direct and highly committed to improving its vision of the future country.
It's a very high government agent, and above all, a man with the ability to listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkotoll, also known as the City of Nassa, is the most diverse contrast with the powerful streets of Valé de Bravo.
Hidden under the roofs of cars, it is in many ways a reward for Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality also bear the severe nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, drug trafficking gangs in these areas had been lured into the army; violence against women was particularly intense here.
A number of dozens of dead women have been found in the desert just in the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico during the reign of Mr. Pña Nété, which is much more than a figure in the highly celebrated violence in the city of Ciudad-Huares, whose name has become ridiculous when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pña Neto ' s comments, it could be said that he had not been able to deal with the problem of women ' s murder while he was in his position as governor.
At the same time, his administration is charged with fully ignoring the problem.
The concrete home home, like most houses in this covered area, Irina Bundija has a hard time holding her tears, showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version in 2010, suicide took place.
However, her family thinks she's killed her founder.
"When I got home, it seemed like her body had died before that," said Mrs. Bundi.
It was signs of her being killed, and the body was already covered.
Mariana's mother reexamines this story, and the portrait of her daughter is looking at us from the wall, where she's looking at a series of ambiguities on which the same word is drawn: justice.
That is what they said was rejected by this family.
"The officials of the state have treated me like an old-fashioned, inflexible offender.
They want people to believe everything they say, and they want people to believe it.
But that's not right, so it can't be, especially when there are so many violations and failures," she says.
With the hope of a presidential meeting on Saturday, President Pña Neta will take on an easy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence crimes, and the new President has promised to address this problem as a priority during his rule.
"I hope he will be exactly the same President as he was the governor," says Oliver, a Vale de Bravo congressman from the PRI party.
However, the family of victims in Sudad-Nessa is particularly threatened by this.
Bradley Manning has not complained about ill-treatment, he claims.
The prosecutors were trying to refute Bradley Manning's statement on the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manninga's stay in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection is required to close the case on the basis of the harsh conditions of Manning ' s detention.
A number of thousands of secret documents were charged by the United States Army.
On Friday the charges were tried to prove that a series of Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest escape of stolen materials in the history of the United States, had not been used by many of the opportunities to complain of ill-treatment that he had to be transferred to military prison.
During a cross-examination hearing in Fort Media, the state of Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feinn, stated that the records of the weekly visits of Menninga to the prison administration by the representatives of the prison for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the application for protection against the termination of Menning ' s case on the basis that the conditions of his conviction were cruel and self-contained were sufficient punishment on the following day after Menning stated that he was in custody and intended to commit suicide.
The intelligence data analysis specialist arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents during Iraq ' s service.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been filled after the visits of the representatives of the Administration during his visit to Quantico prison, where he had been under the strict conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Dr. Fein asked for reports on Friday, Menning admitted that he appreciated the treatment of himself by the prison administration as a "primary" and the general conditions of detention as a "professionally organized face".
The reports considered do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manninga has directly questioned the conditions under which it was contained.
Menning replied that he had expressed his deep concern about these problems and that his representatives from the administration had discussed these problems with him and had said that they would be involved but did not think about it in writing.
"They wrote "no problems" (after my complaint), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this subject in the first place," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about having been treated unfairly in January 2011 at a meeting of the Commission on the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Menning replied that at that meeting he wanted to get rid of the regime of “traumatic prevention” and ease the conditions of detention.
The representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited detention regime, at a lower level than the surveillance regime for the purpose of preventing suicide, was introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I want to let the administration know that I have everything to do in order to cancel the anti-traumatic regime... to improve the quality of my life from my point of view," Menning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to prison at the military base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had been thinking of suicide in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness because of a violent earthquake.
He explained that psychologically it's very difficult when you don't know how your participation is resolved and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has fallen to the Camp-Arafjan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small room - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - in total isolation.
Menning reports that he was allowed to leave only matras, clothes, shoes, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, either to sleep or even to sleep at a certain time of the day.
According to Manning, during his dream, there was always a light that penetrated the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he fell asleep at night, they would wake him up and force him to turn around.
The counsel of Manning filed an official complaint about the abuse of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Menninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he had made at the time of his fourth testimony that after one night he was forced to sleep in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand large before the guards and other prisoners in the morning check.
Manning stated that it was not possible to cover the suit during the check.
In response to the court's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's orders that he should wash the clothes that might be covered but admitted that no one directly ordered him to burn it.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning reported that he had told the officer that he could use a truce or spleen to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his lower whites, sleeks and eyes were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account what he had to experience during his detention and will significantly reduce the time limit if Menning will be recognized by the military court responsible for starting his case at the beginning of the following year.
The defence stated that it was planning to propose Menning to acknowledge the blame for less serious crimes and that other charges were excessive.
Renewal of hearings is planned for these outputs, and it is expected that the accused party will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Menning has been held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of arrested persons with a maximum strict regime.
Among the charges made by Menning are the victimization of an opponent, the illegal promotion of data on the Internet, the transfer of information on national defence, and the acquisition of public property or documents.
If he is convicted of all the points of the indictment, he may be threatened with life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans had been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of capacity to realize themselves.
The Mexicans are willing to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are divided into two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I traveled by corridor for visitors, approached the border control area, and sat down.
The signs indicated two directions: one for Mexicans (Mexico), the other for Foreigners (foreigners).
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds. I don't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York say they're Italians.
Later, I stopped on the complex structure "American of Mexican origin".
But I was here in Mexico.
There was no need for conditional names or complex constructions in my grandfather's family.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than language users, and I can't escape the American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and set out for Extrajeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Henrike Pña, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was used to meet the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pña Néto spoke with enthusiasm about the support of the Mexican economy, which now enables Mexicans to remain in Mexico rather than relocate to the United States.
He would like to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block like the EU.
In addition, President Pña Neto promised to continue the war against drug users in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, dealing with the United States is a difficult and complex issue.
Most Americans had never thought that in 1848 the United States had entered Mexico and under Winnipeg forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see memories of those events everywhere.
Therefore, it is only for any State actor of the United States to speak up even if he is critical of Mexico, the press and the elite of the Mexican society are still complaining that the Americans are under the jurisdiction of their neighbours.
And the descendants of the Montesumas are served by military power.
The most complex is that of Mexico with more than 35 million indigenous Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about experiments?
That's enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers who are in this country for themselves and those who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexico's origin were only for one reason: at some point in their family history, no one - father or grandfather - had the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and had to move north.
Most of all, they were Mexicans of a certain type, young, educated from poor Christian families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
It's different in Mexico.
Today, our life is an area of American dream, we've learned in good schools and we've got a good job, but let's not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider.
United States of America.
At the same time, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the working class do not like us.
We answer the same question.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating injuries and treat us as second-class people, as are Mexicans today.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Only our existence for them is explained by failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
We would not be in a bad mood now to find a way of life in the United States but to lose spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalhare and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain trainings among these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans more clearly understand their national identity, and that is common among Mexican Americans.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well - known Mexican Americans do not feel any belonging to one of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we're also in love with Bruce Springstin.
Getting the best out of the two worlds, you're definitely losing your roots.
In Mexico we're Americans.
And in the United States we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I have explained during my trip, as if our relations were not being lost enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work for their own type of mission to Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country is and how to visit it well, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen their relations with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's going to happen.
Too much effort in the past.
In view of the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country to be such a beautiful country.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
And that's fair.
If part of the Mexicans can still not forgive the United States for having arrived with Mexico a half century ago, they will also have to accept that some of the Americans of Mexico's origin are still trying to get together with their relatives.
Yes, sir.
Please, we have more general than I've been told.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The cease-fire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group can be a grave foundation for a further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelites in the Middle East possible?
The regular circulation of blood transfusions is based on the conclusion that such hopes are valid.
It sounds like a common, unintended argument about who was the first time; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians were killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; first during the conflict from the territory of the Gaza Strip, rockets fell into the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the desperate Israelis and the Palestinians in their eternal conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This can be seen in a different way, but the “Arab mass” events have surrounded many of the realities that have emerged, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to remain in the grip of the region's drought.
As a result, their fight may become even more bloodthirsty than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope for the outcome of this deadly trap.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation did not give rise to optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement signed on 21 November was to be fulfilled, the positions of the two parties had only been strengthened by the strengths of the two parties this week.
The leaders of the Islamic Movement of Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they forced Israel to leave despite their losses.
Despite the destruction of some group leaders and 1.7 million people were blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing its popularity on the west bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently under control by the more moderate Fath movement.
In addition, Hamas leaders can fully conclude that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world increased in Hamas, new influential and rich friends appeared.
The emerging regional leader, Turkey, who once was a close associate of Israel among Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas; his example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The Hamas trading parties declare the establishment of an Israeli Islamic semi-month round - from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah armed group is headed to Syria, where more and more Muslim rebels are under siege by Barara Assada, and beyond Jordan, where the Hamas allies are threatened by the king.
The most significant change in the balance of force in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in Egypt, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, where the movement of the Brethren was strengthened by President Muhammad Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was confused in 2011, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas ' support.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more tolerant of populism.
In future diplomatic districts, Hamas can become a major game that cannot even shut down Israel and America.
At the same time, the parties will come to the opposite conclusions in Israel.
In the military sense, Hamas was wounded.
The Israeli anti-racquet system "The Iron Corps" has justified the cost of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained in its constant position; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the last cycle of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Benjamin Netanyah, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has been able to bring to a minimum the problem of death terrorists, partly through the wall that falls on the West Bank of the Jordan, a significant part of the unidentified Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the illegality of such acts from the perspective of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyihu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22nd January elections, joined with more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigdor Liberman.
What does it mean to create Palestinians and give them their own State?
If they put all authority in their hands on the West Bank, would they not begin to launch rockets from there in Israel, how do their meetings in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and make every effort to lift their heads.
It may be that the parties to the "hard" line have won; however, their calculations may be distorted by the Arabic flag.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries are not experiencing the hottest feelings of Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of the Israeli budget is more than all its Arab neighbours together.
The deployment of war with the regional superpower would help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt's President, Mursi, who worked with Barak Obama on the ceasefire, was a good sign and could be identified as the beginning of the change.
Israel must take into account the long-term effects of its policy.
As democratic change takes place in the Arab countries, the loss of Palestinians ' right to self-determination is a bomb of slow action which is either early or late on Israeli territories occupied by Israel, such as the bus that took place in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has already undermined the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the Arab population is only aggravating these problems.
Bloodless operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to push the Hamas movement are subject to growing dissatisfaction among the international community.
Both sides need external pulse.
The only solution remains that health-care representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our paper: the education of two States and Israel ' s approaches to security.
There is hope that, in the short term, it will not be too urgent for other countries to be affected more effectively by the conflict.
Egypt, which has long taken the decision to reopen arms supply in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has never had a useful position to convince Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the common use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than for the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama must also play his role in establishing Israel as the negotiating table.
During its first period, he did not present his own plan of peaceful settlement.
After his return to the White House, he continued to show a lack of interest in the solution to the problem.
It's a catastrophicly invisible position.
The United States is deeply interested in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Unified Packaging Act for Cigarettes came into force.
Warnings about smoking and imagery of damaged parts of the body are given in contrast to isolated green boxes that are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first international law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has entered into force, replacing logos and colouring of different brands of the same wool and olive colour with yellow pictures of sick parts of the body and images of children whose health is affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to various paintings and inscriptions warning against the use of tobacco, the only difference between packages introduced by this sub-sub-item is the names of brands printed in the same small font.
These are the most serious conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Australian Federal Government states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, leaving this harmful habit of fashion.
Based on such a decision, the results of studies showed that people who did not start smoking by the age of 26 never became smokers in 99 of 100 cases.
“It is clear that even in youth children understand the meaning of tobacco companies trying to produce packaging,” explains Minister of Health Tanya Plybersek, referring to studies that show that, for example, the root of the problem is associated with children with the idea of princessage.
Australia is one of the world's least-favoured countries, so these changes are not particularly affected by the arrival of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry was strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.
The tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market on which soft and accessible cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences other than those of its initiatives," said Scott McKintar, a representative of British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Manufacturers of separate products from China and Indonesia will place much more goods for sale on Australia's streets.
On the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for porters and silicone-foulers hiding in the package is growing strongly ( practically zero) since two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in Australia's high court, where they tried to appeal to this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already carried out some 6,000 goods to general trading companies and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential mix for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks among the population concerned.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal television advertising and support for sports activities, as well as prohibiting salesmen from placing cigarettes in public places, tobacco advertising has been transferred to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has banned local companies and websites from placing advertising on the web, but it cannot restrict this foreign site.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you've only got this little laser, the idea of moving your goods on the Internet is very deceptive," Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University, explains.
The Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on commercial brands written by individuals such as ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this really the case of a young citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he doesn't regret the power and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company?
The Australian Office of the British American Tobacco Company claims that the industry is now making more adjustments to new rules than to advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States make claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfair, despite the fact that trade relations between all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Pliersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced its first mandatory placement of anti-smoking photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of law enforcement is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, UAR and India.
Many smokers in Australia are reluctant to respond to innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just pick up a cigarette and put it in a box," explains Victor El Haege, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a piece of paper.
I'm telling you the truth, the only thing that can make me smile is my little girl.
James Yu, who led the king of the Pack shop at the center of Sydney, claims that the same package has made it difficult for the distribution of goods by fields
"I used to have time to load a new party and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and prohibit cigarettes at all, we would then say, 'What we're doing is finally closing the store,' he said, waving his hands up.
Scattering in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On that day of thanks I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical crashes and replaced it with another plane we were waiting for.
Thus, I had plenty of time to think about the nature of the forest.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for a trip is really embarrassing, and it won't help books, magazines, iPhones, or even retail shops.
In recent times, however, more and more child development scientists and specialists have benefited from the forest.
They say that, in certain situations, we and our children are less likely to get into such a bad situation.
This forces the brain to withdraw from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all always in front of some screen, the advantages of the woods are beyond us.
Could it be that we need to get to the corner?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll be back.
I used to think, as many have, that the treasure is a relatively recent invention when people have more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canary, Canada, author of the book "Incentive History of Skulls" (Boredom: A Level History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, it can be admired by a very ancient history," he says.
Latin inscriptions of the first century were found on the walls of Pompeii.
This remains an open question of how we understand the taste.
The problem is, says John D. Ijud, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that perception and vision of drought have often changed.
Having studied research materials on this subject and asked the target group in 100 people, Professor Iswood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: the shock is when people "want but can't deal with what would bring them satisfaction".
The difference between gossip and appetite, he says, is that the beating person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm hungry.
The main cause of the drought, he says, is “a violation of the attention and associated deterioration of the mood and the sense that time is slowing down”.
According to the description of the shock, it can be very similar to depression.
Professor Iswood, however, argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, sufferers see the causes of problems in the world and in the circumstances, and people who experience depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we're told that it's embarrassing when it's just hard for us to focus on something.
In his study "Inconsistency: Determining the School of Attention," published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Ijud and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment by which participants listened to the newspaper reading.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the television program in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at low frequency, so it was easy to understand them, and the third group only heard a recorded voice without a side-track.
Those who listened to television with low levels of noise noticed that they were embarrassed, that they often found it difficult to focus on others, but they did not know why and described it as a joke.
When we are trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, distraction may cause shock, says Mark J. Fence, a neurologist at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something interesting, "e.g., looking at things on a conveir looking for a marriage that can help you avoid scarcity."
It is believed that when people start to climb on the table or paint caracules on the bookboard, they do this out of fear, but now we know that such actions are actually just helping not to weaken physically.
"The study has shown that children who are not prohibited from getting and turning around learn better and forget more information than children who are required to sit quietly," said Professor Fenska.
At some point, we're all having a taste: when we're late for a trip (as in my case), listening to a monotonous thing, watching an interesting movie.
However, different people demonstrate different degrees of devotion to the scaffold.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “study scale” for measuring such individual characteristics.
For example, "Many of what I need to do is monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so I don't have enough time."
With such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are more likely to hit girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly in the presence of various external exhibitors.
In general, however, adolescents often fall apart.
In 1991, Reid Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving nearly 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said that they were at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said that they were abroad.
Only 3 per cent of parents noticed that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what such data would be about drought now, 21 years ago.
However, he knows that “in adolescence there is a point of dedication to the school, ” mainly because children and adolescents are not fully able to decide what to do.
Let's go back to my first question: the sake of profit?
Sometimes it is not because, as research shows, it may lead people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to escape the shock.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the relationship between treasure and creation, says Professor Vodanovic, who has been studying this problem for more than two decades.
"That's how our brain shows us something else to do; it's a joke," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this same brain does not always know what it is that is best to do.
If you're going to be bored and you're going to get this energy to play guitar or culinary experiences, you're doing better.
But if you're going to watch TV, it'll be better for you for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child jumps and you give him an iPad, he'll stop jumping, but he won't learn how to fight the odds by himself or by any other way to manage his time and work, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills operate in all kinds of situations,” he claims.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself but also to exercise self - control at all.
I don't think I need to take a shower.
But it's not worth considering something bad.
It is time to learn to feel comfortable even beyond a constant flow of action and technology.
Professor Iswood agrees with this.
"We see it so that we need to try the doll more often, while the doll is very unpleasant, an inexhaustible desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to break away from constant concern and simply relax.
"In today's world we've been accustomed to the constant overstimulation of the organs," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
Until it is impossible to apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team and a student of the public college in the southeastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be lawfully committed throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and tobacco in which he smoked.
Mr. Orosco said he was once in Lamar once in September and drove in a car across the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
Following the discovery by the police in Marihiwana, Mr. Orosko ' s agenda came to the court for the use of drugs and for the use of drugs - small offences for each of which was fined at $100 - and the date of the trial.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has continued a few weeks since the state of Colorado has voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small judicial cases depends not only on the law but also on the place of consideration.
The charges for small marijuana offences are already recorded in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already ceased to charge people at the age of 21 and older than the maintenance of small doses, which will be considered legitimate only within a few weeks of the entry into force of the law.
However, in more conservative areas, Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana and have long been responsible for the use of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, they have voted to prevent the appearance of new marijuana stores in their premises.
"All of this is developing so desperately that I don't even know what to expect any further," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the city of Avora, east of Denver.
The representatives of the control bodies in Washington have also been tasked with cutting heads.
They should lay down rules for the definition of the licensing procedure for the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which should be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, either good or bad, has overcome most other states in dealing with marijuana use, started with medical purposes, and now for pleasure.
“In Colorado a more simplified market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Governing Council for the Production and Production of Alcohol in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, rather than make any proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have this precedent that we could focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, entitled I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will enter into force throughout the year in the state of uncertainty when the public licensing system is not yet in place and the right of the marijuana is already legalized.
However, there are other minor technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to find a balance between the state's provision of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade in it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and children's gardens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed companies in the vicinity of the city, particularly in Seattle and its ports," explains Ben Livingston, representative of the recently established research group "Mariwan Law Centre".
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs of Auroray sent his subordinate e-mail message that the city's prosecutor would no longer attract people aged 21 to the responsibility of holding a small number of marijuana and that the police would cease to number people in these violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police, Outs, reported that the police would monitor the city's compliance with the rules governing the activities of Marhiwan for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The prosecutor of the Wald district in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the prosecution would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its users to attend the course of treatment.
At present, 119 persons have been charged with storing two and less evictions, although many of them are also accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution to pursue acts that are considered criminal at the time of their execution," Mr. Bak said in his statement.
Even in areas such as the rural area of Mesa, where voting participants rejected the proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Jancson police, the largest city in the area, no longer attracted seniors to the responsibility of controlling a small number of drugs.
District prosecutor Pit Houtzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to file charges for open-ended cases related to the custody of marijuana.
"I think it is our direct responsibility to ensure compliance with the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the inhabitants of Colorado who participated in the vote supported this decision, it would not be easy to include Marhiwan in the public and legal system.
In contrast, the reaction of the people in various parts of the state to the experiment by the local authorities in Marihiwan was disproportionate.
"There is a cultural barrier in the area of prosecutors in this matter," explains Sean Macalister, a Danish lawyer representing the interests of the Marhiwans in custody, and a local representative of the National Law Reform Organization on marijuana.
"They have been persecuting people for so long that they can't now calm down because it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first countries where the small number of marijuana addicts are like alcohol, are destined to become an experimental field at country level to check the very idea of legalizing drugs.
The legislator and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legitimate trade, but at the same time they are eagerly awaiting guidance from federal authorities who are still planning to consider the sale and development of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legislators hoped that the Office of Justice would be involved in this matter.
Despite a number of broad ranges of arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government has in most cases benefited from the trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Office for Drug Control would almost go home to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they would hardly close their eyes to the regulated authorities of the State of the Republic of marijuana, which are permitted under the new law, consider Kevin A. Sabette, former drug control adviser to the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado were not expected by the federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections, some local administrations approved moratoriums to open new marijuana shops, which could not be opened earlier than a year ago.
Last week, the city of Montrouz, in the western part of the state, had been subjected to a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which was likely approved next week.
"We do not want to be in such a position that we give someone a license, and then this will cause serious federal problems," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still very many unanswered questions.
Petronella Whitet: I was rescued from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views has not begun today.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an anti-civilization that has two basiss for freedom and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of studying at the historic college of the University of Oxford College at the end of the 1980s, I picked up some shirts and walked out of the first scandal in my life.
My father didn't scream and cry.
The friends were killed so much.
The Evening Standard said I blew up a college because I didn't like my singles having sex in the next room.
Author E. Norman Wilson lied that I was leaving because I had to drink from a cup of tea.
Actually, it wasn't that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically hurt and scared.
Not because of my unusual name or what I've been studying in my private school.
For one thing, I was suffering for one reason only, and in this famous triumphal procession of enlightenment it seemed to me to be this weird and blind fanaticism: my father, now a quiet Woodro Wyatt, was a well-known counselor, Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a conservatory.
You're asking why do you remember this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students with a right-centred view is subject to the same burden.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students needed the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the student club Corpus Cristi in Cambridge stated that they "are often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They would like to include in the Committee on Equal Rights an additional representative in order to ensure the freedom of expression of their opinion.
Their situation has only increased the recent increase in BBC 2 documentary film on the policy of the student environment “Staff: Young, smart and right” in which conservators presented excentriques and non-onacists.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, who will travel to Rolls Rose, wears a silver suit and many with a silver boot.
In other universities, students-conservatives complain that they are causing “debts due to higher fees for training”.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old Vice-President of the Nottingham Conservatives Association, said in an interview with one of the resurrected newspapers that “in the university environment, there is an increase in cross-cutting on the left hand side.
The people who do not even know us before consider us to be harsh and undecided children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old, a student of the history college of Corpus Cristi, who had been asked to strengthen protection, called such an atmosphere "indistinct", and Stephanie Cheryl, a 19-year-old new president of the Oxford Conservatives Association, said that the relationship of the student club to the rights-centred audiences had deteriorated significantly.
"This poses a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and to the normal life of members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I wasn't just a minority, I was one.
I arrived there in September 1986, a working and enduring eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford escaped hatred from the Conservative Party.
The year before that, the university had been voted by former student Margaret Tetcher for lowering budget appropriations for higher education.
Even Stalinists would be in such an atmosphere.
On the first day of the first week of high school, when the students were dating each other and with teachers, I first felt I was in front of them.
I had not yet learned that the teachers not only looked at the gloves of the students-conservatives but also gladly participated in it.
Political issues such as harassment, privatization and Government disagreement to apply sanctions against the Government of Apartheid in the UAR have resulted in the flow of widespread forest walls of the audience.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Whitet," said the teacher, now calm Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me a hard time, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very jealous man with a face like a cake.
"Tatechers don't usually teach French or they just don't get their brains?" he asked.
The other students were shocked.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few basic French lessons in free time, if you are of course not very busy returning to society," Pete whispered.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting for dinner, and then someone grabbed me from my shoulder.
It was James, a second-school student from the English language college who was a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who suspects in sympathy to conservators will be released.
It's not easy for me, but in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so you're gonna be more difficult.
Most of the primary conservatives are assumed to be lesbians."
Later, in the local pub, I tried hard to commit suicide.
I insisted that it wasn't according to all Margaret Tetcher's words.
The hit-and-run failed.
The professor of philosophy, politics and economics who studied in Estonia himself said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're infected."
Other students supported his words.
I was angry, guilty.
"How do condoms deal with sex?" asked one of them.
- They drive another car, right?"
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the end of criminal persecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I just have to meet the uniforms under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a lesbian and hide my current beliefs?
For three years, I have been known as a man, full of hatred and unity.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to conservatives but also for being an adviser to the Tatcher on foreign policy and one of its sponsors.
He didn't show up in college.
He condemned him for his provinciality, melodiousness and commitment to the historical view of Marxist-Determinist.
In 1997, he was appointed professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find refuge between relatives and unprincipled friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his school years, there were any political views.
"But it's the best university in the world," he lamented.
- There's no way there's no such thing as this. It's not just in the city of the dead bastards.
Even my communist friends always say themselves unstoppable."
His eyelids were moved.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you break the university."
I was devastated by the constant journey to London and my emotional protection.
My friend, as well as the conservator, did not give up on me and rejected my beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when a regular teacher of history called me "the enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
In the spirit of shame, I admitted that "my parents had me brainwashed," and called them "old dorks."
The transition was short.
The last train in my career in Oxford was sentenced to murder my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and after five minutes my pursuers were gone.
When they left, I picked up my first trip to London on Saturday.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a joke and a trick.
But in the eighteenth year, no one should become the object of such abuse and intimidation in the school.
It is even more impressive that it was Oxford, which not only issued forty prime ministers of the Tower, but is still hidden for the unreputable reputation of the university, in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
On the Valentino exhibition: Master Shitya, which was opened this week in London, ABC will sit with Nati Abáscal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other well-known Italian designers
Somerset House, former residence of King Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital, is worthy of the exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the time of the opening of Valentino: Master Shitya, a three-fold retrospective exhibition, which combines more than 130 high fashions created by its "home" over the last 50 years.
"I love this door," he says with his constant Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of a story, the only person who is "Ill Senior" Garavani, but it could not be written without his named clients.
Valentino has always felt disappointed with a rare and distant peace of mind.
The first hall of this exhibition, opened before 3 March, featured personal letters and photographs on the signature of the most famous aristocrats, from the Princess of Salim Aga-Han to the Lord of Snoudon, including Mary Chantal, Prince of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social advantage: from the humble port from Voger city to northern Italy to the Kumira international “elite”.
Being in the royal court is nothing bad.
"Even if they don't wear their cigarettes about your big cover, as some beautiful pop-music stars do," says Baronese Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in Alpha and were good friends.
Valentino is an infamous businessman and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We're all very pleased to go to his castle in town," explains former woman "Hinni" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauty lovers of the Marella Angeli or Evgen Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mace, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valerie Majek mentions a charismatic model.
Once we went home to work with him, it was after a fashion show in Spain in Rome many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy.
The style of Valentino was everywhere - in every detail of his room, in her dress, in her food, in music.
"Every one of Valentino's guests has made himself feel important and loved," says the "top model", which began with the model in 1995 during the week of high fashion in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion, because his excavities are the current production of art," she concludes.
Parental advice
The life of Garavani is a story of non-observances, but of love with full respect.
He loves people with good education and high grades, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House's gallery was converted into a glass floor of 60 metres in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and should defecate by the floor, the "birthers" of the grass, which collects cedars from Valentino, such as the payment that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassius, the costume that Monica Whitti used in "night" or a shoe and leather that belonged to Emperor Fara Diba.
This publication features names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turnon and Taxiss, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Natty Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first love is "I can't forget."
I'll remember him very well.
These were wooden, rubber, yellow and jackets from the 1971-1972 summer collection.
"It was a gift he did to me," says Nate Abascal, one of the museum designers.
"I consider him to be the rest of his femininity, his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," added the former Georgian de Feria.
I love the flowers he uses: they have a lot of light and they "come" to his face.
Proportions are ideal.
Princess and legislator of the Patrizia de Jovampaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she went to Valentino.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I thought I'd have an age and a reason to hope one of his evening toilets...
The end came at the end of the '90s.
I bought my first pay from Valentino to put him on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lín.
It was a fine payment, with a suit, a "knocking" in the warehouse and without a brothel.
"It was a dream coming true," said Rodrigo's wife, Dr. Arrenberg.
"Valentino is equal to fashion, its passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocracy living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess Arenberg will keep her holiday payments from the model with "maximum caution" because the payment is not just a payment, it's also a collection of memories accompanying it."
"King" Modes
The large final exhibition at Somerset House - the wedding pay for her wedding with Paulus from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as its model is called) to produce this set of flowers of the elephant bone with an incrust, twelve different rounds and a four-and-a-half-metre sleigh.
According to journalist Suzi Manques, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the payment is a very high fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from high school".
For many years, Valentino has been the best representative of the elite.
The Cavaler of the Great Cross (the symbol of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavaler of the Work, the Order of Arts and Words awarded by the Order of the Home League, Garawani collected as much honor as any of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his calmness, calmness, his exact and unbridled appearance," recalled Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, I saw him back a month ago at the Orse Museum.
He's sitting behind the table with the chart of Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: Cavah-Ijena's hats
For four euros, Indonesian chessmen are at risk of life and health, putting 70 kilograms of grain on the top of the volcano on the hard stones
There are people who work for them - from them and others who work in the field.
Among them is Antonio Vijaya, one of the 400 chessmen working on the life of the winning series in the Kavah-Ijen volcano, located on the east side of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the serious gas rising from the Earth's depth is suspended in contact with the air.
From its huge shells, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, it places them in two bubbles, pulls them over its shoulders and carries them up on the rocky road.
Up to the height of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, it is only 250 metres high, but it is necessary for the disabled to take more than 40 minutes to take a sharp step, with the effort to maintain balance and to keep the road from falling and falling.
They know that one step that they can take can lead to their lives, as did a French tourist who was beaten a few years ago by the Kavah-Ijgen rock.
Cavah-Ijena chessmen earn 5 euros per kilogram of cheese they get
As they climb up, they walk along the road between tourists who photograph them as if they were surrounded by circuses and there are heavy carts up to three miles [3 km] to the weights that the mining company has heard above, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is about PT Candy Ngrembia, a company operating the volcano since 1960 and, better still, not to say, its employees paid 662 Indonesian troops (5 Euro cents) per kilogram of cheese.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euros) of petroleum products, since it is distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of spices, fibers, cosmetics, dynamism and even for the labelling of sugar.
"As normal is the transport of 70 kilograms, we employ about 46,000 pounds (3.8 euros) per walk," explains Antonio, who usually carries three daily transfers.
He spends three hours each and finally feels broken, but they allow him to dig up 138,000 euros (11.5 euros) to the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a pity for such non-human efforts, it is the second more that he would work in the field.
"The pay for the shocks is very high on local measures where 15 000 pounds (1.2 euros) are paid daily and two million euros (167 euros) per month's wages are equal to two million euros (167)," explains the driver who previously worked as a stoneman on the tourist island of Bali.
Its pay was 75,000 euros (EUR 6.2) a day and the area was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banjuang, a city near the volcano, which in Indonesia is as devastating as the sira: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are Indians, and brought her back to Yava to take Islam."
Anato asthma, he's drinking hard, he's always crying, and he's got his eyes down because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Antonio spent three years at risk in Cavach-Ijena, whose serum has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's drinking hard, he's always crying, and he's got eyes on the toxic gases that he's making up the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I've been working for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises more than an English-friendly one.
The young man who was punished for his life could be a tourist hero, official or port in the hotel, but instead he worked as a prostitute.
In case of a rough wooden hygienic with other carriers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the night, because the sire does not stop running at night when its natural yellow color turns into dark and glows in the dark.
Screaming the bells, Ando comes down to the crater, lighting up his way to a small foon attached to his box, which he bought himself for his money.
About 400 carriers carry rice with cheese on their shoulders with a bottom of volcano
Despite high income, the mining company did not arrange for the gain of the harvest for the economy and did not provide any equipment to carriers working on its account and with such losses.
In fact, they don't even get parts of 30,000rups (€2.5) for a photo collection, which, together with an entrance ticket of 15,000rups (1,2 euros), are taken by the guardians of this commander from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"It's a work for the Scotch, not for the People," said Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who spent three decades in the Cavach-Ijena since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he is confident that he will be able to work as “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sira burns its throat and throat when the wind suddenly changes and catches the sugars in the flat tubs of the volcano, they are so persistent that no one complains about their serious illness... are more serious than their normal problems with breathing, arthrosis, bone pain and swelling on their shoulders, which have deteriorated under the heavy roots.
Balancing the crown on the back, Uninik can now raise only 50 kilograms in its 53 years of age.
Each day he and his companions bring 15 tons of volcanic cheese, which three truckers carry to a warehouse in Tamasari, over 18 miles [18 km] across a narrow grasslands.
"I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says the Uninik, a wide open mouth that doesn't cover a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30 years, he also works as a serial transporter.
Time is running out, but poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: human maladies from Kawakh-Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans are accused of career, stress and housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm the husband of the patriot, you're my wife's patriot, we're going to fulfill our civil debt, and we're gonna make life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of the mesh advertising, but despite this -- or perhaps because of this -- this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of the recipe that uses local talks such as "Let us put a ball in the box" to laugh at the birth level in Singapore.
The advertising agency that did this video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in a pleasant way.
His creative director, Douglas Gamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to fulfill his "national debt".
It's just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are ashamed of ourselves, so we felt that this is the subject we should address.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot, such as to engage in ghosts with pheromones or to organize fast evenings (climbs).
Many of these ideas may have been creative but did not necessarily work.
So we wondered why we should not do the most creative thing we could do to solve this problem, that is, to create a recipe?
1,2 children
Those who do not understand this so easily are the Government of Singapore.
It costs $1,300 per year for policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservativeism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
It was the last time it was under 2. It was known as the rate of replacement in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office for Married Couples and Families of the National Population Administration, says that this is due to "advanced education" and "more broad range of career opportunities".
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options for living goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and the creation of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of births and the separation of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at the sharp increase in immigration in order to counter the population ' s decline, calls for a return to the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that promote easily hidden xenophobic practices against many new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are critical of low-level pay and unwilling to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party has had a severe result in elections since independence last year.
After the elections, an attempt was made to address the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical costs and immigration policy, Singapore's example also has some unexpected effects.
The Government is making efforts not to build such a small apartment.
For example, this has begun to affect the mobility sector.
The urban development guide has been controlled by the number of small rooms known as the "cooky deck" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well-selled in the area of 46 square meters.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to a poor way of life and lose the incentives of the builders who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, director-General of El Developers, says that their "both boxes" are sold much faster than the space samples.
They are more popular in the sense that such rooms are sold for a few days, even a week, faster than those of a larger size.
As a result, our income is increased.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules gave clearer guidance to the contractors who had previously been subjected to opposition if they wanted to offer too many small rooms in the project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, following a discussion with Singaporeans working in the financial quarter of the Centre, it appears that they will not have any special effect.
"People are too busy, they live expensive, as well as education, and that's why many people take it off," said the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women refer to their career, the stress and prices of housing and education as reasons for bringing up children.
So as the Government has not tried to encourage its citizens to have children, with regard to abortion, the last word remains behind Singaporeans.
People online - People online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is about the property of a private or "personal life area which has the right to protect from any interference".
What is personal for a 16 - year - old?
How does he apply this definition in his everyday life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers posed by discussion on the Internet of situations that the creditor would not share on the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five children between the ages of 10 and 15 who were part of the network.
In four cases they associated the term "something very mine" in the privacy and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets would not be loaded in the mail," says 10-year-old Horghe, when trying to explain the importance of a person on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know them, but not all the world," he says.
On FB I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures from the game.
I'm also having fun with my famous ones.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine or someone who was driving me stupid," he says.
A boy realizes that it is wrong to publish a wide range of photos of people who are overwhelmed by crime or to write offensive or cruel comments.
Horhe believes he knows 35 friends he has in FB and nine of his fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mom's in the course, she's got a password for one of the accounts.
I called Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to other relatives or my friends faster," he says.
Without thinking, he replied that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't think of anyone who'd recommend him to an unknown.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This youth has open account records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and he recently admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they're going to give me or demand me, I'll just get them out of my account book," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
I don't care about the boy's experience today as a cybermobile.
One of my best-known friends had a chance at social networking.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't even know who it was," he says.
The victim, José says, didn't remove the account.
"Just included confidentiality."
He then explained the follow-up of steps to establish the record in a safe manner.
In contrast with Horhe, this boy would load photographs of the familiar or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like it or if I wanted it.
"I wish I knew it was cybermobbing," he says.
Key issues
Marelius Porras, an English and specialist in education and education, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has appeared as a means to search for information, but the rules of the game have changed with these sites," she notes.
Porras indicates that academic Mark Prenski, professor of pedagogical studies at the University of Yell and author of the work of the Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, has chosen these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who need to be taught, while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that this subject is difficult, "because we ask them to have certain criteria that can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at an age when adults are not enough to do so."
"So that they may be selective, while most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality is for children and adolescents to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this, it's useless," she adds.
Then Porras listed some options: There are things you wouldn't tell strangers, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like it if they published your photo of the kind of person you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign a picture with dinner, do you ask others to note them?
And yet, do you need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they should go online just as they do online.
She did the same thing.
“A person outside the Internet is guided by respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as by social networks,” she claims.
Illusion
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networks policies with a good heart.
Each item is understood to have good grounds for discussing with children the benefits of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gauridia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson “not to talk to strangers”.
The UNASUR Summit is concluded without the publication of the Lime Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lime Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the mandatory family.
Efe has repeatedly tried to obtain access to a document signed at the VI regular meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Office of the President have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after closure but have confirmed that it will be published at a certain time on the Peruvian Government website.
On the matter of the text, they indicated that the contents were presented by President Pierre Olyant Umala during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit was always limited.
During the day, only a video of the Presidential Assembly was transmitted to the press room without a "closed meeting," and the sound was banned.
A number of information circulated among the reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting but not by Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which resulted in the disappointment of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media, who requested more information.
The administration of President Peru subsequently sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was about the Umala statement, not about the official document to which the summit ended.
In October Peru adopted the III Summit of the South American and Arab States (ASPA), and this time, despite the urgent demand for this press, the so-called Limese Declaration was not issued, which had previously been declared.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had sought to ensure the transmission system for all journalists, but had limited access to information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to take the audit of the Hague Court, which resolves the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyant Umala and Chile, Sebastian Pinier, met and ratified the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in the Hague to hear statements from both sides, in the context of the charge against Santiago.
“We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences we are presenting in this international court,” said Umala, along with her Chilean colleague.
“There has been, and will be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals”, Pinier added, and welcomed the wish of Umalu on the front of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice took place soon after Colombia challenged this week the Divine Covenant, which it acknowledged to the verdants of the International Court of Justice after the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The summit was absent from the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011, after his former President Fernando Lugo's impotence, did not attend the meeting.
The host President, Olanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, at noon on the Limesian Time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and approved for action on 31 projects among South American countries, an amount of $17 billion was expected to be invested.
He mentioned among the agreements adopted that UNASUR countries would take "the important steps towards South American citizenship for which we are extending the settlement agreement".
He reported that action was taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil disobedience and organized transnational crime, to increase access to drugs, to low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the overall and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a three-phase basis, but should serve to increase our productive base and provide for a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve South America's relations, particularly in the woodland and border areas, by bringing our countries together and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a read-only statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned five of Peru's areas and limited by overcrowded persons in his territory, from the border to Brazil, and two of them aimed at greater contact with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also undermined the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its re-integration to the South American Union," from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united and to have a good relationship with its neighbours was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's President, Juan Manuel Santos, said that before attending a regional meeting, he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortegoi, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectable form on the sea dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice in Bogotá.
"Saturday (Saturday) may well meet with President Daniel Ortegoy," Santos said.
“We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact, which will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we are dealing with this as much civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they will be provided for joining the new President of that country, Enrique Pénja Néto.
The Minister of Defence also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the last country's participation has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America must learn in Europe about the integration of civilization": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Raphael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of general citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, should be taught in Europe".
Korea, which participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, declared public television Peru that Europeans had “killed each other during World War II” and in other talks, “but now they are practically one father”.
It protected, in this context, the draft establishment of South American citizenship, which was approved by the States parties to UNASUR.
“The free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as it has already happened with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want us back in the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also appeared as a party to the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with a view to reducing the impact of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons never take on any obligations, and we, South Americans, otherwise sign everything.
"It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political refuge of Ecuador by the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanju.
Korea believed that it did not regret this decision because it did not give it its principles but followed its “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at its time “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradite in a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticised Swedish justice for having to come to his territory to question the alleged sexual offence, while "only Swedish legislation considers it possible to conduct it through a video conference that might be held by Ecuador ' s missionaries in London".
Korea has confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating Assang ' s physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived in our mission, but the messenger has told me that he has had a minor medical problem that is not serious," said the Ecuadoran head.
In fact, this is the risk of damage to his physical and mental health due to ingestion in a small area without the ability to exercise on air.
"It affects every human's health," he added.
Korea indicated that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assangu by the Ecuadorian Mission in London since June, through the guarantee of non-compliance that would allow him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that negotiations had been held in London to find a solution to the problem of kidnapping the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not have negotiations on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European judicial authorities, as Assanga, Baltasar Garson, is conducting several processes at various European institutions”, he said.
And he said that "If Britain gives a guarantee of non-performance tomorrow, it will end".
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and how it has done in other cases, will ask Mr. Assanga to serve in Ecuador in London or ask him about Skype, tomorrow the problem will be solved.
Korea used the case to prove itself a defender of freedom of print and stressed that it would not tolerate “directness, incompetence and lies that would show freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom to print these are not hate crimes-political, but evil journalists who support life, chance and demand," he said.
In this respect, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists nor "bankers nor bourgeois hegemonic countries are not in Ecuador" and added that, being reelected, "will deepen the revolution for further development in the right direction".
Korea also supported the decision to retain the flag of Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the following elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not stand up for opposition and support for changes under mutual law" because "it has actually destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President decided that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos would "really justify" his desire to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the Hague International Court of Justice, which was in favour of the Nicaraguan sovereignty.
This decision is not respected at this time.
This is the problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process their communications in order to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the sea-border dispute that was held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it was right for Latin America to call at international forums if two countries were committed to making a decision, no matter how difficult it might be."
With regard to the opportunity to vote as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador to vote for a third term, he indicated that he considered this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult”.
Korea believed that if it won the elections in February 2013, it would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in the authorities, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be addressed by the political authorities.
"My political movement thought that I had guaranteed this possible victory, so it was necessary to recognize this responsibility," he said.
If we win this would be my last term in presidential office, and then we'll get out of public life.
If I lose, it's the same.
"This is the solution," he confirmed.
Korea also mentioned a new course of Venezuelan President Ugo Chavez ' s treatment in Cuba.
I was just talking to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he was going to the treatment that had already been planned was routine and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the deterioration of President Chavez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in Lima at the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today - the result of post-diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when he was informed that his AIDS analysis had a positive effect.
"I've been listening to you," he recalls that difficult though it's all a doctor's class, a moment.
Yunash threw it away from her family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know more about it, and his efforts were justified, and he had already noted his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio was one of the "old" HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) where he died in 1994, and there was no restraint.
He lives with the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at the age of 22.
Yes, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to apologize to him, "because he had a stroke".
In other words, at that time the presence of AIDS was a punishment.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it without compromising the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at this time is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, stated HCG Chief of HIV Division, Hyme Andrade Vilyanueva, who reported that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Vilyanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a punishment, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of immunodeficiency in patients at the start of their diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 is reported.
In other words, the above means that one who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "supporting control will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is true that 60 per cent of patients have died in the national database since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Halisko in 2011, and 187 deaths were registered this year; however, it is believed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral preparations since 2005.
- Why are there flight exits so far?
- It seems to me personally that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I imagine it's the case in our hospital.
As at least 12 years ago we had no medical shortage, the problem is that patients are very late because they do not know about their infected condition, there are late stages of illness.
He said: " Nine out of ten patients are coming when they have an opportunistic infection; it is necessary to make more impact on overall mortality, so that diagnostics are performed early, and therefore samples are needed to be found in the mass for all those who ask for it."
In its proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council on HIV Prevention in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, the kind of Fabricio who sought to check in the private laboratory only prompted him to do so and, despite his youth, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered a severe Cape Verde, a cancer that was one of the widespread complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're dying, and they don't want to know anything.
"Even if I die, I'd better go three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm good at asking, practicing, taking medication.
Today, only his parents know he's carrying cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I live an active sex life, but I have a serious responsibility to care for myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to encourage those who are now in the context of World War I.
Let's see if there's a risk of infection, let's know as soon as possible whether they're HIV positive, and if they're already diagnosed, let's know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
Its communication summarizes the topic of combating AIDS in 2012.
Can not open message
The great gap between health programmes and simple citizens is that of Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who was involved in HIV-related issues.
And it's the biggest prevention.
In the areas of this task, "the distribution of reserves has actually increased, one or two previously given us by one or two, now they are giving us hundreds of packages, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still have no access to the reserve," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why are they asking you?" The popular question, with eviction and condemnation, by social workers, school consultants, appetite workers and health workers who do not want to listen to adolescents, convinced the propagandist.
I propose to amend this ineffective distribution; that the condoms be not only after arrivals and that hundreds of them be in public toilets in places where young people often visit.
It's not a promotion of dissociation.
It is not about the payment of beer and motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked whether it was possible to provide spare parts under his direction.
"This is not sex, it is best to make condoms available to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisco
There were 13,435 summary cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State has a 4th national rating for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92 per cent of infections are related to sex, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to perennial.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision annulling the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes an annual precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has problems with payment capacity.
Procedures for supporting the survival of companies permitted by Mexican laws are said to be not to be valid in the country of sex and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In the practical area, the approval of Judge Harlin Hail's decision on 15 June in the north district of Texas ' s courts left vulnerable Mexican companies in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the part of Rio Grande.
The regulation, however, opens the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, giving evidence of three non-compliance.
As an introduction, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Banking Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the competitive production in Mexico.
The first paragraph means the abolition of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of transnational profiles.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Harmonization of International Trade Law was established as an arbitrator of the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the Verdit states that without an interlocutory vote recognised in the critical scale of the debt-producing debt that had been before the mother company of the Vitro branch, there would not have been a majority necessary to approve restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme was adopted.
There are examples of Agremex and Commercial Mexicana whose interdebt debt has been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that, by reading the votes of the branches, or otherwise by the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the United States courts, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, the majority would not be reached.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal has dismissed these data.
On the other hand, he accused Vitro of a complex situation that had been faced since 2008, resulting in a serious economic crisis that had taken place in the United States.
As long as Gonzalez Sada's family company appealed to the Court of Appeal for the vote to come to its appeal, there were five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for approval will be submitted, which will require a review of the trial by the Supreme Court, in the case of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Most importantly, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the role of friendship curiae (the other court), which described the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competitions Act, signaling that he was exempt from compliance with agreements signed by both countries in order to link it with article 15 of the Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely, rules established for cases of intergovernmental non-payment which guarantee equal rights for officials and creditors.
A two-ship caramble: they're in Vitro and they're in the country.
General balance
In the light of the complaints lodged for several months by Mexicana de Aviación's trade union against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrad, who was charged with fraud management, the Union of aircraft has already discovered a bottleneck.
The Authority, led by Carlos Dias Chavez Morino, had only submitted a criminal case against the National Banking Commission and the valuable books charged with preventing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Public Prosecutor General on an operation carried out by an undertaking to extract from the trust fund F/589 Bank of IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be allocated to the purchase of shares of the Professional Managing Company.
As you know, Askarrag Andrad is the main shareholder of the Posadas department network.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
The group of local and foreign environmentals, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society, met at the forum at the Caribbean University, approved a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Basin of Insulated Country, with an area not far from the staff of 150 companies.
The former Canacintra was able to bring together the rulers of the south-east area to resist the monumental forces that had been leveled off the land of protected territories and posed a serious threat to industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government ' s refusal to provide an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan has signed a Trade Agreement against Corruption known as abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, this case has already been transferred to archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in a long-term perspective
In an effort to reduce long-term debt, without affecting short-term housing, Homex is placing Birjet certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identicals, with a proposal to pay a per cent every 28 days.
Competival appears in the light
Trained by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders of information technology, a competition with the trade name Competival only appeared in the light, its objective is to market software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The fast-paced basketball passenger Hector Hetin Reyes has been involved in this sport for more than 60 years and has been traveling around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And since before he was infected with brain bleeding in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sport for more than 60 years, as a game of small categories, a game of the High Baseball League, an authorized BSN leader with the Baimmon Cup and the President of the Federation of Baseball.
"I have played a lot of role in basketball during my life, including several times, as when I was president of BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during his visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bajamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful husband for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes's not overstated by making this ad.
The walls of his house, almost all the photographs and monuments collected along his long way, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he will save those who remember his way through the Covboovs from the middle of the 50s until 1982 when he was 15 years old in the role of a co- agent or contract agent.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most, because it had been possible to be part of the eight Cuban champions since 1967 as an agent, associate or leader.
It was many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I apologized to one in 1981, in the year of Jerome Minsi's debate in BSN.
Since then, it has continued to lead the "Cuco" Ortis, who was the great administrator," said Reese.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was here at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, growing 6'7."
"Do you want?"
And that was the start of Minsi, one of the best games in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who got citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsy had brought the Bamamon Championship, Gauss would have helped us fight another one.
I enjoyed the Covboies Championship with Gauss, but I was already away because by 1988 I had been appointed head of the Federation.
By then I had preferred to enjoy its achievements and achievements at the National Assembly.
I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during an Olympic Qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the 1990 World Championship, which we received the fourth place, was to be a bronze if not the Canadian judge who forced us to play the final game, Reeses said.
That team from the 1990 World Championship is the best collection you've ever seen?
She was among the best, just as she won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke up a collection of U.S. that was quite similar to what we had won at the World Championship.
Not only were Minsi, Gaussa, Ramon Rivasa, Fiko Lopes and Picculina (Ortisa), but also the youth (Havier) Colon and James Carter, Brothers Leon (France and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 1990s because of knee trauma.
The command, which may not have been the best in the personal composition, but which brought us the gold medal and great joy, was the commander of the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing games like "Kanito" Neves, Pablo Alice and young Roland Hurruitner, we won gold in spite of all the forecasts.
Who was the best game in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortis.
Its indicators on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level the way Piculin did.
And that's not taking into account his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arielle's work.
What do you think your main achievement in the federation is?
Participation in the most famous period of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s, BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to achieve, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponse play only in their own field and against other parts of the island's national playoffs.
Now the kids are traveling and playing too much, and it's too much.
At the very least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me satisfaction.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and watch basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Iqabel, which has always been with me.
As told by Larry Hegman
Larry Hegman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Urte (Tehash), became well - known for his main role as John Ross Yuinga, more known as J.R., in Dallas' teleserial, where he denounced a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oil engineer Jay Ar Yuinga in the Dallas television series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new "Dallas" season, died on Friday night because of the difficulties caused by cancer, according to a family statement made to The Associated Press by Warner Bros.
"Larry came back to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing a sign role, which he loved most," his family said.
Larry's family and most close friends were with him in Dallas on a Saturday evening.
Linda Grey, his wife's role in the original series and in the cycle, was in contact with Hegman when he died in Dallas' hospital, her representative, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, happy, kind, and talented, and I'll be very excited about him.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Grey in a statement.
Hegman had been diagnosed with paper syrup in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was found a criminal spy in the paper and transferred to a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hegman had acquired television knowledge because of the role of the right type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which was translucent by the NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changed when he met an attractive girl who was playing Barbara Eden and began living with her under one roof.
He was also the main staff of two comedians, who were often shown in the ephemeral, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included roles that were well adopted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But his masterly interpretation of the disgusting J.R. brought Himgman to the top of the glory.
The CBS Canal Dramatic Series on the Yung Klan and other staff in its vicinity was launched in April 1978 to May 1991.
The commercial slogan "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create a noise around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's personnel do not feel to be killed, produced international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in bookkeeping offices.
This has also helped to attract a serial record auditor at that fair.
When the response was received in the November 1980 episode, 41 million TV users looked at it and turned Dallas into the second of the historical review of the entertainment program, after the MASH final in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Kristin, who shot at Mary Crosby.
J.R. confused her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she was not taken out of the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hegman played Yuinga as a naughty charismatic corrupter: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful man who wanted his wife, Sio Ellen (Linda Grey), to be treated.
"I know what to be on J.R." Hegman said in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where honest citizen J.R. Young will be. "
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the hero of the original series, mentioned on Friday Hegman as someone "as big as both on and off the screen".
He is constant and constant for millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five episodes of the second season have already been completed and the sixth has been in production, the channel has reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement that it will be with the series after Hegman's death.
Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actresses and poet Mary Martin, who stared at such classics as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 when he married a lawyer named Ben Hegman.
He tried to make a success of New York's theatre scenes in the early 1950s and then served in the UK of England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist named My Axelsson and married her.
There were two children, Preston and Haydi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu, where there are many prominent people.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything I'd like to be able to cause or affect someone else in any way," he said.
After the paper was transferred, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who experienced fear.
"I will give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to operations, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's gonna be a little awkward for a while, but you're gonna be okay."
He also spoke actively against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course to study "The End of the World" begins.
Each week, students study apocalyptic events such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this seminar, when Professor Stuart Sharme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an inexhaustible assumption: the end of the May 21st "long-back" calendar, which was held by many people as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the disastrous hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the “long - term Armageddon”, and the growing conflict that swept away Israel, where Christian theories of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse is beginning.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic seminar of all," Sharma told students of the University of Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey) this week.
To analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had been all 30 days, was a really good time.
And remember, it's good for those who have the apocalyptic idea.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" at this seminar, theoretically the last in history.
At the Temple University, Deputy Professor Barry Wacker reads the course "The Media of Mass, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are analysing why these ideas are being spread over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios call for certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can be won.
In this month students analyzed the apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students that it's probably just as likely as possible and impossible," Wacker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, an associate professor of art and anthropology, joined to read a course called "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the “unexpected destruction”, students should learn, prepare projects and conduct final exams.
In Penn State, an examination will be carried out in the Apocalypse Act, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night in which the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The city ended in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with a high average ball that 35 students were enrolled.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the start of the seminar from people asking if there were any more places.
The students, in turn, believe that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to observe what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Haddonfield and sociology office, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Kamden.
And the apocalyptic idea of light or religion is just a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old psychologist and nursery student, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach you this," he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students asked - no longer talking about the professor - said that he believed in the date of the end of the world on 21 December.
"The first project affected May's prophecy, and in some way we deduce it," said Julie Zeglan, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple in West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is a apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has lasted for several centuries, where people have responded to changes in their environment, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to increase.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew any course about "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the provision of the above-mentioned forum.
We have a mercy from Pope.
He noted that for a long time the last days of the trial had been referred to, and said that if nothing had happened on 21 December, "the people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or that 21 December would be the beginning of a seven-year period during which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe on this date.
Some said they were going to go to the "end of the world" party.
"Maybe I'll call some of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old high school student.
