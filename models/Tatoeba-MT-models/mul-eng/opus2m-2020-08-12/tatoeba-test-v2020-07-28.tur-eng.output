Sami, he was looking for Leyla again.
I'm totally in a state of shock.
How'd you get my number?
What's Tom doing?

It doesn't matter.
It's not over.
You can't treat me like that.

Tom didn't let me help him.
Do you know what that song says?
Make it on the market.
We're going to dance.
He's a member of the Whiteball Club.
Think about your life.
This dress is too big for me.

We're almost home now, Tom.
Who's Tom talking about?
I'm learning Chinese.
You just did good.
He wasn't interested in Tom.
Who's benefiting from this?
I asked Tom if he didn't know my brother's name.
He can't eat good food.
It's a direct reception.
Do you know how a hot pink sandwich was made?
Tom's gone.
Gold is more heavy than iron.
Tell him.
When the Sunset Party will be set.
Absolutely!
This can be done.
We'll have dinner tonight, restaurant, close to where I work.
I'm surprised you're gonna take a dance like Tom.
I asked you to leave Tom alone.
How many computers have you got so far?
I love you.
I don't think they're teachers.
Sami was afraid to leave.
He's worried about the soldiers.
They didn't need any money.
That's not just reasonable.
Please take care of him.
No one's accusing you of a crime.
I heard you wanted to see me.
Tom thought about his answer very carefully.
You're here right now.
Tell me what you want to eat.
Tom left the door locked.
One just closed the lights.
The time of the game.
What do you expect to buy?

We have to keep going.
We'll call him.
Now we're friends.
Tom likes to speak French.
I wish you were here.
He'll run as fast as another class friend.
He's slowing down his disease.
Not all these books are useful.
Tom must've been back by now.
Why are we getting sick?
I'm pretty sure Tom can't do this.
What I'm telling you about him is for his brother.
Don't touch the trolls.
Maybe I shouldn't sell my law.
Some think he's a bad idea.
Tom told me you weren't sure you wanted to do this.

His eyes were full of eyes.
Do you have any idea what they're doing?
What do you suggest I do?
I never smoked.
We didn't realize Tom was here so early.
Why do you hate your country?
I've already apologized for her.
Communism is a system applied to the Soviet Socialist Community.
You won't regret having hired Tom.
I slept on the face.
I missed Tom, too.
You can't take back the time you've spent.
Tom put his head down and looked away.
You want to see the room?
What they wrote about him in the newspapers is shocking.
He sat there holding his arms.
I was very suspicious.
Tom saved me from a big pain.
I'm not used to this kind of treatment.
The air was very cold.
He didn't know what to do about his mother's son.
I'll have him by the end of the week.
Tom took the ring and put it on his ear.
Tom sat on the driver's seat.
It's a good day, isn't it?
Call me tomorrow morning.
I came to you because I wanted to help.

I'm sorry, but can I ask you something?
We need to get rid of him.

I have to figure out how much I'll spend next week.

Tom, who I've been working with a lot of cars together, is a salesman.
I'll see you later.
When do you expect us to do what?
I'm sorry it's not a "normal" word.
Everyone's calling me.
You and I are not like that.
I wasn't expecting to win.
Turn left and it's your last home on your right.
Tom told Mary she couldn't live forever.
The machine's so hot that it's so light.
We're all alone.
I hate love love.
The idea is baseless.
Well, it doesn't matter.
You won't be able to help us.
I wish I could sing as good as Lady Gaga.
I heard Tom didn't get too much.
I'm aware of the effort you've put into this project, and I'm really taking it off.
It's Tom who thinks we're supposed to get a ball.
I need to recharge the batteries.
I thought Tom and Mary were already married.
Any solutions?
I hit his ass.

You can't keep going this way.
Of course I'll vote for Tom.

Wait a minute, please.
I have to go see them.
I'll leave you alone.
You want me to believe this?
According to the people's stories, nine are alive.
Do you think she's still gonna be easy?
When are we going to Boston?
I spent my whole life looking for someone like you.
The pyramids were built in ancient times.
Do you have any leave in your garden?
Tom just did what he had to do.
I think Tom likes to hang out with us.
Nobody knew Tom was in Boston.
It won't be as hard as you thought it would be.
He threw a letter into the mailbox.
Where are you living in Helsinki?
I put all my personal stuff in a plastic bag.
It's such a great music!
I'm in the balcony.
You think I can talk to Tom?
There is no god but He, and Muhammad is His Messenger.
Tom never lied to me as much as I knew.
Tom, Mary's the only person she's ever been talking to.
You've had a good morning, haven't you?
Both Tom and Mary were killed.
I just want to explain.
What are you proud of?
We both know what's going on with Tom.
Tom didn't call me.
Show me something else.
I didn't know Tom was 100.
Everybody's fine.
I don't think Tom's gonna do it.
You only have to find Tatoeba in your own native language.
Tom left a message for you.
The guy with the key isn't Tom.
It's ruined a lot.
A gentleman paid for his girlfriend's lunch.
Tom had other plans.
People didn't expect it to be easy.
What happened at school yesterday?
I think it's dangerous for kids to do this.
It's not worth the price they want.
I want to get training in Arabic.
Shut up, Mary.
There are some performers that breathe in someone.
She speaks a lot of languages.
Are you planning on helping her?
Wait till you see it.
He's got only one friend of Mubarek.
Tom missed his friends.
I trust Tom.
Who wants to kill Tom?
I put three cups of tea on it.
The police took Tom's hand from behind.
He speeded up the car.
There's a hole around it.
I need to let him know.
He's just right.
Clara's been taking music classes for months.
He's certainly not a trusted man.
The accident ended.
How did you change that?
I'll do it daily.
His coldness cooled his friends.
I'm not sure that's what I have to do.
I need that soap left.
You're a driver.
Where were you when I needed you?
I realized that one of the names on the list belonged to you.
Tom went to school three years ago.
Tom and Mary both liked it.
Where did he get that crazy idea?
Tom finally told me what to do.
I'm a housewife with three children.
Mary's not playing with babies anymore.
I want you to wear this.
I don't want to look like a tourist.
Everyone stood up and left.
Please don't shoot me.
Which animal do you like most?
I ran out of the house feeling that the house was broken.
Tom was sent to the store.
Not now, when?
You didn't have to tell Tom anything.
A silence barrier prevented us from seeing each other.
Don't forget what I told you yesterday.
I've been forced to obey my orders.
He made a life-saving move across the river.
These aren't your cards.
Tom lives alone.
Mary kissed her baby.
You really want to move back to Boston, don't you?
I was there with him.
His ex-wife issued a court order to order a man to approach him more than 200 metres.
Columbus didn't know where he was going or where he was and he did it using the money paid by a woman.
Tom's probably afraid of Mary.
Honestly, I can tell you she's not me.
I haven't heard from Tom in years.
You never asked me a question and I didn't answer?
First of all, we have to decide on the name.
If you have faith in God, you will be able to control your hearing and enjoy a long life.
I did it right.
It's a ghost.
"How are you gonna get Tom off the police?" "I'll offer him money."
It happened three days ago.
I have to get you out of here.
That's supposed to be it.
Even if he knew he wasn't a good idea, he convinced him to do it.
He was always different from the other kids.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
We ate cream for coffee.
It doesn't matter if you stand against it.
I didn't eat the baby and I won't.
I'm a little full.
Tom got caught up in another planet.
Her father is the president of Greece.
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
This book has very good photos.
"Do you know anything?" "Of course."
This morning's meal was closed because of a family funeral.
Give it to me.
So far, I've been so sad for the first time.
We're all going together.
I didn't mean it.
What's Tom reading now?
Your chance is clear.
This letter is my only key.
Where did you get them?
Tom will probably not tell Mary you want to help John.
Can you answer me?
What else did Tom do?
The client's not always right.
Please come whenever you want.
It'll be a long night.
We also use regularjots to communicate with others.
The manager called and said he wasn't in school today.
We want you to explain your delay.
I have to control them.
We won't be able to protect this secret forever.
The people on the island were surprised to see five people on the island.
Tom's gone to bed.
Don't Tom ever do that?
I don't believe I'm wrong.
They were angry at me.
He's down.
I'd better do that.
That's ten percent of it.
Show them what you can do.
Tom's my baby.
We've been together for three years.
We're planning an internship.
Do you know who made your pasturine?
He's near the station.
I'm really ready.
I asked Tom what he'd do.
I finally did.
Mary's a fashion designer.
You should do it this way.
Is there a hotel list?
I'd say sometimes if I had two men, it'd be fun.
The stars can be seen tonight.
Tom's good at math.
I was so tired, probably because I ate pizza tonight.
He's not actually a driver.
I'm so happy to call you.
We're not there. The rain started.
Tom can't watch television anymore.
You have to pay more attention to what he says.
It'll be no choice but to accept it.
Tom's still working on it.
Robert broke up in the middle of his phone call.
It's worth a lot of money for me.
He's a student I learned English this year.
The news made her happy.
I think it'd be good if you looked at it.
He was hurt by his head.
I didn't tell anyone else.
Tom's a proud man, isn't he?
Xavier's selling avocados on the market.
You're not clostrophobic?
What do you think of this plan?
What are the sources of knowledge?
Tom's been shot.
We made a lot of mistakes.
I'll get it.
As far as I know, it's not the temple.
We'll be here at the end of this month for ten years.
They fought for their homelands.
He's almost always home.
Give Tom a kiss.
She's starting to be a baby.
I had to see you again.
That's not what it's supposed to be.
Tom's just an idiot's eye.
Can't you tell Tom how he's doing?
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
Tom didn't expect to take any time.
Sami didn't even know who Leyla was.
I just came here.
If it's time, I'll visit you.
And he planned to build a toilet on that island.
Didn't you have to go shopping with Tom?
Come on, eat some food.
What did your dogs do?
I'll help save Tom.
Tom left right after we got here.
I went to Tokyo yesterday.
We're finally on the right path.
I'm sorry, I won't do it without a condom.
I didn't go anywhere yesterday.
He's not watching TV right now.
What's going to happen?
We've got to do more than that right now.
There's always a bucket of water under your hand if you're hungry.
I think Malbork's great.
Hold on a second.
I'm really happy.
I did it very carefully.
I don't have anything.
Leyla, he tried to defend Sami.
The answer is definitely no.
Can you speak Latvian?
Sami was still sleeping on the couch.
How much do I have to design for work?
Tom went up to pick up the question.
I have a great respect for Tom.
You were perfect for this job.
I want to investigate this.
Maybe I missed something.
There were two brothers there.
That's right.
Do you know what the heat out there is?
Let me tell you something.
I made some bad choices.
I've got a good life.
I'll dream every night.
He's faced an unexpected obstacle.
You look like you're talking.
Tom asked me if he couldn't hold his hand.
They don't know the rules.
I need to go see Tom at the mall.
What are your screams?
Don't bother me.
Didn't you take the lead?
The sinner called him.
I'm proud of this reward.
Do you need to help Tom?
That's not exactly what I said.
I'm always watching my movies as original.
I thought everyone here could speak French.
We thought you weren't safe.
Tom called the president.
Tom and Mary praised each other for their success.
I used one.
You and we, you and them, are human beings.
No one's stopping you.
The construction team started.
I imagine a crowd that's broken up in a fair form of service.
No one told me anything.
Berbers live thousands of years, and no other day has survived.
Tom's never on his speed limit.
I can take you in my arms.
Mr. Wang learned German because he wanted to work in Germany.
I don't think Tom's more than a kilo.
I know I should be here sooner.
Were you a high school populace?
You're gonna have to pay me back at that hotel.
Is there anyone here who speaks Japanese?
I'm just making my doll.
The city was full of wild soldiers.
It's time to close the door.
Can't you be there for a while?
Tom didn't seem as determined as Mary seemed to do it.
She's a dirty girl.
Tom wrote another book.
I'll definitely miss you.
Tell her to be ready to leave her.
I want to find my own place.
That's it!
Tom had no reason not to believe in Mary.
I promised myself I wouldn't complain about Tom anymore.
He said he was sick, he was a liar.
What do we buy him for his birthday?
I lost my son about ten years ago.
When she saw her wings, she shouted.
The train's been late for ten minutes today.
He's got his eyes on Tom.
You want to say something, Tom?
I wasn't expecting Tom and Mary to be here.
Tom was allowed to work because he was sick.
His death is near.
Is there enough food for everyone?
I like to listen to you when you talk.
I'm opening up a case.
I found my wallet I thought I lost last week.
The paradise of the world is where I am.
Tom's face showed his surprise.
You gave me the Van Horn.
Don't worry about him.
Don't be sorry, we'll find Tom.
You don't have permission to do this here.
Tom can really play good baseball.
There's something I need to know.
That's because he loves me.
You remembered them.
How many years does Japan have?
World War II began in 1939 and ended in 1945.
There's another one I know.
Tom made a few jokes.
Tom didn't get the book he wanted.
Detective Dan Anderson put Linda into a routine fake test.
He's using a truck.
Every box was full.
Tom knew Mary had seen French education for three years.
Dan didn't even hesitate to do it.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
I had cancer.
You don't have to shout as long as your boss gets out.
We need to stay after school and help clean up the class.
He's looking good at them.
Tom stopped smoking.
Tell him I understand you're worried about Tom.
Tomorrow's the market.
I found it hard to tell you what I said.
Will you risk it?
I didn't say Tom was upset.
It's made of copper.
The job seemed nice to her from the beginning, but then the driver came.
It might be bad for you to get a drink a day.
You're too small.
You worked with Tom before?
You're more lucky than me.
We'll have a little more chat during the season.
I thought it might be cocaine, but it's just a joke.
Tom found what he was looking for.
Tom's afraid people can smile at Mary.
Can I stay with you?
I'm confused.
He worked very hard.
You can't solve anything by crying.
I did everything I could today.
When was the last time you were driving a motorcycle?
German, Dutch, Norwegian and English; they are Cermen.
Do you like working in Boston?
Tom and Mary don't laugh now.
Do it yourself and do it immediately.
I told Tom that Mary was right.
I've already made thousands of expressions.
Tom was wearing a towel.
He wants to go with him.
The soldiers thought they could be home for Christmas.
He's always making other people.
You think I'm very materialistic?
When Mary kissed him, Tom became angry.
I'd better talk to Tom.
Tom's voice was burned in the empty room.
Get Tom a drink.
I need time to think about him.
You look like you're having a bad day.
He'll be in Paris tomorrow.
The organ was old.
I asked you why.
You're definitely too sleepy.
Tom never did a camp.
Tom never did that.
We're heading for Boston in an hour.
We're going where you're going.
Did you report Tom's question?
What do you have to do now?
The eggs give milk to their bones every morning.
Maybe we should ask a different question.
I'm eating breakfast.
I'm interested in sports.
It's just the beginning.
If you want, I'll teach you French.
Tom's got his baseball bat with him as a guarantee.
Don't be fooled by Tom's e-mail!
You didn't look like you wanted to do it.
I can be there in an hour.
Hi, my name is Maria. I'm 23 years old and I'm from Berlin.
Tom was acting like he didn't know anything about it.
I saw it in his eyes.
There's a lot of war in the compound.
Tom didn't apologize.
All the people I know love cars!
Let me hear what you have to say.
Tom, she's gone to Mary's house.
Tom and Mary are impatient.
I don't want the same thing to happen to us.
Someone should be treated with respect to the teachers.
The police found Tom's fingerprints on the door.
Tom took Mary out of the cell.
I don't speak French.
Don't wait for me to get out of here.
My parents told me that I was born into a son when I was thirteen years old.
It's Tom's money.
Tom feels unwanted.
I don't want to see him anymore.
Not to be a whore, but go to the market to get a whore.
He's a big boy.
He took note of what he said.
The group broke up early in 1791.
Tom died three years ago from high school.
About the intrusion she's documenting.
I'm sure he'll be tested.
I'm sorry about him.
Why is there so much violence in the world?
Tom must be here.
Tom does it sometimes.
Maybe Tom didn't want to disturb you.
Today is March 5th.
If I were you, I'd go.
Tom's good.
Tom showed me his room.
I'm interested in listening to music.
Tom wants to kill himself.
I'm not working for you anymore.
I don't know exactly what to do.
Now Tom's got a job.
Tom, I'm my brother.
I know you're all scared.
That's amazing.
In front of our school house.
Tom likes working in the library.
Please don't die.
Tom Mary's getting a nice cup of tea.
Tom came out to smoke.
A new railway bridge will be built between two cities.
I don't think Tom's going to miss the place.
They'll be model partners with heads.
I'm back to sleep.
There's pasta in the box.
I hate people who say it.
Actually, I don't know anything about these plans.
Thank you for having a nice meal.
Tom told Mary she should be ashamed of herself.
I can kiss Tom today.
My old boyfriend just called me.
I want you to take these.
I'm not a rat.
He told me he was against the plan.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
No matter how interesting you are, it's so good.
Don't touch my bag.
Why did you want to talk to me?
He ran away from the tree.
We have to get up on the couch.
Tom's making a bathroom in my kitchen.
He's been living in Kobe for three years.
I thought I'd do it.
My mom's crazy.
I don't have much more to say.
Nahuatl, the Astekler.
You're completely insane.
We didn't exactly do what Tom wanted us to do.
He's rich, young and beautiful.
I didn't want to make any noise.
We should not forget to post this letter tomorrow.
Don't play.
Tom had another job to do.
Tom's cousins came back early one day from his tattoos.
Tom gave someone money to help him move the piano.
You're not capable of doing this.
She decided to get surgery.
I lived in Boston for three years.
That's an opera monster.
I know she's busy.
We have to leave now.
Tom was not the first man to open Mary.
The police are asking him.
I'm lucky when I'm compared to Tom.
How can I feel comfortable watching me like this?
I know you did it.
We got some nice fish in a new microwave yesterday.
I hate this girl.
People got hurt.
Let's try.
When they got married, how old were they?
He brought the Book to the library.
I'll get out of the train next stop.
Tom's still breathing.
Tom and his family survived.
You won't cry, will you?
Tom never told me why he decided to be a teacher.
Tom and Mary are going to get married in the team.
Tom found an error in the last minute.
The spirit of the team was incredible, and we were all in it together.
I finished the wine and I put the butter on.
We're supposed to be moving according to the situation.
I didn't do it.
It was a terrible thing to say about Tom.
Tom was calling.
I'll see you guys on the market.
I'll put my passport back in the bank.
I saved it quickly.
Tom doesn't want to be a singer.
Tom reminded Mary not to forget to pull the phone in the bathroom.
The ship's technique is perfect.
Not if it's not for the sun's life.
Tom was much better.
Always be ready for the worst.
I think he lied to us.
Variate your investments.
Please keep an eye on me.
I need a favor.
I'm not as influential as you are.
I decided to be a doctor.
Tom filled the bucket with water.
I never felt comfortable around your family.
It wouldn't be better.
My sister's been taking off her shoes.
Tom's been playing hot again.

It'll take a while.
I'm sorry if I woke up.
Tom's car has a window opener.
Tom had a lot of money.
I don't like mathematics.
We decided not to do it.
Tom looks like a white man.
Do you have the last version?
I'm not an honor.
Did you tell Tom?
It was an accident.
Why is Boston such a popular place for tourists?
Tom has been studying French for the last three years.
I have a request.
One was beautiful, smart and funny, the other was stupid, stupid, and he was an intruder.
You're a high school student, aren't you?
Did they do it?
He killed his uncle.
I'm gonna go see if I can help Tom and I can't.
I've got a lot more.
This bird uses the sense of finding its prey.
There were some more things Tom's gonna say.
Tom doesn't have to help Mary today.
Tom must do the same.
I was never jealous of Tom.
I can see it hard.
When did you get married?
We all felt terrible.

Are you going to be at the next meeting this afternoon?
I understand both of you.
Tom and I often run together.
I don't even own a car.
Tom doesn't have to apologize, he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom agreed to come.
We can paint any color you want in your room.
I'm pretty sure it's all for you.
I never met another sinful man.
Did you open all the boxes?
I gave it to them yesterday.
Tom's probably gonna be jealous.
According to Dan, Linda insisted.
After work, I met Tom.
Until Martha was cold here.
Think of it as a warning, Tom.
What did you see when you were in Boston?
I didn't really love her.
How do you know that, Tom?
He waited patiently for her.
I'm tired of being sick.
When Tom came here, he decided to fly.
Tom was supposed to have a lawyer.
Get your hands off your back.
Everyone here calls me Tom.
Do I have any fear?
She's in the bag.
How many more hands do you have?
"It's gone." "What time is it?" "It's nine o'clock."
I'm going too far because she's healthy.
Tom couldn't answer my question.
Tom knows them all.
It's a bad habit.

The new army has been withdrawn from the country.
We need to know what's going on.

That university was founded by Mr. Smith.
Why do we read French?
What do you give Tom in exchange for?
The plane's been late for bad weather.
I'm sure you don't want to do it.
We can stay somewhere.

How many more?

Could that be Tom's great chance?
We're sorry you sold this house.
Mary had no idea why she wanted to do it.
There's nothing left to eat.
I know when I'll say enough.
We need to show respect for one's wishes.
I hate losing.
I think someone's following me.

What's the greatest difference?
You don't have to stay here.
He's a long way from Mary.
We don't have anything like this.
He's smarter than he is.

You're just gonna get it there.

Tom can come back.
The sky is clear.
Tom can speak French better than I am.
