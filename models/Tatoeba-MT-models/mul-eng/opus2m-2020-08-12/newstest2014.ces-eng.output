A black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money for repairs that break away from the remote network, many start to see a solution in a small black screen that can easily get into your car's driveboard.
The devices that monitor every mile that motorists are running, which transmit this information to the authorities, are the core of Washington’s controversial forces and state planning authorities to renew the old American main power financing system.
In general, rural design has suddenly led to intensive debate and the origin of the most diverse societies.
The Libertarians met with environmental groups and fought to enable the government to use these small boxes that would record captured kilometers and perhaps even where you are going – and then use these information to set the tax rate.
Thea party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of issues with privacy protection.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They shall find out how they can move within the next decade to a system where the driver pays for the mile after which he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already turned black screens, some of which have GPS surveillance, into testing.
This is a real need for our people.
"There is no matter where we can choose too much," said Hassan Ikhrat, Executive Director of the United States of State in South California, who plans to start monitoring the kilometres taken in each California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
That's what this technology is doing.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund is funded by the tax paid by the United States at the parking lot is on the ground.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will drive a lot more than a mile to one gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes even for one cent.
"The tax on petrol is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert from the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed a tracking device into 500 cars to test this system of payment per kilometer.
"It is from a long-term perspective as the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is not surprising that this idea likes urban liberals because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, which can help, for example, limit transport jams and create greenhouse gas.
The California projectors are affected by this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming legislation.
But Republican Bill Shutster (Pensylvania), president of the Transport Committee, said that it also sees it as the most long-term alternative.
The representatives of the Free Market from Reason Foundation are also convinced that drivers will pay for the mileage.
"It's not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Strategy in Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in 2011 tried Congress to issue a fee per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the conduct of the shadow representatives refused and did so because of fear of foreign legislators representing the population, whose daily life often means many miles of work outside the city.
However, a number of states and cities are proceeding ahead on their own.
The worst is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start the state paying taxes per kilometre, instead of gas taxes.
I don't know. The pilot project has already been completed.
New York's just a project to test.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight vehicles.
Coalition I-95, which includes 17 national transport ministries, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), discusses how they can implement this change.
But this concept doesn't have a stop.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped by the facility, drivers were concerned that the government is able to monitor each move.
"The issues related to the monitoring of the Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who led the management strategy and implementation of the Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its web pages: "It would be very easy to change this device to a fully-qualified tracking device."
There is no need to build a huge heavy technological infrastructure which is undoubtedly expanding on the record of individual outputs and revenues each day.
There is no difference between the few countries that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles the car will find, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
She brought some state agencies to small companies in California with the name True Mileage (actually captured distance).
This company was not originally involved in action with the aid of the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to move on to the emerging market with legal responsibility where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would get.
However, this device that is trying to capture the attention of the network designers because it does not use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly stored using the modem.
"People will be more willing to go if you don't follow their speed and their position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programmes, a number of major errors have occurred.
There's a lot easier and less painful ways to do it.
In Oregon, projectors experiment with drivers making a choice.
They can choose to use GPS or without GPS.
Or they must not take any facilities and instead decide to pay the passenger fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all citizens of the state.
In other places, it is hoped that the public will be able to access this concept, if the facility is capable of more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay for parking hours in addition to providing insurance under the kilometres taken and to collect information about the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"The motorists will be willing to engage in this because of the value of the benefits they offer," says the city's project paper.
Some transport designers would like to know, however, that not all the issues of payment per kilometre are just a major problem.
Officials of the Metropolitical Committee on Transport in San Francisco say Congress could easily solve the problem with the Banked Railway Trust Fund, which is very simple to raise gas taxes.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not need much fuel, so they will pay fair dividends.
"There is no need for any radical operation when wealth is sufficient to take up aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Public Affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their own privacy and many other things.
For the ČSSD, Sobotka will be united.
Social democracy is breaking up, people and babies are talking together and getting together.
If social democracies take place within a few weeks, they will sit at the same table with perfect buried partners who are on board a list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
Then send out the ČSSD either to collect the acidic coalie threats, or to the government of the riverless government.
Bohuslav Sobotka, after four days when he was on a loose sympathy, first discovered.
Yesterday he was not allowed to rule a political gramme and, above all, to bring out a certified liar for rejection.
Only he, the other members of the team, shall be authorised by the approved party after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEF).
I'm sorry about the members of the greme and now the citizens.
He's not lying, he's not in his personal life, he's not in public.
"It was a mistake," he said after dealing with the most southern leadership of social democracy, Michal Hashek.
He added that he was not at the position of the First Vice-President.
"I will send my decisions to the CFSP on 10 November," Hašek said.
Similarly, the Vice-President of the ČSSD Zeděk Škromach and the head of the delegation club Jerony Tejc spoke.
However, he warned that he had been selected just two days ago.
The two Members then announced that they were doing everything they could to make the 10th ČSSD club take one vote.
"I've been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I've always been loyal to her character and respected the decision of the foreign authorities."
Another lie in direct transmission.
Or did the Serbian SVV forget, when calling for Sobotk's rejection and his withdrawal from the joint team, that 57 per cent of the Serbian SVV insisted that Bohuslav Sobotka was a party's candidate for the prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, by calling the U.S.V. until the next Sunday, made a powerful enemy of the army.
Its opponents have ten days to carry out e-mail 192 members of this body and media to discover the most diverse strains and strains, possibly reminiscent of the actual errors of Sobotk's political career.
There will be a hard work of spinal cord, the signs of the dark connections between the Odhobared Baku and the Sobot wing.
There will be a friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotky and the influential attorney of the Pokorné Council.
There are disputes within the ČSSD Association of South Moravia or the ČSSD.
The words of the island's prime minister and Sobotk's friend Petra Kianara are cautious: "I signed the Charter 77 so that the country won't be ruled by idiots."
If the U.S.A. had already arrived this weekend, liars would probably have been brought to the ritual sacrifice of their functions.
The traitors are gonna blow their head off the ground, and they're gonna stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will then finish with the look of Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Soci: Communication with Russia is urgent
His mouth's jaws mean an infamous smile and then only deep breaths out: "It's terrible."
Cooperation with the organizational team of Olympics in Sochi 2014 is much more complex according to Martina Doctora.
We can forget about what happened on the past Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," said the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What's going on?
A lot of things work less and less.
It's so boring.
They are relatively fast from the fact that information about basic things is no longer available.
Maybe we're gonna spend three months with them to give us how to officially mark each village so that we can do the whole set of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
All right, they're still communicating.
Is there at least a delivered Olympic village?
But it's no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we went to empty places.
Homes of happiness stand.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need any finals?
It's just a basic concrete, so that's how it was before a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's danger that we'll be there on January 26 as a couple, it'll still feel nice there.
And if they don't, what's going to happen?
President Putin would you think he'd put an army in there?
That's exactly how it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Circle = the Poetkins Circle.
They're probably afraid they don't reach, for example, road repair, they don't make any details.
Maybe they'll have to have a trip in such a way that we'll have to take with us girls from London's heroes.
But I believe they're giving it to the shop.
How many Czech athletes could she go to Sochi?
Now they're broken 78, even though this number changes depending on the nominal criteria.
You know, maybe the cruisers are going to go to the three they've gone out.
No one can doubt about the fast-roller Martiná Sábilík either, but it's in development.
Still waiting for you to go to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
As they look like houses in the Olympics, we know.
We've even measured some things by ourselves so that we don't just believe in plans.
We're also preparing a whole series of other things, including transport.
And what does the boss do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus making a regular agenda for communication with the organizational committee in Sochi.
Putin promised the organic Olympics, his plan went through many secrets.
Winter sports fans are already climbing the meter to start Olympic games in Sochi, and others are looking for more and more concerns on their preparations.
The Russian Olympics, to start in the basement, are still dealing with another scandal.
According to the Russians, it is not possible to fulfill the promise that the preparations and the riding of her will not affect at least the nature of the Krasnodar country at the time of the invasion of Kavkazu, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will be present.
Recently after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high position, Canadian games recorded the history of the Olympics as the most important to the living environment.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to arrange games with "novel waste" has long been behind him.
Reporters of the AP agency last week revealed a wide range of building materials in the district of Achštyr not far from Sochi.
Thus, the stock of complete building materials, pneumatics, canisters and insulation pens were already found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities broke down and the warehouse disappeared.
Just for a second.
Last week the reporters were given a look at the stock of three football matches.
It's not the only place in such a place that several times, the British paper The Times described it.
On site are Russian railways, state monopoly, which is building a 40-kilometre road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
One of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Jakunin, has already led a total of 280 billion rubles.
In August, the railways defended that the warehouse had been built by one of the subcontractors.
Local people are already confident.
According to the people of Achstyru, all three months of the day and night the cargoes of waste material are running full.
According to experts, waste pollutes the local Mzymt River, other rivers and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here is contaminated by codifications of water for the next ten to fifteen years," said the British paper Vladimir Kimajev from the EWNC Ecological Non-profit Organisation.
The illegal stocks are not the only problem of the Russian organisational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison: Games in Soci will be $11 billion, while the annual Olympics in Beijing 2008 went to 43 billion.
London's games in London were only 19 billion and the mentioned nine billion Vancouver.
In addition to corruption scandals, project maintenance and fear, if there is enough snow at the end, reports have also been made that human rights are not being respected when it comes to the exhibition of sports facilities and infrastructure.
Last month one of the workers opened his mouth to protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also afraid of how Russian organizers are dealing with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors tend to support Russian gays on the Olympics.
A young couple grew up in a home with their parents, a new house offers private homes for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been commissioned to design a house on a piece of land that lies on two streets, some of which are covered by the land itself.
The request continued to say that there will be two generations in the house who would like to live together, but everyone should have their own clear separate space.
The younger couple needed more than a small office.
The house stands on two streets and peacefully en route to the surrounding land.
The architects therefore decided to place every household in one of the homes.
"In the design of the proposal, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are interconnected by several roads through the outside of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The home of the parents is at the level of the gardens with an old borough, where family traditions and memories are considered.
The individual parts of the house are easily identified outside, however different from the different final repair phase.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, its surface was made with panels from wood, part where the office is located is covered with white and the remaining elements remained in clean concrete operation without any further adjustment.
Many walls of the house are completely obliterated, thanks to which the interior of the house is very occupied with the outside.
The home of parents, more precise kitchen, food and shelter, includes a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The offer of interior with outside supports the side wall, which begins on the floor and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space at the young couple's house.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall and then walk through the stairs into their rooms.
Just the stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their design allows them to pass through them a lot of natural light.
That's why the architects tried to separate the house from other people and to impress him with something unique.
The young couple's home is shared as an open room with kitchenette, dining and living room.
From the terrace, she just splits the wall with her door open.
Living area with food and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that passes freely on the terrace from where it is a beautiful view of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The single office in the highest descent is wrapped in a clean white and black combination.
The warehouse is a dominant part of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the main entrance of the house, appear in the entrance hall and then walk down the stairs.
Protect academic freedoms, pay for Earth and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, pedagogicals and middle and high schools in several countries to protect academic freedoms from the campaign against vote by President Miloš Zeman at schools.
I met with more or less success.
The director of the Massary University in Brná, who refused to give a speech by the honourable President of the SPOZ - Zemanovici during the pre-trial period, even received replies in the form of no invitation to the celebration of the Czech Republic's State wedding.
Here is a list of representatives of schools that were no longer so state-owned and were able to visit Miloše Zeman: High Technical Education in Brná, Gymnasium Coldov in Ostrava, High School Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Koliná, J.E. Purkyný University in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubic with the continuation of the policy process at high schools.
A new elected Ambassador for ODS, thanking the Faculty of Electrotechnologies and Computer Sciences of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic functions and it seems to him to be normal.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you'd stayed, for example, in the care of a smaller city.
Do you want to join the ČSSD Heitmans who are currently performing the function of the mission and the Heitman and as well as degrading both calls?
That's what you're saying to people that they're able to control both of these side-by-left functions.
I know, here's the example of Michael Haszka, who even manages several dozen functions at once.
But it's probably not the same example of the person you should be dealing with.
We will also find the wrong and positive example of MUDr. French Steppers, who would rather have left the post so that she could be fully engaged in the management of Pardubice.
The main reason I recommend leaving the thank you function is, however, that in the course of the function you are going to break the apolytic ground of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubic ODS sees your current influence on both posts as a benefit to the University.
However, you will be able to help your "Your" school without being grateful.
I think that the same view as I have and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your stand and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be told that your loved ones are counting on you in the next elections.
And it doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovic bubbles, chemicals don't touch it.
More than a thousand tons of oxygened greens want to be produced in the next few months in the Slovak Fruit of Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé Food Group.
This season began in October and lasted half a year.
Since 1925, health care has continued to be produced in a traditional way and thus directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rareness.
Our workers will find a change of nearly ten-kilometre route.
To each of the ten tanks goes into 15 to thirty tons of iron, the completion of one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovena Fruta David Kladroba.
Heads of the wish drive to the area of the company directly from their fields mainly from Ostrožska and Bréclavska.
The fruit workers then clean the green, remove the costs and go home to the crochet.
From here the already-grown greens fall into pools of six-foot deeps where they work in white clothes and dolls.
That's why they're enjoying the undesired air.
The last mixed species of wants are covered by the platinum and water is difficult.
"The green crayon then appears six to eight weeks after spontaneous milking without any addition to supporting pollutants," pointed out Director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production under domestic conditions, individual types of workers supply salts and minerals.
He wants to go to the full line after it's done.
He is afraid of falling into the left-hand pockets or glasses and is told by the sterilization.
Hamé provides acidic wants in particular to the Turkish and Slovenian markets.
His interest is also recorded in some other countries, such as Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "co-operation" with Germany in connection with monitoring by the United States
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence officer, announced his willingness to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German Ambassador Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was assigned asylum, and talked to him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who delivered the press on Friday in Berlin, he says: "Because my efforts have been clearly positive, the government has continued to deal with opposition as if it were fraud and attempts to criminalize political demonstrations by serious complaints that do not give room for appeal."
Speaking the truth, however, is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to be charged with criminal acts against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Justice Ministry include spying and stealing State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the German officials, we will find a way to do this."
The tension between the U.S. and Germany began when it became apparent that NSAs were listening to Angely Merkel's phone call.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the Parliament chairing the parliamentary panel which is responsible for the report, said that if there were any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without risk and that relations with the United States would be completely destroyed," it should be done.
Mr Ströbele, Parliament's envoy for the German side of the Greens, published on his Twitter contribution a photo on which he is with Mr Snowden.
On their way to Russia, two German journalists supplied it.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to former NSA law, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left once.
If Mr Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would have needed assurance that he would be "safe", said a member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he had faced a vicious and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that led him to leave home.
He said, however, that the global response to his "political expression act" gave him renewed courage.
The general public and senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the deployment of an unfavourable system of universal public service monitoring.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved."
Killing us is a shame, but we're innocent, the representatives of the Red Khmer.
Nuon Chea was the number two in the Rudny Khmer hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan was the former head of state.
For the governments of the Rudj Khmers, who fought between 1975 and 1979 about the mixture of Maoism and nationalism, life came about as a result of the exploitation, hunger, disability, suffering and repair of more than three million Cambodians, at least four quarters of the population.
To this end, the leaders of the S-21 International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia awarded life imprisonment in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, rape and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are proud to believe that they are in the best interest of the people and not toil what is the real extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and then touch and fix the situation," said Khieu Samphan in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is, I didn't have any rights," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered the Red Khmer cameras to "do wrong with people or kill them to heal them of food or cure them from genocide".
But he admitted "the moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victim, their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Five-year-old Bin Sivla, who came under the Rudny Khmer regime for eleven visitors, said the AFP agency could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"Just wants to be forgiven."
"It'll be gone," she declared.
"If he hadn't issued orders, his device wouldn't have been killed," she added, "the leaders of the Rud Khmer are worse than the monster."
Before the trial, he was also the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Ieng Sary regime, which died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, former minister of social affairs, was in September 2012 looking for an incapacitated process for dementia.
The leader of the Rudj Khmer Paul Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay for manual charges
Frontier Airlines plans to calculate the amount of up to USD 100 per tonne during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US$ 100 for a handicraft and US$ 2 for a coffee or soda, although in its notice in the middle said that passengers will be able to leave their entire luggage.
The new deal for the handhold is related to the deal in the upper position space, so the small deal under the seat will still be free.
Frontier says it will account for $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if they are travelling with payment waiting until arrival at the port.
A spokesman from Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a hundred-dollar fee has an incentive to move forward with payment.
"We would rather choose this fee," she said.
Air carriers started to pay the first and second commitments in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these fees and went into the handbags hidden in the spare space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in that area.
Payments are one of the ways to learn how to take less on deck.
O'Malley said that the meaning of this new fee is actually no more money.
The fact is that the most faithful customers of Frontier's company have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper secondary space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Travelers who buy flights on their websites will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier can bring an undertaking for which he does not pay anything, while the other passenger in front for the same undertaking will pay US$ 100.
O'Malley said that the websites and supply procedures will be adjusted to ensure that the travellers learn about the fee before their arrival at the gate.
The new payment of Frontier’s manual undertaking will not yet be in force before the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travelers often pay for holidays and other payments, but airlines love them.
He claims that the manipulatives are worth money and passengers who want to pay for this service.
Many on Wall Street take into account another commitment fee as a sign that airlines are trying to pick up enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not get paid for manual surgery.
The company Spirit Airlines was the first to pay the hand-holds three years ago and the other low-law company Allegiant Air followed her example later.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for the company’s manual undertaking Spiritit would bring $50 million annually.
Sorensen, former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spiritit and was surprised by what he saw at the gate when the passengers met with the extraordinary fee of Spiritit for the manual undertaking.
"Earth access was the most urgent thing I've ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I've been waiting for you to see your teeth and your fingers on the wall.
The plane was full, he said, "and the attack went deep."
The frontier also pays for coffee, tea, soda and juice after the company's model Spiritit.
The frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can leave their entire bakery and the coffee will be filled free.
Water will continue to be available free.
U.S. Airways tried to get paid for drinking in 2008, but after the difficulties that had taken place seven months later, no other significant airlines had found it.
The last of these Frontier companies to pay a handout, if the passenger does not buy a flight directly from this airline, is its last effort to direct customers directly to their websites.
Air carriers pay online travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD per flight sold.
This has enabled all airlines to move to purchase passengers directly from them instead of doing so through Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier's company has gone into this area as soon as possible.
In September it started to give customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile under the loyalty programme.
In the medium range, the dose per infected mile is 25 per cent of the mile from the road in question.
So the road to Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased via the Internet travel agency means a 250 miles fee.
The company also allows customers to choose before their seat only if they purchase directly via Frontier’s website.
Frontier's company has a loyal client base in its home city of Denver, but its company is beginning to die and lose money.
According to the financial results mentioned in the middle of the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, the market fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The Company of the Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier by selling this airline.
On the basis of the NSA website, it doesn't blame hackers, but it's "internal error"
The National Security Agency indicated last Friday that its websites had fallen for several hours last week because of internal error, never because of hackers' attacks, as some have claimed on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov parties were not available several hours tonight due to internal errors which occurred during the regular update”, the Spanish Agency stated in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be eliminated during tonight.
The claim that the outcome was caused by an attack by DDoS (distributed refusal of service) is not true.
Earlier this evening online photographers noticed that NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Former spokeswoman NSA ABC News told ABC News that the internal sensitive network of agencies was not “at all” threatened.
The speaker said no confidential information was at risk.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for distributing NSA pages through the DDoS attack.
DDoS flights are designed to fill target websites with information until the servers are in trouble and the site is not lost.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not found in the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA superintendent agency, which once received a review of no such agency, has been following the outbreak of foreign and domestic monitoring programmes by means of public attention, and the causal criticism of the secret NSA files from the agency and their expression by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy involving the agency led to an earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of targeted cybernetic operation.
The profits of Bombardier’s company were lost as a result of the drop in supply and order
The Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier announced in the fourth quarter a 15 per cent reduction in net profit resulting from lower orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier also did not publish any data on the flight test for its new type CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide any information on whether that aircraft is carrying out an ambitious plan to start commercial operation from the next September.
After the start of the pilot flight about a month and a half ago, only three times did the plane fly and a question arose as to whether the test phase is going well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the stock exchanges in Toronto decreased by 8 per cent.
The state bank analyst Cameron Doersksen reduced in the fourth quarter the “high-performance” rating to “sector performance” with the expectation that the storm will take place during the next quarter or two.
"As the less supplies of the aircraft were expected in most cases, the profit rate in the area of transport was very high," Doersksen told customers.
As the pilot programme continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries aircraft.
However, if there are no new orders in the coming months, we assume that there will be an increase in market surpluses against this programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that CSeries aircraft are being launched into the lower market area that now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was released in March and after a few months of delay, it was completed in the first year of September.
However, the number of mandatory orders for CSeries aircraft reaches 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to verify the company's claim for low-consumption and the cost of this transport aircraft.
Currently there are 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that when the first aircraft was introduced into commercial use, Bombardier would achieve its target of 300 mandatory orders.
The management staff also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is under way.
"The pilot aircraft did not stay on the ground until it was expected," said Beaudoin in the conference address and noted that the ground test and software update were planned during the departure of the aircraft.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate for the first year and then focus on updating and we did.
This will take place during the entire flight programme.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should be released in the coming weeks and the other weeks later.
However, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its flight implementation plan and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – although it is in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – will obviously strengthen our view that the introduction into operation will be postponed on the first quarter of 2015,” Doersksen said.
Of the 172 million USD or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier’s company fell by the end of the third quarter of September 30, at $147 million, or 8 cents per share.
The managed outputs for one share remained unchanged by 9 cents.
The trade marginally dropped from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system of Thomson Reuters analysts, 10 cents per share and 4.56 billion turnover were expected.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicated that only 45 aircraft were added to 57 aircraft per year before that quarter.
The clear orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Uncompliant orders in the airport division were created by 30 September 32.9 billion, which does not change until 31 December.
“The results in the airport were in line with our views, but the low acceptance of orders and the overall market position was distorted by us,” said Beaudoin.
Exports in the aviation industry amounted to 13 per cent to US$ 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the profit in this division increased by almost 11 per cent to 2.1 billion dollars.
Unfulfilled orders in transport were created by 30 September 32.6 billion, which is around 31 December of the marginal growth.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The Heads of Staff indicated that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The company’s share of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichette, dropped by 8.5 per cent on Thursday at USD 4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced a 10 percent drop in the quarter.
A law firm dependent on cocaine that protected the mafia from police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to provide information to the king of the world of Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A drug dealer who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would come off the record, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had then become suspicious of cocaine use, the head of the world of Neil Scarbrough to provide sensitive information on his research into drug use activities.
Lawyer whose review was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative, was arrested at home in 2011 after the police investigation of Scarborough, which was represented in previous drug proceedings.
The police watched Sarborough (32) leave three boxes of cocaine with cocaine at the law house in Blackburn, Lancashire, which was just at dinner with their colleagues from the Legal Society.
On the basis of the test at which cocaine rates were found in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information on the arrest of two men in the benefits of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were monitored at that time during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of police arrests held heroin and cocaine at approximately 1.5 million GBP together with 200 000 GBP in cash, 32 others ended up in jail.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals for fear that he would be dependent on cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors law firm with a resident in Blackburn, lived before the Liverpool Crown Court at a time when he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases after a three-week trial.
During the previous hearing, he admitted to keeping cocaine.
The law firm was born after a police investigation into Scarborough found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditto in February 2011.
Two suspect detectives followed him, recorded his entry into Ditt's house, and watched him put a 60 percent clean drug under law enforcement in black golf gloves.
Next he was Scarborough with Ditto, who was at the football stadium at Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer came home where he found drugs, and nine conversations took place between the two people.
The court found that the drug classes A were found in his hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular user" cocaine.
He was later arrested, but he stopped using cocaine and said he was talking to a suspect dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation belongs to "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took her money and tried to get out of her some credit cards, but all were held and her hair samples were taken.
At the police station, he said he was running the office both at his home address and at the workplace and that his clients visited him because of his work activity at home.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which had previously represented him to tell them what he knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else knows better than the legal representative in the criminal field that he should not abuse the law."
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a legal representative and of getting too close to the specific client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who uses his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations were certainly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation took as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his prophecy good news, but he destroyed it.
With some of his clients he got too close, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
He refused and declared: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I would like Mr. Scarborough's information, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away."
After hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself at the time he started getting drugs from organised criminals."
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the former representatives of the organised crime group, which had given him the task of collecting valuable information on police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of dishonesty and have public confidence and feel they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the back of his profession.
The unit for serious and organised criminal acts in Lancashire led Mr. Ditto's investigation, on which he was also sentenced for three cases of cocaine detention and now for the prevention of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the crime before the court.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that nobody is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand before our court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of conspiracy for the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and condoms.
The next thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta arranged an online conversation about himself, in which he said his work would be legally represented by clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner would wish Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for the work he had introduced inequality.
He agreed to rule with Klaus and Spidlo.
Now, Jan Kasala's men have been sent against Babish.
The people received only one-third of the social Democrats or UN representatives in the elections.
They enter the government agreement, but they enter at least one benefit.
In a team that has already begun to capture the images of possible coalitions, Jan Kasala - men, who were on board the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrey Babish don't have such a matador on their side.
This is likely to remind you of the first meeting in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how annual discussions will be developed.
Kenyan press charged with the controversial media law
"This is a terrible report and it is time to ask what Parliament is preventing in order not to simply ignore the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," said the newspaper, which considered the draft anti-constitutional law.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, director general of the Capital Group, which belongs to the CapitalFM, one of the most known independent voting stations and reporting websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be ignored because it is extended by the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star, the government actually submits "full control over the media" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "has been severely wounded" and criticises the bill as "probably".
The adoption of the bill comes through a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after an Islamic gunfire at the Westgate shopping center.
The anger of the Kenyan authorities turned to itself when it raised a security record on which the soldiers sent to the site of the attack were likely to deal with the luxury goods.
The chief of police responded by letting two journalists and a leading media officer call the audience, but the announcement was delayed after media pressure.
According to the new proposal, the media companies may be affected by up to 20 million Kenyan frauds and individual journalists up to one million combined with the risk of "listing" or may be denied official press accreditation.
The Court shall also have the right to enjoy the property of the defendant if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation list, “there is also one attempt to reverse most of the voting stations. ”
It is also noted that these measures may have a liquid impact on what is known as the Kenyan "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that when they shut down the media, they can do whatever they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the newspaper Nation Mutuma Mathi and described Kenyan media as a key source of mutual control and public life.
"When we leave it on politics, they will bring the country to the banquet and bring us back to the hunt and to the collection," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya were in the past critical of the public.
In May they voted for the destruction of the national air pollution agency concerned and for the renewal of their current payments of about 532,000 unpaid monthly shillings, which are so ranked to the world's highest.
He has to meet, he knows young Czechs.
Most of them, but not at all.
There's still more Chechnya giving money away.
However, they do not reach out to champions in competition in the region.
The most money on the other side is that of the Rakusanas who spend monthly in the average of EUR 181.
It's more than Chechnya's arguing with people in Slovenia.
This is reflected in a study by the group of Erste Savings Barometers in Central and Eastern Europe.
It has also shown that there is an improvement in the demand for employers, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to give more money to the party.
While the Czech Republic is still using very little mixed products in Romania and Serbia, there is a gap between the roots and the roots.
For example, almost every other Serb finds himself, according to a study, at home under a poster.
In Thailand this year, the number of those who have monthly higher rates increased.
Still loni per month for the most diverse kind of dispute ranged from a thousand to 2.5 thousand koruna 26 per cent of respondents, which is about five per cent more this year.
The average monthly contribution in the mid-year comparison, however, amounted to 2078 koruna.
The largest hit between the product cuts is pension insurance.
This prioritises 54 per cent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess the delay for 36 per cent of people.
On the other hand, the design of the construction dispute was very much lost during the last year.
You're using only 16 percent of the respondents, while the Loney was almost a quarter of the people.
The study also showed that although people consider it important to eat, most of them do not know what results are achieved on individual products.
In particular, young people under 30 years of age don't know how their money is paid.
On the other hand, the best information on the cost of their savings is the oldest group of people asked, among people over 50 years of age, 73 percent of those asked.
In an international comparison, the group of Erste Česi leads to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44% of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Rakusan with a 12-percent departure.
The UN celebrates new goals of poverty and poverty
The United Nations organization is starting to work independently on a new file of objectives that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which were introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began last night in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in spreading "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace MDGs whose validity was extended in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
General UN Secretary-General Ki-mun said last night at the summit that it is now time to "be more concerned with national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and carry out a process that will achieve the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDGs will take on the progress achieved within the Millennium Development Goals and will be a non-participating part of the development programme after 2015.
I am putting forth every effort to carry out my mandate by the Member States and to realize our vision of sustainable development, which puts MDG's success at stake.
The security concerns of Mozambique are due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the shadow of Samory Machely, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputa to raise peaceful voices at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of his country, he changed his business clothes for a shirt-adhesive letter in Portuguese and joined in the ceremony on Thursday for independence in the capital.
Two weeks later, almost daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the party to Renamo, some of the worst from the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous wake-up strike, originally supported by the White Government in Rhodesia and then by the Government of apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will again emerge in the country, but recent developments have caused foreign investors and locals to be forced.
In September, the economy is rapidly growing, as the discovery of extensive coastal reserves of coal and coal in the northwestern can be carried by companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and America's Anadarko, investment in value over $50 billion over the next few years.
The ruling party of Frelimo, a dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo is accused of being a source of tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has caused the last conflict by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional village of Strany Renamo.
The violent attacks of former rebels followed when the government forces came to power on the basis of Renamo's side and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, told the Financial Times of the spokesman of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accused of causing the Renamo conflict because it has been attacked by soldiers.
President Armando Guibuz has been trying to calm down concerns about instability.
Mr. Guibuza, for the French press office AFP, said in the middle that Mr. Dhlaka saw himself as a "expenditure", which he wanted to use "what remained of his power to prove that the government could make its own decisions".
Like Frelimo, Renamo says they want to avoid war.
But they grew up when Mr. Mazangy's words were quoted as saying that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
FT said he thought Frelimo's party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the meeting, but seriously," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between these parties have been conducted to ease the pressure between these parties, which have been triggered by a series of rounds this year, only a few.
It's a charm between two big personalities (Guebuza and Dhlama), said a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Not one of them is a good competitor and not one of them is prepared to take the necessary steps.
The Renamo side, which was about to change the vote, has already shown that it would combat the municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an incentive to obtain benefits and financial benefits from the government.
The voluntary part of the Renamo Party has declined since 1992, while the newest party, the Democratic Party of Mozambique (DHM), which was based on the former member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, whose second working period ends next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a democratic system more sides, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidential authority," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but he has carried out radical terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the refugees arrived in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred miles away from the main city of Maputo, but where is the city of Beira, a port on which companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, on their exports of coal.
In June Rio stopped for about a week using a train when the party threatened to interfere with this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to ask himself if Renamo's threat was spreading.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration from government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people also have concerns about corruption, slow development and recent flooding.
“People think that the country’s responsibility for the future is extremely important to the government and the president and that he must be the one who will find a solution to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"No one cares either about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want to have free access to the road," she says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life”, says the author.
The stories of Thor can show that "the rough force cannot be equal to the smart lstivist", while artificial legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large number of myths would be “too strange for school education, too scandalous and, in some cases, too extensive," said Crossley-Holland, who agrees to make a careful choice of work at the same age.
"I think it's great that myth and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been thinking about this plan for 20 years.
He added that "open teachers" authors and teachers are in short-term stories with "supported" message for children as "study".
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English the Beowulf era and who also writes the Norwegian Moments (Penguin Book) and the British National Girls, says: "You can have good ideas, but you can do better if you leave them for yourself."
Perhaps the greatest difference between the adult author writing for adults and the adult author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished by happyness, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil there.
And he must be aware of it; revealed by means of the story, never openly determined.
The old truth is that it's better to show than to describe.
The Brnian Star will take visitors to the universe in the new digital age
At first glance, it is evident that the world's largest planet has changed in the last half of the year.
There's a new bridge, visitors can hide in new comfortable seats and the project area of 17 meters above their heads in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the center of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the image perfect, there are several smaller projectors across the hall.
Another important part of the entire device is covered by the sand.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate an image," said the director of the Brnian Star Jiři Dušek.
The computer will ensure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but gave a complete opinion.
"The number of computers is thirty to forty times higher than in classical personal computers," said the star technician Tomáš Hladík.
The digitalium can use extremely realistic and plastic models of night skyscrapers, human body or bottom of the ocean.
They're so curious right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is the nearest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The star management plans to promote the purchased order and its own design in the room.
From Saturday, there's two rules on the program.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People learn about the training of cosmonauts, travel to space, rely on centrifuge, and then look at examples of how the ordering conditions of the astronauts in space face.
The second order is for the children and his name is Kouzelný tues - Kaluoka'hin.
It tells the story of the invasion by the pestrobaric inhabitants of a quiet life until the moment of the explosion of a small soybean.
A total of 50 million crowns, which was paid mainly to the Ministry of Education, remained gross.
Less than half contributed to the city of Brno and the star from its budget.
The project site stood at ten million koruna, a projector of twelve million.
"The rest of the company's audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building that the star passed two years ago.
According to Director Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could be reached by the end of the year.
We studied 11 thousand INZERAT!
We know where they want you to work!
In November of this year’s analysis, more than 11 thousand insurers offered jobs, 4300 of which were published in daily printing and 6800 insurers (62 per cent) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important medium for publishing employment offers.
In 2005, when the study was conducted for the first time, 26 per cent of it was released.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it was 60 per cent gross.
Ingredients of job opportunities, according to the analysis, significantly reflect the current situation on the labour market.
For example, it can be a simple comparison of the number of public investors in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, around 25,900 inserates were published during the same period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of working positions on the Internet is focused on higher education, especially for a more qualified professional group.
On the contrary, the offer of employment in daily printing covers a wide range of professions, including those of the workers, the author of Paulina Słástnová’s analysis.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
The internet is occupied by seniors looking for managers and leading staff, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small companies was only reflected on the Internet.
In today's press, part of these professional professions is much lower, but the great representation is mainly professional and professional.
Of course, among the most frequently mentioned requirements that employees make by means of tenders are education.
In the next area, knowledge of foreign languages, especially English, was the key.
In daily printing, the requirement for learning a foreign language was stated in three percent of the ads, on the Internet by 37 percent.
Only two per cent of employees requested active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Steps to 'computer graffiti' were found in 40 per cent of ads (in daily printing 11 per cent, on the Internet 57 per cent).
Praxe was required in 54 per cent of inserates.
The requirements for practice are always linked to qualified professions.
In particular, it is about leading products and other leading workers.
The industrial professions include, in particular, mechanics, repairers or manufacturers and food processors or electric equipment repairers, which was completed by the study author Jiři Tillner.
Employees shall also include in half of their inserates the requirements for the property and competence of the indicators concerned.
As the most often required skills, communication skills are already long-standing in the first place.
Other employees require flexibility, adaptability and dynamicness, independence, responsibility, organizational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of the New York Festival comedy: New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where a solo comical exhibition was born in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the varied artist Frank Frey, who worked as chairman of the events at the Palace Theatre theatre in Broadway, began to give the audience an introduction to the method of conversation.
Fayova's innovation has grown over the years, the latest through the New York comedy festival.
The festival is based and organized by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Solomon Comedy Carolinas Institute, celebrates its 10th anniversary – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolina and have been successful in this way that they are too big to play in the club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wendy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mahera, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy performance in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
A number of comics from this year's festival have emerged from non-traditional channels such as show in less-voting or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll grew up with his satchel (the piantic "League" on a fantastic-photball theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy Central station show.
Jenny Slate was a member of the "Saturday night live" program, as well as "Parks and recreation", but most of the time she celebrated the wide series of videos "Marcel the shell with Shoes on".
Like Kroll, both Slate, like other young comedys with clearly recognized voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, friendly, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), they are the product of a decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest events of the festival will be the talk: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedy, but he became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and says, "Man, if I get all the money, I might live here."
The price of robbery has fallen at $96 per barrel.
On Friday, the price of opium continued to decline as the high-performance concerns were assessed by a report showing the strengthening of the Chinese electricity industry.
The U.S. fuel indicator for solar supply during the late morning ended up in European electronic commerce at 14 cents per $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday there was a decrease of 39 cents and a decrease of 5.8 per cent remained for the month.
The rich stockings of robbery in the past weeks have made the price difficult.
The Ministry of Energy in the middle announced that the US resources increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, he came up with a larger questionnaire showing growth in practice.
This means that China's economic collapse could continue to increase by 7.8% after growth, which took place after the previous two weak decades in the third quarter.
Ropa Brent, an international rock indicator also used by American refineries, fell at the London International Trade Exchange of 26 cents at $108.58 per barrel.
Well, no, Mr. Haske.
We have a unique opportunity to show politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to develop such pressure so that Martin Hasek is free of all political functions and has left the mission.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture that is already so moving.
Martin Hasek is protected by the promise that he has made, but everyone and politics must in particular be aware of the consequences of that promise and take a great deal of into consideration what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that policy has (Mr. Babish has this weight, but it is a question of policy).
The best program pursued by the liar is unreliable.
It doesn't talk about politics, it's about politics.
Mr. Hašku, if you think this is good with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in it if you didn't, if you didn't, - here you see how fake it is), leave the policy alone as a boy.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
In the wrong case, you will be taken into consideration as innocent minors whose words or actions you cannot believe.
Either you want to be proud to be a missing person or a lifeboat.
You may think it's unfair when I speak only of you, but you're the opposite leader and they're just wrong sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to shut your ears for a while, to shift your powers, to sit down here and then rest up again, but that's how the parties or suspects behave.
You're, I repeat, in your eyes, your boss, the alpha guy, so act like this.
Accept responsibility and leave politics.
The Court has blocked the regulation on the procedure for the arrest and search of persons by the NY police department
On Thursday, the Federal Appeals Court blocked the court regulation requiring amendments to the suspension and inspection programme of persons at the New York police station and dismissed the court from the case.
The second appeal court of the United States said that the decision of Judge Shiry Scheindlin would be postponed until the appeal by the city.
In July, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme of suspension and questioning of people.
Instead of its conclusions and its corrections, the decision to grant monitoring to the police department helped to change its procedures and its school programme.
The Court of Appeal has heard in the preliminary arguments for the requested suspension.
The Court of Appeal said that the Court had to be called on because it had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that as a judge it was not able to avoid the existence of a company, partly because of a series of media and public statements that were open to the Court’s criticism.
It decided that the police officers had violated the civil rights of dozens of people when they were wrong-minded about the blacks and Hispanic in their programme of arresting and searching for persons.
It established independent monitoring to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and monitoring, and ordered the launching of the pilot programme for testing cameras carried on bodies in some areas where they are most likely to be placed.
In July, New York City voted to end the name and address of the people whose cases were rejected after the police investigation.
The oral reason for the city's withdrawal is once planned after 14 March 2014.
A number of civil rights defenders have criticized the tactics of arresting and investigating persons.
In some form, there are about a decade-old people's stopover and search, but in most cases there were black and Hispanic visits to independent age management, which were dramatically increased by 684 330 in 2011.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to the minority, filed a complaint that was a case of group complaints.
The suspensions of the programme of suspension and inspection of persons by the NY police department claim that the changes are ending unfair practices, increase the reliability and effectiveness of the police assembly and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opposers claim that the changes reduce police morale, but not crime, and that they are making money, but they do not solve more problems when the police congregation is under pressure after the last decade has reduced its number of thousands of people.
The Court noted that it did not complete the practice of setting up and searching for a person who is constitutional but reformed the way the visits of the NY police department were conducted.
Five shopping centers are affected by low-visitivity
This is reflected in the data from the real consultancy companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnics, the public will be the 19th Prague shopping center.
There are now about 90 major shopping centers in the PRC.
Unsatisfied performance concerns approximately 20 per cent of large and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large centers on local and bad layout, so too much patter or complicated and unobtrusive landscape arrangement, possibly dead centre," said Michal Sotak from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the leading department of retail properties Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five shopping centers are affected by low-visitivity.
Among the main reasons are poor transport availability, low reception categories of local citizens or market overload in the given place.
Some projects have been opened almost fully, but their results have been most disturbing at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and unwilling to change their shopping habits.
A new shopping centre must work more to 'lakat' its customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing," Samadi added.
The content of shopping centers is generally stable, even in some centres, because the buyers were willing to drop out of the rent and acquire some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully covered and that average content is thus reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouci)," Sotak added.
The shopping centre opened up in the last two years, according to Sylvie Samadi, is very low.
A place on the market for new projects, but there is.
The number of places suitable for building the successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for building a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
On the market, there is certainly room for building smaller local projects, such as 'convention centres', which focus on purchases and services for the daily needs of citizens living in the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotaka, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
And it's both for small 'services' centres, for large projects in Prague, or for medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"The cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, there is a room for a commercial centre prepared at the Victory Hall, and according to it they still have a clear potential of the street on Příkopė and Václavska.
"Intensively, expansion of spare parts of the parks that allow dealers to cover and expand to even smaller cities for affordable rental and operating costs is also in some locations for less local or residential shopping centres, depending on their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of priority shopping houses, which are difficult for good location," DTZ added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of square square metres of rental space.
The fourth of all these shopping centers is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, is derived from Incoma GfK's data.
In the number of shopping parks, the PRC is below the EU average, compared with the values from Britain and France remaining in the Czech Republic about 50 metres per 1,000 inhabitants.
Coulson turned to the phone to check the guy.
The former editor of news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson has carefully used the methods of “turning to phone, tracking and confrontation” to confirm the sub-director of the charity relationship to which the present Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke, was to be involved.
State representative Andrew Edis of the Old Bailey court said that the news of the World had received false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had seen his "attractive special advice" to Hannah Pavlby.
The newspapers believed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to turn to Paulby's voice recorder and penetrated into her private, but the court found that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The State Representative means that Mr Coulson, who is now not a NotW editor, is not a person standing in front of the house and hopes that people will be caught outside, but a person who likes to tell people stories to see what they're saying," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW's newspapers used three ways to test stories: getting to the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, tracking, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Do you know about getting on the phone?
He says no, we say, "But he certainly knows."
The friendly relationship with Clarke was first touched by the news reporter NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Paulby was said: "You just waste time, this is Charles."
The record of the votes taken from her phone on at least three occasions was received at the Mulcairo house in July 2006.
Researchers also found records on the computer of the private investigator where Mrs. Paulby and her sister were designated as "Projects".
During the time that Mrs. Paulby’s research was conducted, her parents received anonymous telephone calls asking for information about Paulby, said Mr. Edis.
Meanwhile, the former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were monitoring Mrs. Paulby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: "I got a story we're going to publish tomorrow and I'd like to talk to Charles very much."
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as that of other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The Court held on Thursday that Coulson was facing Mr. Blunkett because of his kind relationship with his wife, while he himself met with the defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks moved in with other persons for telephone calls from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to turn to the phone.
The deployment of NSAs increases the Community's peer review by state
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police warlord jumped over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Agency for the Protection of Statutes (BfV), the German Home Reporting Agency, the mission was to arrange photographs of the surface of American front-views located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that the BfV Authority hoped it would be able to identify the presence of hearing antennas, and this action had put an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. National Reporting Director, reiterated in September that the United States does not use its foreign reporting opportunities "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in the benefits of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since the time that Edward Snowden, who became an informant from his partner, began to withdraw his valuable collection from the United States of America's secret surveillance, European governments and former businessmen no longer know if they have to believe in the words of the directors.
According to reports, the U.S. National Security Agency conducted a spyage in Brazil’s slave company and obtained access to the data available by American suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, has achieved a general overview of the state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last one came up with the discovery that Angely Merkel's cell phone was probably ten years off.
If it is possible to be the most powerful person in Europe, then there are no doubt potential businessmen.
Snowden has reviewed intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a study published in July by the EC Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial spying and data theft, the USA is now at the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the whole document issued by Mr Snowden, however, that the United States has transmitted the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and indicated that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States:
The former businessmen are skeptical about this.
From the German Parliament the votes are calling for us to make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open it up a little bit...
This is not a road, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany comes from coal for cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
The expansion and technical development of American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is for some companies who have assumed that China is the biggest threat to monitoring, although shocking.
There is a large business in a cloud-based accounting technique where European representatives in general have found that data stored in the United States fall under dark jurisdictions and are therefore potentially offensive.
According to a study carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, approximately 10 per cent of non-American members after the US Prism's data transfer programme has cancelled plans to use a cloud supplier with a seat in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the general executives of the SAP, says: "We have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-ranking actors argue that the latest reports are only confirmations of what they already knew: that powerful states want to suppress their most valuable secrets and that this data must be protected at every price.
It's not surprising that there's an economic spy.
He always did it.
"It has been an important topic for many years and has not changed much during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, director general of the Agrochemical Society of BASF.
The Americans are doing spying on us at trade and industry level, as we are doing spying on them because it is in our national interest to protect our companies.
The subcontractors generally do not want to mix themselves with the countermeasures they have taken to prevent the attackers from benefiting from doing so.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking on a free USB drive or leaving an unguarded notebook in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Car Presentation, says it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the meeting so that they can not be used as a listening device.
The German BfV’s lead staff are advised to consider whether to use mobile phones on foreign routes simply because of the risk that smart phones can be mistrusted.
Prepaid mobile phones will then go out.
However, it is concerned that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading representatives of the global market in their specific areas.
"The small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their business secrets against unauthorised access," warns BfV in its report.
The United States protects its own companies against economic spyage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post National Intelligence Estimate, the National Intelligence Estimate was placed in the French province of Russia and Israel in the second series of lawyers who are engaged in hacking activities for economic reporting, which is now for China.
A member of the Council in the German-risk company concluded that in terms of economic Spain, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French Internal Reporting Agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: "The services are well aware that all countries, even though they are working in the fight against terrorism, are working on spying on their connections."
The parents of an unaccompanied Georgian boy who died in a tragic accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an unaccompanied boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a corrupt spirit in his middle school, believe their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdosta in Georgia was found on 11 January in the same spirit as the courts in the gymnasium where he went.
Sheriffs from the Lowlands County area concluded that Johnson died of an accident, but the 17-year-old's family refuses to do so.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son was murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crupp, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff declared.
"They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, physical laws and also to sound reasoning," Crupp said.
They think it's going to stop what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual they sent their son to school and he came back looking for the dead," he said.
On Thursday, the representative of the State Michael Moore said he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death and noted that several key issues remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore announced at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll be following the facts, let them tell me where I am.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink meant that Johnson died as a result of the "pollution".
However, according to Moore, the second drink introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questions here that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if Johnson's death reveals enough evidence for an order to investigate or violate civil rights, the FBI and its enforcement are required.
The representative of the sheriff's office from the Lowlands area was not immediately available on Thursday for the comment.
The judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
The parents of a young person hope that videotapes will contain a step leading to finding out how their son died.
The CDC Centre issued a directive on children's allergy to schools
In the centre of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a guide file was issued to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first file of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, which is due to the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The CDC found that exposure to food allergy to children increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 per cent.
The guidelines include information for schools on how the teacher’s congregation and staff are aware of the child’s food allergies and how to react, if any, to allergic reactions.
The school also recommends that adrenaline – the most commonly used automatic epiPen sign injection – be able to respond to potentially life-threatening sensitivity.
State law enforcement authorities have recently updated the rules that allow schools to manage adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in discussions with children who have allergic reactions.
The child can say, "It's like someone pushed me into my language," "I feel like I've got a dumb language" or "I know a language".
Parents of intersex children can choose "unseen sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third half of children born with a non-unimportant primary equipment.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned only to male or female sex.
A new law of parents does not require any sex for such children and allows them to be placed on their birth lists as “uncertain” or “unspecific”.
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents so that their child can decide wisely for surgery for sex and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
According to BBC, after many years, one intersexual person said: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll stay with a slatanian created by a doctor, assisted and discovered.
It is estimated that every year from 2000 children are born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of general development disorders, triggering terms for those who have atypical chromosomes, general glands (weaves or varletes) or unusual genetics.
The intersexual could be Wallis Simpson.
Sexting is not fully understood yet, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to identify it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of a child until the operation is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in sex-specific problems, said that the new German law "does look like a good thing".
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children are not," he said.
Six-six can be performed without surgery and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how the child develops the primary responsibility is not too precise.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a coincidence why some people are homosexuals.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not binding on sex but on their biological structure which is neither exclusively male nor female but typically is compatible with both and cannot be clearly defined as none of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary primary characteristics such as fame, hair growth, hairdressing and positioning, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and general tools, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by people living in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't correspond to any sex now have a special team.
Australia and Nepal are already able to mark in official documents male, female or "third-sixth-six".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the first "unlawful" person worldwide in June when she won a court call to be able to leave the status of "unclean" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry, there will be German passports except M (men) and F (women) and third markings, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the French report, 24 problems still remain controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strong Catholic country signed petitions for the removal of “sex theory”.
The American Catholic website online also limited itself to the German law and wrote: "With the world being drawn to a new state when half of it is a question of choice, but the sexual activity of no one, we are turning over two other pillars of civilization."
One mother who was born from Maryland also said to Baby in the area that she would rather see her child share sex at birth.
“ Parenthood alone is stressful and without other restrictions, especially if you do not know half of your child,” she said to the website concerning parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermafrosts, according to the view of the Greek who had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a tablet that could be cut and re-emerged.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of surgery, with the fact that gender is complex and doctors may sometimes make the wrong decision, because they don't know how children will feel as they grow up because of their sex.
"In the mid - 20th century, psychiatric preparedness was called," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Continual theory of dealing with children with an unusual gender was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of "principal liability" and argued that social causes and impacts – how parents raised their children – influenced the genes and hormones of the child and created a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case since 1966, known as "John/John", his theory has become controversial.
To the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a mishandled weapon, he recommended that they let their child be completely destroyed, removed his belt and treated her like a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he stopped operating on the boy again and married his wife.
In 38 years, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming, survivors of these operations appeared to be "inconsistencies with results".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montany who was born with male chromosomes but was not unique in nature.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live as a man in a "peaceable life".
And so soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from his external organs and guarded and was treated as a girl.
In 12 years, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18th he was sent to the front desk.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized after I was born and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with poor sex development (DSD), which prevented his body from producing enough amounts of testosterone in order to develop his basic tools correctly.
After learning the truth, he changed his mind to his husband, took his testosterone doses and let himself be removed from his pockets,
The operation has caused his infertility.
Today it represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the attention of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the head of the legal group Advocates for informed choice with residence in California, is afraid that the German law "is calling for healing and access".
“Many activists are afraid that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and to choose for a child ‘injury’," she said.
We're afraid it'll cost us intervention.
We think it's better to assign them to male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law finally comes up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be enrolled in the third half".
"A mature person should be able to make his own decision on a legal basis," she said.
The German law tends to assign her at birth.
It's a fight the little child wouldn't know at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a lack of social development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "works power" both for parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called an intolerance syndrome on Androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are toxic, they've developed into Katie's female rice.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have any work and no homework.
Now, 29 years old, Katie is married and works as a nurse at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is infertile, it is hoped that it will become a parent through adoption or replacement.
"The law gives parents a certain space so they don't rush to their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think about it and give them time before they write "a man" or "a woman".
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you're glad to have it.
You don't have to run an operation that's non-returnable.
"This gives the child the opportunity to make decisions and take away the responsibility of the parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex I get more upset with – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the right to make their own decisions.
The driver burned the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The pressure increased, the fear grew.
The man started threatening to burn down the whole house.
Instead, all available police officers in the environment, as well as the youth coaches from Boleslav and the volunteer trainee team.
The police officer who tried to explain his irrational behavior also arrived at the scene.
The man further threatened to burn down the house.
She had to come home with a crew member who was injured and injured.
Then, the aggressionr ended up in a juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic hospital.
At last, the Hasichis slept in the house of police gasoline with the sorbent that later calmed down.
Furthermore, all domestic animals were preserved except for persons.
The man didn't give up on the police prosecutor. That's what the command came after him.
Report: The Obama campaign was planning to exchange Bidena for Hillary Clinton
The most close adviser to President Baracka Obama, according to the New York Times' list, was secretly considering the award of a 2012 candidate by Vice-President Joe Bidena for Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most significant sensory book ever expected from Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna "Dubble down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming book and announced Thursday evening that the presidents had held an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011 to find out whether Biden's release would help revive Obama's burning hopes of re-election.
According to the National Political Journal of Times, Jonathan Martina, the book offers a basic record of the efforts of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head office of Bill Daley's White House, to determine what effect the elections would have on the movement of former foreign ministers from Clinton's post to Vice-Presidents.
The potential change was precisely covered by the secrecy of the Chichagic infrastructure of the campaign and within Oval's work.
Only a few of the most closeest advisers, including Daley, former chief of Obama's campaign, Jim Messiny, and former chief consultants in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew that this change was being considered.
The book Double Down states that Daley was a representative of the effort to reward Bidena, despite their close personal relationship, and that until the time finally they decided not to do so when the data showed that Clinton's accession to the candidate would “not significantly increase the chance of both”.
In his conversation with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered the revenge of Biden Clinton.
"I have intensively examined a number of things and this was one of them," said Daley's letter.
You should not forget that at the time, the president had a bad opinion, so we said, "Christmas, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the research as "required care", Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a small investment to find out whether this was going to be paid in the elections.
"In campaigns, such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research if something is not really affected," Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about this potential carate arrest.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president was "wise", the former lead officer admitted that Obama was "probably" aware of it.
Martin added that the book Double Down definitely does not answer the question whether the political probe got to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on the release of Bidena from the candidate.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British company produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – for use in the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a shining memory.
He came up with an idea when he read the expert agreement on the media and convinced scientists in China that they were chemically producing protein that causes light.
This cold reacts to the language of the consumer – increases the pH in the protein and then results in inflammation.
Chris says the cold of the light when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, and so the more you lie, the clearer it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (Oil me, I taste great), says, "It's a great substance, but if it's about production, we're going to start, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for 200 GBP."
The protein we use in the freezing process reacts to your language with neutral pH.
So as your mouth burns protein, the pH levels increase and the cold begins to grow.
We've been testing her for the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween's celebration because it's causing this fantastic side effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because lighting media is four times more expensive than gold.
And that's how every doll is worth about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company living in Bristol is known for its non-traditional presence of beer, cheese, eggs and golden leaves.
His next product should be more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
It's basically impossible because of the part of the light of the ice crystal that I'm creating, but I'm counting on some way to do it.
The freezer uses the fluorescent properties of the medules, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
We were able to eat sweetness with our sister, stay up a long distance, and take the neighbors to the opposite side.
I feel like I'm getting worried today.
After two years there has been no sugar in my home, and this year is probably nothing else.
However, statistics show that I am, in the case of Halloween, a black sheep.
According to the National Small Business Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will be celebrated by most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend up to $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and clothing.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, it's trendy.
According to the NRF, it is expected that from 6.9 billion dollars spent on costumes, 1.2 billion will be spent.
This year are the last explosion of sexual non-life objects.
Sexy must no longer be just women; sexes can also be eaten like pizza, hamburger and hamburger.
As far as man is concerned, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies through the dead, and I'll bet that the space men from Daft Punk this year will get into our channels in Instagram.
According to Google companies, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and wizards.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we wore our dogs in costumes and we weren't the only ones to my surprise.
In fact, according to the U.S. NRF this year, $330 million is spent on animal pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of play dogs.
If it's about sweetness, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen US$ 1.9 billion.
It's a 300 million kilogram of Hershey table, lisate, milk duds and Twizzlers and Uncle Clark.
This is an amazing report for 41 million employees who, according to the U.S. Ministry of Commerce, are trying to cross our square.
In fact, we're buying Halloween, and you don't believe us, and we're consuming 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want are chicken bombs, but according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween, it sells about 16,000 tons.
It's about 9 billion individual chicken bombs.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing's more typical for Halloween than terrible homes.
They have the best names such as "Terror behind the walls" and "The House of shock".
In fact, in the United States there are officially dedicated 1200 horrendous houses, which according to the U.S. terrorist home, are worth 500 million dollars, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are scared and giving your friend a Facebook page, and you can't remove them and this person who likes you will look at the photo and write a comment like "you're being pretty."
And at last, there's something about the days.
When we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us a big day (Great Pumpkin) and cutting off the debt lucerna is something like getting a Christmas tree – we're doing it from the baby.
Luckily for us the "children in the day" trend began with the application Pinterest first loni, so most of us grew up on the fact that we were cutting up instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. census Office, the United States spends about $106 million on debt.
The gold lucerna with myotate flame on your front porch is probably coming from Illinois, where this year has grown 245 thousand tons of gold.
If you want something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathhisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut their days of weighing almost one ton.
Notice of the series of Rover Lands
The interior has a racing seat and six-way safety belts as well as an inter-communicator device.
The selection is perfect noises, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle coordination between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants in the race who come to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced athletes, but they are people who want to awaken and well-being as well as a viable path to world-class sports.
We are pleased that we can offer them this path in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this form offers a new way to apply various competition disciplines in Britain and will conclude that it is preparing competitors for the strength and reality of Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of Defender Challenge train – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge offers school and test day and also the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: For two years we have an early election here
President TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another preliminary vote.
A week after the last week in the discussion for Current.cz he said that there is no other exit and every government comes out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible secret.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, counting the life span of the beginning of the electoral period for two years.
Noting that the next voters will choose otherwise entirely, they do not agree: "I think this will be a bit more balanced decision."
At the same time, President TOP 09 does not allow his party to lose its vote in other elections as a year (by 2010 there were 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was within two months that early elections would be made clear, it would be forced by UN 2011 by Andreje Babish.
In the wrong case, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
A turbulent situation in the ČSSD where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after the Polish meeting of the party's party's alleged leadership, announced that he or Michal Hashek, commented Schwarzenberg after:
"Leaders of the Democratic Party as small boys go to the capital of the state to allow them to turn away."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I have not seen anything so suddenly stupid in my life," added President TOP 09.
And in the direction of the President of the Earth (which he fought in the fight against the presidential function), he said: "The role of the Head of State is clear: He wants to strengthen this party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the greatest surprise of your personal choice?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first legislative proposals in snow, including the Farsi Register of Treaties concluded before the elections by snow committee, but earlier elections have fallen under the table.
President TOP 09 in his discussion on Current.cz says that such speed is given by "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 wants to clearly anticipate similar attempts on the other side.
For example, UNO volunteer leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 of pre-emptive fighting that the idea of registering the contract "purchasing" program of UNO.
TOP 09 now used a jump - she simply rejected the proposal which had already been assigned to a second reading.
The Hasian units have come to save lost buildings that were 15 meters above the ground at a dangerous train station in the mine
The bastard Ruby ran after a little car accident.
Three days later, the man who was caught in the cane saw the dog.
The Hasichis flew down the stairs to save the dog from certain deaths.
The building was set free by fire units who agreed to release it after having somehow landed on a dangerous trainer in a 15 - foot [15 m] basement above the ground.
The nine-month-old coward Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone until he was released from the basement.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his friend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit Stonehouse in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran into a small accident, he was burned to death after his lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
In the middle of about 14.15, the burstosman of the sighted Ruby was looking at a trainer in a 15 - foot [15 m] stone loft above the ground.
Instead, the technical rescue team from Cleckheaton's fire station and jumped down to free Ruby, which he used to release after a scale of transport bag for animals.
Andy Clayton, a professional leader of the technical rescue team, said: Pes was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the stairs – 15 meters from top and bottom.
When he was saved, he was completely frozen.
But now it's okay.
He's got the cuts.
It was a very unusual departure.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
A professional leader of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said: "The robbers were very lucky during their escape."
There was a chance that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and in addition to excavating and dehydration, he was fine.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was scared about the rescue action."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in hand again.
The veterinarian said if he had been too tired and exhausted, he would probably have fallen.
The Hasids did a great job.
What they did was very embarrassing.
We're very grateful to them. They were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The Hasids were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says after that 18-year-old Katy Perry didn't make it.
During an interview for the Australian voting order this week, the eight-star star said that for Jaggerov the song "Old Habits die hard" in 2004 was sung by an authentic vocalist.
Perry said when she was 18, she had this annual vet dinner and he went after her.
And she added, "It's been a long time and now it's very nice to me."
In a statement by Jagger's fourth representative (70), the representative said that he categorically refused that when he would make a proposal by Katy Perry.
The representative said, "Maybe you'll have him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guests (a singer) who appeared at the Rolling Stones concert this year.
Her new album "Prism" started this week at the first place.
George Kerevan: divided Europe gives Scots to the election
The next day, another terrible story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be his entry into Schengen.
This led to stories of passive controls in Berwick and the rest of Hadrian Valley.
It is true that Strathclyde has mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but it has not been mentioned to the headlines as expected.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend much time adapting their official laws if they do so.
In view of the fact that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continuing non-compliance would be a cheap payment for Brussels for anything they really want from Scotland.
So it's a pretty bad story.
And so old that it became a funeral, a newspaper corner, that "independence means passive control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, in this kind of talk, there is one interesting idea.
Why should it even be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why change the London shirt for that Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: a large holiday plan to bring Europe together has finally been wasted.
The impact of the euro crisis is called the European Project officially dead.
In addition, Europe is affected by the parties committed to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – based this year – has come to an end and has already used nearly five million votes in the various federal elections, which in Bundestag under the "exit" of the Free Democracy (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
At home, there was always opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resilience of Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the national economy, through the joint exchange, has led many to the view that Europe's project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has only a small share of the fact that the national governments of the economy with a high budget deficit – it was only in the case of Greece.
It is more about the euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates that are useful for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
In the area of domestic production, South Europe has no access to domestic currency.
The only aid is short-term revenue and public expenditure – which Germany spends.
The current problems with the budget and the exchange are a deeper cause of European retail performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code for supporting French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for petrol as it is in the United States.
This is a paralysing non-expenditure in the area of costs, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not all the freezing of payments in the world would prevent the European petrochemical industry from becoming a cheap coal mine in the United States.
As a result, there is a growing pressure, especially in France, when the EU stands above.
After the political elite war in France, the EU saw the EU as a tool that Germany will hold on to and enable Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, has no need for Paris as a demonstration of political legitimacy and has left its own economic policy in Europe and the French economy in need of it.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Pene, the anti-European National Front, just won major additional elections and withdrew the ruling socialists to a third place.
The front is now with 24% of the most popular voice in France – a temporary warning for British workers that they can't assume that the right-wing is automatically shown on the left.
How does Le Pene manage his new live popularity among the white working class?
European elections next year would like to use the European Parliament to create an anti-European anti-communal blockade.
If the anti-European parties behave well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can be dominated first in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe in this that the growing anti-European feelings and anti-communal conditions are linked and the euro is lost.
The EU does not disappear, but changes are more freer in the meaning of "Europe (substantial) peoples," has already been prioritised by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own changes.
I hope that the United Kingdom will distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, the increased interest in Washington about Tichomore indicates that Britain will be left with Atlantic cold.
And where's Scotland?
We can choose to be the area (mainly) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this also includes the opportunity to inform Berlin and Brussels when they are going to let us be.
I assume that Scotland would lead well into the free movement of Europe in the assumption that it would keep its own change.
Cooperation with other countries like this would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
In the wrong case, we should take Norway as an example and leave our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – in turn – the most successful political drive in Europe, which has won a large majority in 2011, thanks to its opposition towards the skeletons planned (and implemented) by the laboratory Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now wished independence only to adopt the contested measures adopted by Berlin and Brussels.
Honorable Piperta: Successful in the Past
A study showed that Afro-Americans and Spaniards reach puberty before their white breeds.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
No evidence has been found that hormones or other chemicals are present.
Experts claim that one of the former pubertys can be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of previous puberty isn't so sharp for boys.
Former CNN Pat Etheridge report is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughter begins breast-feeding and breast-feeding at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Doctors of Children in Florida this week, Pediatric Endocrinologist Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time with my parents ensuring that this is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, breast-feeding and in support of the body’s peace, appear early in the girl’s life.
In the last four decades, however, it has been only a small move at age when it comes to the first menstrual cycle.
In the United States, the average age of 12.5 years is 12.75 years in 1970.
“When I start developing breasts, they will take at least two to three years before it comes to the first menstrual period,” said Kaplowitz, who is also author of the book “Early pubertys in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
The most reliable test of how to continue puberty is time.
It is discussed what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if breast growth is achieved by a growing demand before the age of 8, a girl is considered to be "foreignly experienced".
In most cases the process is slowed or stopped – which doctors can closely monitor.
Faster growth can be a reason for endocrinologists to carry out tests for the purpose of eliminating serious problems such as nausea or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay time periods and prevent other consequences: early aging of the bone which may eventually lead to stop growth and confusion in adulthood.
The recommendations for medicines and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, the speed of development, the speed of growth and emotional growth.
The psychological aspects are also important.
When it comes to taking medications, Kaplowitz is careful, but he admits that "puberting can solve problems with girls' behavior and their feelings that they are different from their breeders".
Understandably, there is another major problem: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstrual periods.
"They are worried that it can get pregnant or how it will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started having a menstrual period of 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruating together, she wasn't prepared emotionally.
She came from school scared and angry that she's one of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no evidence that they are on the wine of hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty early.
Caplowitz is predicting that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study in girls aged 6 to 9, which connects body fat with puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, Africans and Spanish have the ability to reach puberty before their white challenges.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, it appears that models of time-consuming puberty are affected by all economic conditions across the atmosphere and by genes.
Next challenge: Although boys are already under age, the trend towards full-fledged puberty is not as visible as it is to a girl.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Children's Doctors (AAP) added another difficulty.
Acne and abstinence are common even for coyennes and bats.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real phenomenon of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from Goryeb’s Morristown hospital in New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get their child’s doctor’s advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean talking to a child before you can imagine," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop before need to make sure that even though this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Hope of Konvalink in the role of the family.
Does he have a new job?
The Greek Nadja Konvalinkova (62) appeared to be a step in the role of the family and was very successful.
That a favorite Czech heretic would plan a change of profession and become a business in the world?
Hope Konvalink appeared in James Joyce Irish pub and ran a beer there.
I did it first in my life, and I did it right away.
Even the boss offered me a job and I could live with the beer.
But I refused, rather I would stay at what I do today, at inheritance," she said with a smile Konvalink, who was host to the 20th anniversary of the operation of the Irish household.
"I like Irish beer and I'll give it to Irish whiskey," produced my taste here.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague of Paul Newy, also appeared.
I'm dead and I can't get baptized in my new life.
I've been allowed one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep it," added the heretic.
Aircraft manufacturers are looking for a wide range of seats, there are big orders in the bag
Among the leading aircraft producers, there was a dispute about the width of seating in the second class in the long distance, which led to a sharp exchange of views on the air show in Dubai this month.
The subject of the dispute is the wide range of seats given during the long years for the economic class – not the same as that which would normally have preceded airlines, but its assigned area is the key to the success of the latest flights offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm of a wide range of seats in an economic class, but the main American Boeing River says that it is up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturer is competing for the sale of the largest version of its two-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the last part of the aircraft is distributed – especially if 9 or 10 seats are adjacent to it – is the basis of the economic performance fines on the proposals of the new aircraft ‘mini-jumbo’.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm scattered by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model transports 350 people in 46 cm of broad economic seats distributed after 9.
A number of airlines often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be transferred with more than 100 orders, calls directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what can be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financiers a picture of three people sealed in the restaurant with the title “Don’t you like it?”
"Boeing is promoting long-term flights in higher than in regional turbo-survival aircraft," Airbus John Leahy, a leading salesman, said.
As the educational skills change, people are larger, but the seats in planes have not changed radically.
From the beginning of 70 years, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, the average American weight increased by 10 per cent by 40 to 49 years, according to the United States Ministry of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century is 100 cm.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of a 50th-year seat when the average width of the new baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus argues that it carried out a research that indicates that the expansion of seats by 2.5 cm improved sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus's headquarters and says that it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that the research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more than just on the width of the seat.
"It is really about providing airport flexibility and enabling them to carry out things they are convinced that they must do so to be successful," said the expert at the office site Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what they get.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers there is a major area for pickets, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect the results.
To this end, the competition in the orders of aircraft with estimated trade in the next decade is at least $700 billion in catalogue prices in order to avoid the language of American and European exports.
As the agency Reuters pointed out in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what leads to the battle between the latest aircraft.
Like Airbus, Boeing claims that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency than the leading market representative in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The Boingu performance benefits depend on the parts to compare the design of model 777X with 10 seats in series and 777 with 9 seats in row.
The profit in unit costs is reduced by reversing the 10th century concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to speed up more seats and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, leader of the Airbus company for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in order for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a higher distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"The forty-five-centimetre wide seat would be great for the passenger, but the reality is that from the business perspective of Airbus, the proposal is motivated by the threat model 777," said an expert at the inside office of Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network Portal.
Airbus and Boeing don't add seats, but they offer the air carrier's supplier's directory so they can choose.
The air traffic controllers even carry measuring brakes to check the competitive arrangements.
While I agree, all manufacturers also offer high-speed air carriers for low-cost companies and regional passengers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in order, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Recently Airbus highlighted the need for greater office repair by offering some of his planes a wider seat in the streets.
Experts say that without the support of another manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can be done from the sale of 777X.
The number of HIV infected has exceeded the thousands in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of orders increases each year.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed infections in 50 people, 121 years later, and 180 in 2010.
Loni was assigned 212 and was a record number.
"The total number of new diagnosed cases this year is over 200, which I believe is no doubt," observed an expert on the problem of AIDS Miroslav Hlavý, who brought the Prussian Light House to patients in the summer.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September, 176 during the same period.
From the start of the study to the end of the annual trial, HIV was confirmed by 1710 men and 353 women, most of whom were infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Middle East, 206 were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the country of Yehomorav, 130 from Moravian or 116 from Usteck.
At least the ordered came from the Highness, there were 19 of them.
Almost 88% of patients were sexually infected.
Forty people in the past suffered from blood transfusions.
However, such a case has not appeared in the PRC since the beginning of the testing, so over the fourth century.
He also had six children born with HIV, transferred to them from his mother.
The funny things in Gravitance are, but it's seen as beautiful, says experts.
Fantastic film from Gravitatione universe was produced in Czech cinema for some time after the prime minister.
In time, he was seen by the Union film distributors of nearly 150 thousand fans and made over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews evaluate the picture positively.
Others, however, find certain differences.
Lidovsky.cz server asked a number of experts from astronomers and astrophysics how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of Star and Planetary Brno): I like science- Fantastic films that I consider to be modern, dreaming.
The film Gravitation is not surprising, even though it appears as a "physically real" presentation.
No, but it doesn't mean he'll be bad.
I enjoyed him so much.
You may need Sandra Bullock's hair that doesn't seem to be in trouble.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving on very different common roads, so they cannot be seen at one stop.
Some movie fans read unrealistic effects and even the whole conduct of fire in the state of ease.
Skafandri would not suffer such wounds, they say.
In Gravitational film Hrodins often get into a wheelchair with different objects and clothes without any greater difficulty.
The criticism has not been saved, nor has the action package been saved.
So widespread tragedy on the common road Earth is, according to some debateers, unrealistic.
Moreover, she wondered why the doctor had been sent to the universe to correct the technique.
People in the woods also care about "unreal" behavior.
This is the same way as it would be for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary, etc.): I've seen him only on a broad pay, but I can only say that I was upset.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a case, the author has the right (so far as duty) not to adhere consistently to the reality.
"More than you mentioned inconsistencies, I was touched by how three times the shown space station with degraded level techniques (lastly Chinese) has been shown."
"China's gonna be over by the end of the decade and it'll probably look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomy Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the author is very successful in not violating physical laws, and so naturally guided by a vision of assessment that at various cosmic collisions and conflicts, the moment of mobility is quite right, said by a dictionary of physics, as well as the view of Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin openings of the atmosphere and polar zones that are emerging in polar areas.
The differences are likely to occur during the more detailed examination.
I have also found, for example, when reading comments, that the preferred direction for the duration of a different spacecraft on a common road is to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štépán (Employer of the Astronomy Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and into the heavens, I have not recorded in the film a violation of logic or natural laws, and compared to other similar films, it is seen that the authors have given their attention to the probability of the events.
From time to time, it is worth noting the fact that Hubbl's space telescope runs across an orbit other than the ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference between the speed of each other and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the division of Kowalsky (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not realize that the entire ISS would be rounding, so there is no clear reason for the forces that are affecting Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at a time when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New anti-nicotin vaccines may remove the pleasure from smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine that can take away the pleasure from smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of vaccine has proved to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for the rest of its life.
Before testing people, further tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Well Cornell's medical college in New York says the first signs are good.
“We are confident that this type of vaccination strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and overcome all methods available on the market today, but have found their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches have been overcome,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been developed to store genetic information for the development of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then begin to create a fluid flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies follow all of the molecules of nicotine in the blood vessel and neutralize them before they get into the brain that prevents them from getting nicotine.
In vaccinated mice, which were additionally added to nicotine, continued in their normal activities.
But the mice that were not vaccinated “have calmed down”, said researchers, which means that nicotine has reached their brains.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previously on tobacco vaccines have been sold because they contain antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often in order to maintain enough cold resistance, so they were shown to be expensive and not practical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they change liver cells to factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people were to be completely safe, they could be given to children before they would have to taste cigarettes and it would be so dependent on nicotine.
However, it would be much more likely that the cooks would use it to stop.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not have any profits because of nicotine vaccines, and this will help them get rid of this crime,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they cautioned that further research was needed.
Tripodi says he's going to influence Obeid.
An ex-Labourist Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for Corruption Control.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripod said he would change the coastal rent policy at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeida, who had hidden interests in three estates on the controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its opinion on Friday whether Mr. Obeid had been hunting several state ministers to hire him at the Circuit Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and cafes, without having to participate in the election in July 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeida's keen interest in these properties, based on the evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former representative, Lynne Ashpole.
During the 2005 talks, the government insisted that we go to public competition.
The tenants were against it, and they also wanted longer terms of contract.
In 2009, rentals for firms in the Circuit Quay, which were awarded to the Ombudsman annually, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the Interior from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a public prosecutor.
But he insisted that the changes were made at Mr. Obeida's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged him to join the government's rental policy.
The list of conversations presented in IAC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Mr. Steve Dunn, the lead officer who came to the district hall after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
"Was it the subject of discussions during these telephone calls for the development of commercial procurement policy?" said Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about it.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israel's military aircraft were trapped for the purpose of Syria, said the responsible author
Israeli military aircraft attacked on Thursday night at the target in the Syrian port of Lachish, confirmed the responsible manager of Fox News station.
This responsible manufacturer did not specifically say what purpose was involved, but he said he was at least one.
The Press Agency Associated Press says the target was the SA-125 rockets of Russian production.
At least twice a year ago, Israel carried out an air raid on the supply of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things have gone wrong, and it's different.
Perhaps the commenter Pečinka spoke in such a way that he agreed with what the President of Štès had to say.
Heitman Chovanec was suspicious of me right away when he was elected to the presidency, and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and he is a symbol of the ČSSD beings.
The other gentlemen had their weaknesses in mind.
Senator Dienstbier is fundamentally and read-only and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek was unable to speak on television as much as possible.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than that ČSSD proposed as Vice-President of the President of the Senate, this one should not have an initial handip and I think it would have a standard effect.
It's such a good solution that there's no one to support him.
I'm adding that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the side.
Alena Gaydóškova could without fear set up a minority government with only the blessing of President Babish and without the peoples, but with the human health minister of Hovorka, who is actually a faithful social democracy.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would apply the correct referendum law and would therefore be committed to supporting the President of the University of Okamura.
President Babish would finally calm down the progress of the tax, because he's smart and he's gonna see that it's not going without her.
People wouldn't have problems because Hovorka is the one who's carrying the best thing they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
It also pays for the UN, even here it would be a valuable minister, but if they do not reasonably want to join the risk-free government but provide support, it is also good.
Let's get Alan Gjdóšk!
Foreign workers with visual rights may undergo a “right” test
As the government intends to expand the police steps, the "rights" test for foreign workers with visa rights 457 is considered.
The test, if accepted, will be used by means of criteria aimed at preventing programme 457 from being used to fill out unqualified positions or as a back door for the move of family and friend to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, the former labist delegation, Maxine McKev, condemned the government rhetoric on foreign workers' words that it could offend Australian neighbours.
"The declared 'citizens at the end of the front' and 'working first for Australia' are very unhappy as long as unions require a protected labour market," said the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the White Work Force should be protected – and I wouldn’t wonder if anyone in this region had noticed the name of this historic artifact.
The discussion article sets out 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Transport Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at Siri Lance, where one with the authorities for human trafficking implemented five of the proposed changes and the others remain under consideration.
Where the ‘rights’ criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the designation is entitled to a situation where the applicant is in relation to or personal contact with the owner or relevant person of the sponsor.’
After previous experiences with companies that have attempted to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, the number of visa holders may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
In the mid-35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was on asylum, he died suspected of heart failure after arriving on the steel ship this week on the Easter Island.
His nine - year - old son was traveling to Australia with him, and after his father’s death, he was greeted by a mature brother who was also on board.
The Australian authorities rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
The British government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin when the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport of Baroque Kramer said that the project "joins Britain together".
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "extended" in cooperation with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the end of the phase, two will take the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June the government assessed the estimated cost of building high-speed lines between London and northern England from $32.7 billion to $42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the National Transport Office Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2 to the company in order to find out further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of any travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better offer Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the advantage it brings is enormous.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also about joining – above all, Great Britain will be better united by HS2 with 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr Carmichael called for "singlely" support for the Scottish entry into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed road has the potential to bring the economic benefits to Scotland, but it also gives the economic weight of Scotland in general the high-speed rail system over Britain."
We are therefore working with the British government to examine the possibility of bringing the high speed rail to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is planning as it plans.
I am pleased to review the report on this study with the British ministers during the next year and to make a joint decision on further steps.
With Barto, I arrested the inspection and analytics of the anti-corruption police
The information about the arrest of Vita Barty began to spread on Thursday evening when the first news server brought the message.cz.
The MF DNA found out that the case had been taken into consideration by the General Security Inspection of the Security Councils (GIBS), its people had to arrest Barta in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons hotel.
The inspection shall address cases where the accused police officers are involved, however, its rights also apply to civilian persons.
According to MF DNES, one of the officials of the anti-corruption police is Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Speaking against the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the fact that the media must turn directly to GIBS in this matter.
Her speech inspector, Radka Sandor, did not want anything to say but referred to the City State representation in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of the hidden facts," said the spokesman for Štépánk Zenklová.
This indirect reaction may also lead to the fact that the event has taken place, but it is in a way that the speaker does not allow to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrich Chudoba.
The media said that Barta represents "and in this matter", but because it's about classified information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or returned.
Some media have recently speculated that Bart's arrest could be related to some police president Petre Lessy.
They applied for this right to Barta, together with former President VV, Radek John, who was sitting in front of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute that arose as a result of this had to be resolved between ex-experiment Petrem Necessary and VV even had to be resolved by President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship took place on my person.
No one contacted me. I wasn't heard.
"I really don't know anything about it," IDNES.cz Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially defeated by Council of John, the real leader of the party, but he was Barta right then.
The barta was now running into the election for the St. Louis, the messenger's mission was only strictly unanimity - with 175 votes.
The leader of the Universe, Tomio Okamura, said he doesn't even know what's going on.
"Viet Barta was one of many candidates on our candidate and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the World Direct Democracy Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who said before the elections that he gave Bart room to apply for Education because he helped him solve the problem of executives.
Vít Bárta was tried in 2012 by his former associate of VV Jaroslav Skark.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in Australia for the past time
Traveling Australian airlines will have to continue to remove their tablets and smart phones during the start and arrival and regardless of changes in the United States in order to settle the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Air Administration (FAA) has provided US companies with space to change their procedures, so travellers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if they remain in "aircraft" mode.
Travelers may already do this during a major part of the year, but many people fear that they will not have access to their e-books during startup and accession.
Australian carriers shall examine this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet these requirements, but have indicated that they do not have to change their procedures in the short term.
The Authority for Civil Aviation Safety (CASA) also said that this notification had been examined but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘Casa currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices at the airport’ he said.
This question is covered by provisions which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the entire period and that passengers comply with the safety instructions received from members of the crew.
The company Virginia, which has already talked to CASA about expanding its free entertainment system wi-fi, has been invited to change but has announced that the decision of the regulatory authority is detailed.
"We would like to welcome the analysis by the CASA authority of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have this (free fun), has improved customer experience," he said.
The company Qantas announced that it will be subject to current rules in the past.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment should not be used during flight and landing, and we do not intend to change it quickly," he said.
The FAO rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in the development of a regulatory area that can be useful to our travellers, and we are, of course, studying the FAO decisions and the reasons for them.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the company's interest in the rules will disappear and depend on their old airport.
Transporters will have to point out that their aircraft can tolerate radio transmissions of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, school materials, software and travel information.
“As long as the airline confirms its fleet tolerances, it may allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readings and smart phones at any sea level,” FAO stated.
In rare cases, low visibility of the crew shall order passengers to exit during the arrival of the device.
The group also recommended that a more difficult device be safely placed under seating or in a seating area over the head during the flight.
With growing beads, middle classes are enjoying a stopover in Singapore
In the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stands for the gold ring, ring and ring so she can pay her daughters to school.
"We just bought our husband's house and I gave it all my money," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as an administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family income is insufficient, she says.
The demand for areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increased – is the result of the fact that ValueMax, where a woman is carrying out her business, this week became the third stop on the bridge in Singapore.
The suspension of the syringes is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore residents usually apply the annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, more than 15,4 per cent of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, the local bank with its side in the same shopping center.
However, they benefit from not requiring verification of persons (payment history) or proof of income and can provide loans faster than banks.
And that is why, as families feel pressure from rising living costs and growing household debt and consumer debt, millions of people are on the move towards a stable region.
After five years of possible growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a liberal monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium income are forced to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week's rating agency Standard & Poor's cited increasing domestic credit use, in particular because of increasing rentals as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are taking into account the gross domestic product of the highest household debt in Asia.
Malaysia is head of a hybrid with 80 per cent GDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
The economics were also afraid of high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week only resulted from technical recession.
In the fourth quarter, it showed the continuing poor exports and the weakening of consumer demand.
"It is important that people with rising costs will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the CIMB Bank in Malaysia.
The historical high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to people’s ability to stop their personal property and to take advantage of the opportunity to change the quality of their family shoes.
About 70 percent of the deposits stopped in 200 city buildings are made of gold.
People say, the gold price looks good, we'll stop the grandmother's gold shop and get her back in the next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, reported a 20% increase in the number of customers using its suspension in recent months.
The growth in the maintenance sector is so great that ValueMax, the operator of the districts in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four sides – but also to Asia, says the Executive Director of ValueMax Yeah Lee Chingo.
The company will finance this by 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that received this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discontinuing creditors felt under pressure to criticize high rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the principle does not only offer lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Clients stop items that are already owning and the maintenance of personal property does not increase household debt," he says.
In the company, the principle of property is increasingly adopted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use their savings, they are not just people in financial pressure.
The rich people of Singapore also use the ValueMax areas when they stop the gold bars or Rolex watches and can thus reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are all possible measurements.
"They belong to rich individuals who need to borrow short-term loans for their profitable businesses or investments or small enterprises who need help with solving problems in their financial context," says Ms. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as soon as possible.
Save package of $325 million for Tásman health
The federal government insists that a savings package of $325 million for infectious health in Tasmania contains strict conditions that ensure that the government does not support financial resources.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Federation is making "an urgent measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, by a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The financing for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasman Ambassador Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve specific problems facing the state," said Mrs. Plibersek today.
The $325 million package contains $33 million for patient request surgery.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopedic operations and seating operations, will help to eliminate liability.
Money is also available for free clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better postoperative care, health care training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic records in local hospitals.
"This investment responds to the thoughts that my former clinical doctors have told me that the best way to help the Tasmanian health system," Mrs. Plibersek said.
The Ministry stressed that the Tasmanian government must require strict competition and record obligations.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain the money of the Australian Federation and to inform each month about where additional financial resources have been invested.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be in no way "unless a real reform would be followed in order to lay the basis for a more sustainable public health system".
However, he commended the government for responding to its urgent request for assistance, which was first brought up during the meeting with the President of the Government at the beginning of the July.
"I believe that a federal aid package can free public health from critical conditions," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state governments, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse the recent schedules.
Speaking of the federal opposition in the field of health, Peter Dutton believes that today's declaration is only a "dangerous".
"For the reason I'm here is that the lab government has withdrawn $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a state government worth nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian currency worth $300 million, and pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the spare package will be issued for higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted to the new Denise Diderot, which brings exceptional film production and creation of time, but it is also more boring than it should be.
They leave in France in the 60th century and tell a full story about Suzanne, a young sleek who is sent to a monastery by her family.

The film never depends on greed or sensitivity, and that's his problem.
The official record of this story leads to the fact that even the wildlings will experience a similar wearing of a yellow shirt.

Syria has destroyed its means of producing chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with light gas, said the Fourth Committee on Global Monitoring on Chemical Weapons, while there have been rapid conflicts in the north of the country, and this is not far from one of the places where they are expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The notification of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came before 1 November,
the date on which this organisation settled in Haagu to Damascus for the purpose of destroying or decommissioning all chemical weapons and equipment for the purpose of mixing chemical substances for the purpose of producing liquid gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this in principle of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious time-frame which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the Damasjek must still start destroying existing weapons and resources.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical substances and weapons, including hypertensive and sarin gas.
The announcement came at a time when the war in Safira was fought on Thursday, where the expert was talking about a factory seat for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition, the Syrian Human Rights Watch said that he was living in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims in Syria through the network of activists announced on Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
It's supposed to be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar Asada's armed forces, 18,678 insurgents and 187 in Lebanese Hizballah.
There must also be 2,202 government fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN Organisation estimated that 100 000 people died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has brought about 2 million citizens to leave the country.
Asaad's units fought in Safire against the rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but she had no specific figures.
The wars have been undermining the danger facing inspectors for chemical weapons who are at their mission when they are in the midst of the continuing civil war in Syria to rescue the chemical arsenal, they must deal with strict terms.
In a statement by the OPCW, which is closely working with the UN, it was said that its team is now "repatriated to verify and monitor the destruction of the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and assembly/filling".
He added that "no other control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first inspection round when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said because I was worried about security, they weren't able to visit two places.
In the fourth quarter of the OPCW stated that these two sites were "replaced and ... items of the chemical weapons programme containing were moved into two other declared sites which were controlled".
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safire was one of the places the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed with its plan of complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Board next month.
"The petition goes beyond the state you have demonstrated when completing this most annual mission that this organisation once had," said observer director Ahmet Uzumcu in his comment by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, they stand against themselves in civil war, particularly the Sunniist Muslim rebels and the Hasad government with its security forces, which are full members of the Alawit sect, against Shiite Islam.
As for further development, the head of Observer Ramí Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion inside the anti-aircraft facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lakija.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Heat over the judgment of the founder of the bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and survivors of 202 people killed in the Bali bomb attack in 2002 responded with a clear response to the judgment of the last of the founders who were established before justice and said that Umar Patek should be corrected.
The path, which lasted almost 10 years as one of the most recent people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for forming an explosive device used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be released on condition.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder during an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people were left dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorist-related complaints, including a series of bombing attacks on churches in Indonesia on Friday evening of 2000.
The complaint required life, although it could take time for a man with the look of "Demolitation man" (bourach) thanks to his experience with the production of explosives.
This decision relived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost their 39-year-olds Jane and Jenny during the devastating attack by Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go to the other side.
Ms. Corteen's AAP agent said: "It should be set before the reading is corrected."
I have to live every day because I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was compared to the country when, on 12 October 2002, a strong investment was fired at 23 hours outside the parking lot.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds ago a suicide attacker fired bombs filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times “dead”.
Mr. Hughes said that Pataka should meet the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cells Jama Islama responsible for massacres – Amrosia, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were corrected four years ago.
This guy should be punished like nobody else.
Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
It's been 20 years since 202 people have been killed and hundreds of others have been injured, but it's not too much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the attackers on Bali.
The arrest was almost ten years away, but finally in January 2011 he was captured in the Pakistan City of Abbottábad, where, four months later, the American forces killed former leader Al-Kaidy Usam bin Ládin.
During the trial, an FBI agent announced in his testimony that reports of the reporting services found that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ládin in an attempt to re-connect the terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't volunteer," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much he has caused to others.
The Verdikt will come before the 10th anniversary of the attack that will take place later this year and which will belong to a ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of silence this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
The path can still be called against the judgment.
FAO: Passengers in air traffic can now use technology equipment in aircraft (but must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic device "from door to door" – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Travelers, but they should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as the change will take place according to individual airlines, FAO manager Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to submit FAO management as long as their aeroplanes comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the deck crew and the equipment management directives in order to comply with the new rules.
FAO stated that some airlines have already received plans to expand the use of mobile electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"On the basis of the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," FAO stated in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices when they close the airport door.
They cannot be stopped until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 km and the captain does not issue a permit.
From passengers it is expected that their equipment will be reopened once the plane is broken to stop and they will not stop until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic traffic may allow their passengers to use their equipment during air, landing and driving.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft which were managed to enable passengers to use Wifi at higher sea altitudes are expected to meet this criterion.
Laura Gladings, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the change.
"When new rules are safely introduced – and we will work together with transport companies – this will be a success," Gladings said in his statement.
We have already been honestly encouraged to look like a “looker. ”
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages or data storage will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometres of sea altitude, says the Agency.
The passenger will be notified to switch his smart phones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So there are still no Words with friends, online game type Scrabble that played here by Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, driven from American Airlines airport because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked in the harbor.
And more difficult devices like notebooks will have to be kept on because I'm afraid they could hurt someone if they flew off the cabin.
The phone calls will still be banned.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not apply to FAO, but the United States Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel a ban on certain electronic devices during flight and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenker of the State Security Committee on Transport, a national security expert at CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create pollution with navigational devices, but we also know from the FCC data that they can cause air pollution of transmitters," Rosenker said.
The Advisory Committee of the Board established by FAO to investigate this problem has proposed last month to allow the government to make greater use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been developed to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, claim there is no legal security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is widespread.
Some studies indicate that when a third of the passengers forgets the obligation to turn off their equipment or ignore it.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices travelling in 1966 in response to the destruction of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio, technical expenses of this period.
New airlines are much more related to electrical systems than those of previous generations, but they are also designed and approved by FAO to be resistant to electronic destruction.
Air carriers have already offered travel use of Wi-Fi for several years in the sea’s travel altitudes.
Plans designed for Wi-Fi systems are also more reliable against pollution.
Most airlines should be able to use more electronic devices within the framework of new rules, Huertov said.
Modern electronic devices generally reflect much less intensive radio transmission than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only issue minimal messages when turning pages.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices stop or transmit data.
Among those who are pressured to release restrictions on the use of these travel devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company installed their transport aircraft with their electronic reader Kindle and carried out a pilot flight, but no problem arose.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Passengers Association of Air Company said it is convinced that the destruction of these devices is real and even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee reported that there are only strict reports from pilots who should support the fact that such devices can cause air systems to be destroyed, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA pilots be allowed to order passengers to turn off their devices during flight according to low visibility devices.
The road industry group welcomed these changes and it said that it was a reasonable procedure for the travel public that technology is using to the detriment of the road.
"We are pleased that FAO has recognized that the pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported by plane from a garden in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found on a red surface in the Black Sea and released back into free nature.
One baptized was transferred to Aberdeen last month after she was previously infected by the Scottish SPCA in a safe medium until she recovered.
Colin Seddon said: "This is probably a Christian who migrated from northern Europe when he caught a strong wind over the North."
According to all of this, he's got his strength and he's got his ass on the rough surface.
Mr. Seddon added: "It was not possible to recover again, so we were contacted by requests for help."
When he was baptized, he was in good condition and in good health.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in depth with the commitment to connect companies and define what changes the EU wants to see British businesses and companies creating jobs.
To this end, we carried out the largest and most complex research that we asked the former British companies about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov asked 1,000 leading companies representing British companies of the most diverse sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the investigation will be surprising.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to measure beyond Europe and focus on the countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are arriving.
They want to see how the government prioritises new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil before they turn to a long and deliberate process of reforming the secret European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas – from monopolical regulations under producer laws – most companies expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The general concern with the single market and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations are now overestimating the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement has shown up to 40 per cent of large companies, thus traditionally the largest of European companies.
Finally, our investigation of leading companies has given us the most convincing recognition, and most of us would like Britain to agree on a change of contract and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The fact that companies of different sizes and major business groups have complained about it suggests that the business sector is pushing for a "sudden change" that has an impact on Britain.
In fact, there are many – reaching changes to the Treaty and better agreements for Britain can mean up to 16% in the EU referendum.
The President of the Government should not be concerned: this study shows that British trade supports its plan to renew the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to be a significant move from the current assessment of force back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and given the fact that the eurozone seems to be on its way to more and more economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels's regulatory approach.
John Kerry admitted: Cheating went too far!
The United States began to spy "too far" at times, according to AFP's chief American diplomat John Kerry at a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, the information collection served to counter terrorist attacks.
"First recognition from Washington," according to AFP, was launched in the middle of an early complaint on both coastal Atlantic due to the scandalous discovery of joint monitoring of data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which also became an American alliance.
"In some cases, I admit, just as President Barack Obama did, some of these actions have gone too far and we ensure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
But in the conversation, he was primarily involved in customs practices.
The collection of information is considered necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks, such as attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings were exploding and people were killed because we were able to be informed at times about the stocks," Kerry stressed.
However, he admitted again that the collection of information "in some cases has gone quite far".

Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the waste in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
Initiation of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, Gazpromo said.
"We are witnesses to the border today: The construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
The demand for South Stream should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The agreement between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, says the officials.
Miller says that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risk associated with transit countries has been removed.
As the entire project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at reduced prices.
The company Gazprom says that the construction has to start in other countries towards the end of this year.

Hizballah sent thousands of soldiers to Syria.
He's waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese invasion of Hizballah has deployed 15 000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle on the Horn of Kalamun.
According to Israel’s reports, in two locations in western Syria, in the middle of the Middle Ages, missiles were destroyed by the right hand of Hizballah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting on the side of the Syrian army.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which is not mixed up in the Syrian conflict, but clearly stated that the ban on the movement of weapons into the hands of Hizballah into Lebanon.
The reports on Israel's average arms embargoes in Western Syria are just as clear.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but American sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean Sea by the Syrian rocket base Snubar Jjabla south of Latvia.
The Al-Arabi reporting station claims that there were two stocks in which rockets were prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was about the rockets of the Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but military analyst Ron Ben Jishaj said that Syria is constantly trying to capture the missiles of Hizballah and the Syrian plane teaches members of the armed section of Hizballah with rockets.
SA-8 is an old rocket that has a Syrian army since the '80s.
They're placed on the mobile van.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small sizes it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with radar, but they're fired after the fire, so it's hard to measure them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in the area inhabited by ruling alavites.
It's a well-defined area, and Hizballah has just been involved in the wars in Western Syria in the past.
He claims it helps to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the valley belongs.
Now it is likely that 15 000 of his warriors are ready to help get the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hizballah there, the Syrian army also strengthens its units.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the country of Homs.
The battle must be directed by the sources of al-Arabia for a recent attack on the leadership of the Syrian Shirt Brigadier-General of Fadla Abbase in the Shiit-Shiji part of Damascus.
Hisballah helped the Syrian army this year to defeat the city of Kussir at the Lebanese border.
Many rebels from Kussyura went right to Kalamun.

According to the results of the vote, the majority of the citizens could have expressed this position.
That they were not actually aware of this and that the situation that was there (the stealing and charging of this state) was actually calm.
In other words, I cannot explain that 3,413 497 voters did not get to the vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted by ODS in total, 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all eligible voters.
Which is a half-life.
In the case of the above-mentioned parties, 1 016 829 ČSSD voters, then with an old order (because all of these parties participated in the "selling" and debt of the State), 64.23% of the eligible voters agreed with this position.
In fact, the majority of voters have indicated that they are not responsible for the prosecution of the perpetrators of the theft and the submission of the State.
Or do you think the members of the ČSSD who shared the principles of the respective laws?
Do we have any help?

The Royal Commission found that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) were charged before complaints against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Committee on Sexual Abuse of Children found that before the charge against child abuse was brought against Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children.
However, the Commission noted that in its initial statement to the Commission, this association indicated that in its organisation there has never been a case of sexual abuse of a child.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned when one of YMCA's employees was accused of child pornography offences, and another, when a physical nurse in Caringbah from YMCA was sentenced in 1991 to sexual harassment of children who were in their care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the committee's consultant, he knew about the first case, but not the second one.
He admitted that the statement of initiation of the YMCA association was also unclear when he stated that external audits were carried out in the YMCA organisation, which were assessed by this organisation as a previous suspension of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission refers to the fact that the YMCA was noted for having received the second of the four lowest possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society of Serbia this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA Association when he was 21, admitted that his leadership was slowed down by his own direction, when Mr. Lorda agreed, without checking whether his staff had been obliged to report violations of the child's safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to sexual harassment by 12 boys who had been admitted for two years when he was working in the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting child safety violations to Mr. Lord.
Members gave evidence that they were witnesses of such abuses, including that Lord was with the children on his own, that he kept them sitting on his desk, told them that he liked them, and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, found that Jacqui Barnat, who was leading the child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to. ”
The Director-General said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt bad if they should contact their superiors and report the results.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had blinded their judgment, and that is why they had no problem.
Mr. Hare said that the board of YMCA in New South Wales expressed his opinion that learning from Jonathan Lord's "case" for the organization begins with the fact that the staff "did not give a message" and agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign the agreement on confidentiality shortly after the complaint was made by the Director-General for Child Services of the YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the purpose was to avoid breach of evidence, but it was "exploitedly hot" and was wrong.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual exploitation of children, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children in 2009 to 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the congregation, checking, working, training and staffing.
The hearing was dismissed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the opportunity to return to the post of the Prime Minister, but he admitted that it was unlikely that he would return.
In the evening conversation on the fifth anniversary of his departure from the 59-year office, the policy expressed its views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when Mr Blair has been away from the lead post for ten years, he has mostly avoided talks on British politics and has restricted his comments to foreign affairs and his role in sending the Biscao Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of the Prime Minister, his answer to the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted him as saying: "Yes, of course, but it's probably hard to do so, so..."
While in Cardiff, representatives of experts gathered on horse leadership to fight for the price of the Year's Horse, it was clear that competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for the three-year Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet going to school and just a few months ago made his first steps, this boy and his animal kitten, Shetland Pony Toffee, the coolers crossed three cars to finally get the main price and leave 30 adult contestants behind.
These decisive two – with the same height – were held at the Sunnybank railway centre in Rudry’s village near Cardiffu for the view, behaviour and style of each year.
He set himself against the lords and ladies in elegant clasps, put his bar in a happy role and let his two-year-old Toffey walk around the circle.
Fenton was commended for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his vision and personality.
Fenton Toffey was born in March to his third birthday and has been having a daily party with this Shetland poet since then.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee work well."
They didn't have a great hope, but eventually they left with a gold reward and a kiss.
It was just the opposite of what Toffe was competing with, and when he won, we were excited.
They all considered him to be a phenomenal, and people of all sorts wanted to take a photo with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes to his aunt Sharon Howells, who runs horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was excited and excited."
He ran after the sand all along the arena and, although he did so little, he performed great performance.
Fenton is owned by animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and has got two cooks.
In view of how he started, it'll be soon for the horse of the year and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
The speaker of each year's horse show said: "Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony."
They're creating a great team together.
The natives brought out Fenton and Toffey for their outstanding performances and for the way in which they took place in the competitive area.
They're always watching how well the team's work is between the pony and the one who's leading it - and Fenton and Toffee were the best.
I'm sure Fenton's been able to help out with a nice dress. He really fell in there with him.
Too much strange news should be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the title page requested the release of the reporter charged with the speech, will be investigated on a thorough basis, said the press manager.
News New Express sat in Guangzhou made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking a fee to create stories about the company partially owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper would now carry out "full adjustment".
The "justice" regulation came from the State Department for Printing and Publications, Advertising, Film and Television in the province of Kuang-tung.
The previous investigation showed that in the period from September 2012 to August 2013, the New Express from the Nangcheng group Eventing News issued a number of incorrect reports on that company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express news was not organized," said the manager in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose Chen Yongzhou's administrative penalty on the press in such a way as to cancel a press licence".
He also "ordered the Nangcheng Group Evening News to complete the New Express list and recommended that the responsible persons in New Express examine it and immediately change the New Express guide list".
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles dealing with financial differences in company with the construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his papers published on the title page two requests for his release and claimed they were responsible for his journalism.
Mr. Chen, however, appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false stories on the payroll.
"In this case, I have caused harm to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to build public confidence," said the CCTV State Reporting Station.
I did it mostly because I've been shopping for money and fame.
I realize I've been wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he published a New Express letter on the title page of an apology in which he indicated that he was late when he did not have enough control over his message.
In recent times, a number of closely identified suspects have been identified on television.
Experts say that the recognition is still regularly withdrawn, regardless of the change in the law of the year which prohibits the authorities to force anyone to blame himself.
Found a tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most industrial tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railways, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of dimensions once a meter as one of the most industrial secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of almost six football games, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of unexplained warehouses where freight vehicles can be easily hidden before drug use.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel had been closed before drug shipments could be unobstructed.
The authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine together with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who worked under the authority as drivers were charged with holding marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of a review, the penalties shall be lifted from 10 years to after life.
In Nogales, Arizona, shepherds enter large waterways.
The tunnel is the eighth largest walk ever revealed in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered in October after the Marihuan glass in central Mexico, which is facing problems before the drug cartels as soon as possible with their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walk of about 650 metres, equipped with bicycles, which led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the Centre offer management.
Offered example of joint Insertion
A new integrated newsroom of the economy in Prague.
The economy has taken another step towards transforming the Centre into its media home.
From the fifth, Economie and Centre have a common top management.
"The integration of the organisational structure and the staff of the Union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," comments the Vice-President of the Economy and Deputy Director-General Kamil Čermák.
The German who will be in charge of a single management will complement the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new trade manager was Paul Voparíil, who was also appointed by the director of the two company Zuzan Tilcher.
The new head of information technology became Stépán Burd.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piscáček, whose team is also the director of Jacob Unger's transformation.
Adela Pitts was entrusted with the new set-up role of the marketing director.
Self-defence of corporate communication new leader of the Lothian Faith.
The co-financing director is Karel Žalud, who manages human resources for both of the publishers of Petra Slavá.
"The new organisational structure will also enable us to reach the market with a joint offer of insert products, better to promote the creation of the content of all the titles issued and, in the last few years, further significantly improve the business management of the company," Čermák added.
The Economics company, which owns the Bakal Wall, has concluded a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of the year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Currently.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, expanded e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of other dozens of smaller websites.
The economy company is the publisher of economic news, IHNED.cz reporting server, weeks of respect and economics and the number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers is the most long-term success in the sale of digital versions of their main titles.
This year, in June, the publisher moved to the newly built modern premises in Prague, Karlina.
CME's on TV business.
He'll miss almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be missing.
By the end of the year, he wants to protect thousands of people.
He wants to focus on his main business, television.
The group, which owns and operates in Czech TV Nova and also operates in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
That's how almost a quarter of the people get to work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is a company of CET 21, which holds licenses to send TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smichov, Telka and Czech versions of MTV.
How much support will be given to Česka, where the group employs 650 people, and what this will mean for the Turkish television unit TV Nova, it is still unclear.
"It's early and we can't really comment on it," said the director of Novy Josef Koukoliček communication.
According to the MF DNES information, the sharp release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be excluded, but the far-reaching impact on the CME staff position in Romania and other countries.
Both new Chiefs of News Christoph Mainush and Michael Del Nin, who were behind Adrian Sarbu's long-term director, spoke during a mid-term conference with analysts about their desire to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly limit the cost of production of its own order, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, the ice cream burned at night
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a large-scale storage plant was burned, according to the founders, apparently a cold spring.
"The fire consumed the fire on Thursday night before eleven o'clock in the evening, the fire was still burning today," announced the speaker of the Polish poet Paul Adamc.
The amount of damages in the air in the environment did not exceed the allowed limit according to the measurement.
More damage and fire causes are still unknown.
In the area in Kolbeno Street, there gradually reached a peak of five tenths of the passengers.
"It's about the fire of a great-equipped container, probably cold-cold," Adamc said.
"In the area there is no functional hydrant network, so we cut through the transport of tanks," she added.
According to the Tn.cz server, it was complicated to shut down the badly functioning hydrant network, so drivers had to get water out.
The director of the fire department reported a second degree of fire-fighting.
There are at least four of them, and in the most serious situations, there are four of them.
Chemicals have also emerged to verify the peace of dangerous substances that could be found in the fire.
"But they didn't find any damages in the air that would violate hygiene standards," said the speakers.
The British police gave Assange a notice of extradition
The British police today gave a notice of the release of Founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard announced that he had given Australia's 40-year notice of expulsion by asking him to get to the police station and that if he does not do so, he could be threatened by arrest.
Assange, under the British law, seized his opportunity when the Supreme Court dismissed his refusal to issue this month, and he was thus sent to Sweden for prosecution of sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would take him to the United States, he was looking for a shelter at the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard "has given notice of a 40-year-old man asking to be delivered to the police station on the day and hour that he was assigned," said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate the terms of the case.
The High Commissioner refused to receive a notice of publication.
Assange is afraid that he will be released from Sweden to the United States where he may face Spanish charges because on the WikiLeaks website he published 250 000 American diplomatic documents.
The driver got fired 1,000 pounds because he was more than 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist obtained 1,000 pounds for eating up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from the city of Tiptree in Essex was on 27 May in his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out she had a drink between her legs.
In Colchester Howay's police court, he admitted to the charge that he was being misdirected and unattended.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month order.
It was also proposed to pay the costs of 90 pounds and an excuse for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of the tax on owners of foreign properties of the London Stock Exchange
The Ministry of Finance originally calculated the tax on the cost of financial property, but is waiting for the final decision of Mr Osborne, which presented 7 % for transfer of property at the price of buildings over 2 million free of charge and annual payments for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
Exemption from the transfer of property in the housing fund in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which reached 708 million pounds in 2012/13, has already exceeded the total account for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-West, North-West-West-West-West-West-West-West-West-West-West-West.
Mr. Cook said: "In view of the increase in the transfer of property to houses of high value and the representation of legislation that should prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that property of high value is little taxed, regardless of the effect of the old tax system."
He added that "this step could have caused certain foreign investors to hesitate to buy property in London, if any, the existing owners are reluctant to sell".
Previous real estate – up 5 % to 10% of the housing market at prices – in the rich sand that flows from Fulham after Wimbledon, increased by 11.8 % in the last year.
The prices in the middle of London continue to show an annual steady growth of 5.6 % but were replaced by the attractive ‘home market’ which, according to a study by the Savills Real Office of the Southwest, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) increased.
Scientists have shed more light on how the movement of danger is related to dog behavior
Previous studies have shown that gladiatorial dogs are responsible for more transport (from the dog’s perspective), while nervous dogs have a relatively lower risk.
Now, however, scientists say that the other dogs will prove these fascinating differences in the movement of danger recorded and responded to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at Trento University, said: "People well know that the left and right sides of the brain have a wide range of connections to companies that stimulate positive or negative emotions."
That's what we've been trying to warn others.
He added that just as it is in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain is responsible for left movement and on the other hand, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an attempt to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate repetition of the impact of other dogs, researchers have monitored animals that were watching films on other dogs.
They measured the frequency of these animals and analysed their behavior.
It won't be long before we understand why their eyes sometimes go one way and another.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have forgotten dogs films about dogs – whether in a natural version or like a silhouette – to escape any mussels, and we have also been able to correct the movement of the cat and to observe it more directly or to the left."
When the animals saw a different unexplained dog moving through a transport hazard (from the point of view of the killing dog), they remained quite calm.
However, when it noted that there was a large amount of damage left (again from the view of the dog returning), their temperature increased and the animals were not sure.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
It is more likely that dogs have learned from experience what moves they must make and what they must not pay attention to.
He said: "If you meet dogs several times and move their tails in one direction, it is repeatedly connected with more friendly behavior and the movement of the fruit is less friendly, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that finding out can help dogs, veterinarians and athletes better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a high school animal education teacher at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side are important for dogs.
Last year a team from Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head left when they look at the aggressive dog and right when they look at the fun dog.
And in another professional union from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “I was working with dogs with greater probability when he turned to the left than when transport became uncertain – exactly contrary to the Italian study.”
The difference may be based on the fact that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or dogs did not appear to be quite like dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs respond to real dogs.
"Since there is abundant evidence in the case of many different pigs that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it's probably not going to take long before we understand why their eyes sometimes go on one side and the other on the other.
Arctic Monkeys because of Alexe Turner's violence led a concert in Glasgow
The rock band Arctic Monkeys held a concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with heart attack.
The Sheffield group was supposed to appear on Friday in the city complex Hydro.
The disease of the main singer Alex Turner, however, caused her to move.
The notification of the group came after similar contributions were made to postpone the fourth exhibition in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official websites, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After a decision to postpone today's LG outbreak in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys Group must also postpone the outbreak in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with breast cancer and unfortunately will not be able to appear."
The LG arena in Birmingham is so effective on 20 November and the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All lists of these exhibitions remain in force.
We would like everyone who bought the tickets to apologize for the inconveniences that led to it.
If you need more information, please contact the customer service at the warehouse where you bought your lists.
Pope Francis names in the basement of the first cardinal
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22 February first named the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinals have the highest position in the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are those who like the pope, so Frantisek will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer take part in the pope’s elections – the group is thus reduced to 120 volunteer cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals, the gathering of contemporary cardinals known as a consitor will end.
"Papèž František has decided to forward his decision to the U.S. Consistency Consistency in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, from the list of Catholic Voices, said that the number of cardinals in the universe is likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually named as many cardinals as necessary to increase the number of voters to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The Consitorium next year will be important because it will be the first time that Frantiszek was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At this point there are certain guidelines for Europe and Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore equality," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only an odd number of cardinals.
It will also be discussed on the first election of cardinals since the establishment of the Council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been tasked to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope had decided everything for himself.
"Ninny Frantisek chose these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it's "almost possible" that these cardinals ask for advice.
In this situation we have never been before – it's a simple news item.
Valero said that the popes traditionally elevated the position of cardinals of the bishops from large places, but Francisk is "full of surprise – so we don't know who he is".
GM is building some new light commercial cars in the United States because of the repair of seating
According to a fifth notification from the American Car Safety Authority, General Motors is about 19,000 of its new (2014) light-duty vehicles Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sirra to conduct a race with manual braking.
In some of these vehicles, there may be a mechanism for filling the front seats of the vehicle.
As a result, seating services are not in accordance with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that "if the rear vehicle gets hit, the head restraint must not be properly protected, which increases the risk of traffic".
Loaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM has placed a supply on the market in June and for this former American car, it is the most important introduction of a vehicle into the market since its restructuring in 2009.
The GM informed the owners of the charges for the start-up in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification to the owners of the 16-day government failure which in October reduced the sales of cars.
The sales of the supply of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, increased by approximately 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year in the fifth year of GM.
In October GM sold its delivery 42 660 Silverado models and 16 503 Sierra models.
New York’s shares grew on Friday by 1.4 per cent to 37.47 USD.
A reliable cry of Obama's voter

He says Obama's sincere efforts have blocked the obstacles of the Republican party
Obstacle policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama’s health care sites or attacks on non-pilot aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memories are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard in the second year.
I read a really sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the dark days of my second year at the medical school, he would wake me up and give me back hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a reminder of Baracka Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patient's exams tonight and I go to bed, it's my book back to the time when the politics inspired millions of people and the performances took you breath.
The elections ended with a slow movement and television reports forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My colleagues cried out with joy, and my parents hid the papers they had gathered.
In the White House a young team of visionists was headed for the scene, and the people were ready to change.
During the introduction to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent support.
And here I'm closing the book.
Getting to the moment is a tough exercise, like going to sleep.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, sad memories of missed opportunities.
In the years after I entered my first ballot, it really came to change.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I am aware that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on care available through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “no questions, no words” after the death of Usami bin Ládin.
In addition, I am convinced that foreign barriers have made so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is an immigration reform, a public choice of health care and closure of basics in Guantánamo.
But after a lot of situations when I defended Obama's administration before my colleagues and friends, I, in terms of the explanation they can provide, reached an absolute limit.
I felt in a place of political despair.
Obstacles to the Republican can not explain the agreement with the refusal of foreign leaders or with the flight of unmanned planes killing innocent children in exile.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the United States or that it detects those who abuse the government.
They cannot be held responsible for correcting Anwar al-Awlakí, an American citizen, without proper trial, or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot be justified by the discovery of reports that say that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are “more aggressive... than Nixon's administrators”.
And the latest cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing a simple web page law.
I don't know if something like this happened.
I thought at 18 years of age I should have guessed that government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns that have taken place.
The wanted function is obviously not a predictive process and our public talks will create an opposition political party and an adverse event such as a massacre in Newton.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above appear to be the result of the administrative decision itself.
And that's what bothers me most.
I loved them both again in 2012, but not because I was inspired by his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unexplained alternative and seemed unable to determine his policy or position.
I felt that the second working period for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, was the full hope we've ever heard of.
However, it is to return to 2008 – with the support of Obama this week of less than 45 % – through this book, which continues to be more difficult.
It's encouraging me to remember this number of promises they've lost.
This week, I read in the book a chapter about how Obama suffered a wild defeat with Clinton at the first recorded in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to time and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our shirt back," he said.
We can't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I'll just agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this comment are the very views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that the president of the government Tony Abbott is concerned about the parental permission programme
The billionaire and Ambassador Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is concerned about the interests of the parental programme, because his daughters can run away and get away from it.
The banana magnet, which leads the dispute over the compensation for the oil tax rate of $6 million, made this claim when he tried to get out of the table the question of whether he was in interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate which play a key role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and steel.
But Mr. Palmer said that in terms of interest, only ministers could be concerned, and he added that Abbott's daughters were in a position when they could have personally benefited from this policy.
"He got to a great deal of interest about a place of parental leave, because if any of his daughter had moved away, he would have a direct interest in whether she would have received parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the vote, the vote committee officially announced Mr Palmer's victory in the fight against the Fairfax cross in the Sunshine Coast area thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an examination of the voluntary results to speed up the process.
Dcery Tony Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the election?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, put details into the computer, vote immediately and have results in half the seventh night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of cassettes to mark voting papers.
Is it that the results can get worse if they don't like someone?
In these days and at this time, the use of heavy metals seems unbelievable.
The Voluntary Commission studied the possibility of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme was also related to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The public authority is a public service.
"We do not insist on any reward except that we can serve companies in this critical time," he said.
Do you have your hands?
The scientists have come to see that they're holding your hands against you.
The experiment was attended by 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two were supposed to solve the unsolved role.
Of course, they didn't both.
But the group that did wash their hands after the accident caused much more optimism than the one where her participants did not.
Also, the group "with your hands tied" carried better in the next test than the other one.
Yet those who wash their hands have achieved even worse results in other tests than those who did not have them.
The results of the "dead" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not record any previous failures.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that physical cleanliness really removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, complex motivations, testing must be concentrated much more in the other trials.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the WC.
After the use of the WC, only one percent of Czech and Czech people have their hands, but on the way to town transport it's already five.
For hygiene, most people will also work in the garden or in the rural area when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The weakening of the home baby is causing 78.7 percent of the people to die.
A recent study revealed that there was a difference in the attention of Czechs and Slovaks as much as it is necessary to wash your hands after handing a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 per cent of Czechs and 40.3 per cent of Slovaks are engaged.
The study showed that both nations wash their hands ten times a day.
"Even if it is on the spot, I fear that the reality is different and people are trying to do so a little better," commented researcher Claudia Komárkov.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to the two persons concerned, the situation is suspended by the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) by two traders in its division of foreign exchange, which is another indication that the global investigation of the control authorities in relation to suspicious machine machines with the exchange market is becoming more and more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including BB, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the competent authorities in the world’s largest financial market, where the owner changes $5.3 billion each day.
The reference of two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the scope of the expanded investigation, which is a reference to the LIBOR manipulating scandal (London Interbank Rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension but confirmed that this month had received an information request from the authorities.
"Our non-exhaustive effort in this matter continues and we are fully working with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank announced two weeks ago.
Last month, people who are close to this event indicated that the RBS submitted to the British financial authority the e-mails and rapid messages sent from the accounts and from the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, abandoned the RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position of the European Trade President with foreign exchange to JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President for cash-making in Citi, came this week, while Matt Gardiner, former trade leader at Barclays and BB, was suspended this week by the Standard Chartered company.
Not one of these traders was charged with any crime.
The bankers from Barclays and Citigroup joined Mr. Usher's group to send a quick message, saying people were committed to this event.
This week, the Bank of BB has stated that after the Swiss authorities announced that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange machines in several Swiss banks, it has taken steps against some of its employees.
At least six of the world’s offices – the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Anti-Monopol Office of Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the United States and the Mining Office in Hong Kong – are testing the claim that these banks have joined in moving to the exchange market.
In addition, HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse were said to have submitted an internal investigation or a request from the relevant authorities.
Banks spend years reading old news and e-mails to find cases of some crime.
The investigation reports were alarmed by traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for the creation of profits in investment banks' closures in the past years, but which was damaged by the fact that my small disability prevented me from taking advantage of speculants.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that a wide and high liquidity market with a foreign currency is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high positions of traders say that this must not be true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trade with foreign exchange of liquidity testing between the various trading platforms and banks increasing their domestic platforms, "you can start to have market impact at a relatively low price."
The report came on that day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she had left her trade department for shares of a trader that had caused almost US$6 million by the end of last year.
The Bank immediately warned the relevant authorities and cooperated with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader has dealt with himself and that this problem has been solved," the Credit Suisse Society said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have already recorded more than a thousand people with HIV virus.
From the beginning of the investigation in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of the year, the test confirmed the ban in total 1005 persons from the metropolis.
This is due to national reference laboratory statistics for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, there were still 2,063 orders throughout the PRC.
The 396 immunodeficiency syndrome has already disappeared.
198 people died.
The number of registered in the Czech Republic in the last decade is growing annually.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, 121 years later.
In 2009, the investigation rejected 156 new orders and then 180 in 2010.
The proposed number fell to 153, but the line was recorded.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"The total number of new diagnosed cases this year is over 200, which I believe is no doubt," said the expert on the problem of AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who brought this year to the Prague Light House for Patients.
From October to the end of the year 2011, the tests found a ban on 39 people and last year 47, Hlavatý.
In September, 21 new patients and three patients were enrolled.
From the start of the monitoring to the end of the HIV test, 1710 men and 353 women confirmed.
The AIDS disease spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know some town should be on the ground.
His visit reveals more than a visit to the start-up centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than he had built a dome.
A lot of people are reading from the grave.
Little by little, the peacocks slow down and get an intimate view of the local reality.
They find out what people here live here, what nationalities they are, what beliefs, how large and supportive families belong, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their common position, which they have experienced.
And they will find out from their graves how they care for their dead.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that Barack Obama's health care law is in line with the Constitution, which is a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
By means of vote 5:4 the Court decided that the individual regulation on the protection of patients and available care – which arranges for citizens to buy health insurance by 2014, or threatens to pay the bill – does not support the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court of Justice, John Roberts, stood next to four more liberal members of the court while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which requires States to extend the possibility of obtaining disability insurance, is, in the event of an adverse risk of leaving all funding for disability insurance from federal resources, is not taxable and contrary to the law.
The application was made for the purpose of blocking this law by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 tender, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
For the word "Mugabe is a dirty village" is no longer a dangerous prison, the court has broken the law.
To date, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they talk to the public about the Nineteenth-Year Mugabe, which has been ruling the country since the beginning of the 1980s, since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, however, for the removal of the Presidential Authority, the cost of $100 per year was jeopardised.
"The representatives of the State should not be strongly accused of persons who charge the President in the economy or in other public places," said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
The nine judges unanimously agreed that the law would protect freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government is calling against the decision of the court, informed by the British BBC.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Dang, who had been arrested two years ago by the police, were reportedly arrested by the president during the arrest of the police officer in the bar.
In May he ended up in prison for opposition activists attending Mugabe's public service as a "cule village".
In July, the prosecutor accused a 60-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared anti-constitutional law limiting freedom of the media.
"The state can't count on people whose declaration later appears to be false," said the mayor of Justice, Luke Malala.
To date, the same Zimbabwean law has allowed the person who publishes false information to be judged as a complainant for 20 years.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalisation of someone for a false declaration has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe's government has been firmly committed for more than 33 years, a new constitution with wider civil rights was adopted in Zimbabwe in March on the basis of the referendum.
A few steps from the dictatorship of one man occurred in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition resulted in the prime minister's cross by Morgan Tswangarje.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the world's highest inflation that exceeded 100 000 per cent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished national change.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paid for by other countries.
The proposed economy is headed by an uneven agricultural reform of Mugabe.
In 2000, he divided the land of white farmers between his breeders and war veterans.
However, most of them did not have any experience with walking on the farm.
Central banks will maintain swap lines for the duration
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Federation, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool that will enable banks to access global exchanges whenever they need them.
The banks reported it in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economy of the London bank of Barclays.
"All the transitional tools of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not in my opinion any surprise," adds Vojtêch Banda, BH Security's main economy.
The central banks strengthen the gap which began to emerge in 2007, when the international credit market was first terminated.
The central banks' agreements have made it possible to access euro, dollars and other exchanges of any person who needed them.
The decision of central bankers will come at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing for the end of its US economic support programme, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract shall be used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the same time as the transfer of another currency.
It can be understood as a contribution of one exchange and a loan of another exchange.
The ECB shall initiate a third attempt to return trust to the European Bank.
The EU has agreed to a bank surveillance, the ECB will look at 150 banks.
As Tipsport (not) makes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't end up here next time, 'cause there was just someone who couldn't finish online registration.
And because I didn't want to move on another side, I lost my record, and then I moved away, so I changed my address and the number of civilian evidence.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it wasn't going to work because I had another OP number, the address, and that it just didn't go to finish it, and that I had to ask for data recovery and for a new registration.
So I did that and on 24 October 2013, I wrote on technical support that I would request the payment of all my personal data from the database under the law applicable to the protection of personal data.
On that spiritual day, she gave me technical support that I had to complete my registration on the border.
So he started e-mail maraton on technical support, where he finally wrote 25.10 after 4:00 a.m., that personal data was deleted on my request.
The person would then say that he could carry out that new registration, and here the problems started again before I wrote that my user name is already contained (the understanding was not reduced - no personal data, but it was finally set up).
So I used another user name and jumped up on me that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration on the site (how can I have something that claims to have been removed?), so I contacted again with technical support.
On my question, how can I be denied that my personal data really exceeded 25.10. and that I should send an e-mail with that error?
I did this (about 15 p.m. yesterday) and I was told today that I was registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that this is why I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been in touch with technical support for a week now and I've decided it's not going to work.
And what about if it were true what it claims (as it is not) that no one could be registered with the same name or date of birth if it has already been registered?
Only through those 13.22s I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the thought-made e-mail and phone number and the world wild, it turned out to me that the site sent me a link to the end of the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register on the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs the registration on e-mail and phone number and data just doesn't tell how it says.
So I once again gave this technical support that they're just lying (whether they're mentally or they don't know what they're writing), because what they're writing is not true.
I pointed out a few screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. So "fashion" registration just doesn't have any effect on this.
I'm sorry you're already registered, but we can't verify your claim.
And communication's over.
The respectives shall also repeat the same sentence that the registration is based on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and did not even take place.
So if it's bullshit, Tipsport's not just that he didn't get the data as he claims, but he's still lying when he claims it.
Worse, it's easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the mistake is on the customer's side.
Through the introduction of this responsibility on my personal blog, things were a little moving, and from Technical Support e-mailed that the matter was referred to and I will be informed (after a week of emergency, receipt and warning of the same error).
In the metre on the Bridge, music is playing
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague has launched the project of Music in the metre.
The first note where during the operation of the metre, the reproducated instrument song is the A Bridge at the entrance to Václavský village.
The test shall take six months.
Michal Horaček presented his new two albums, a hat and three songs
The editor of Michal Horáček brought into the hall of the Colinian City Society House not only his completely new twoCD Czech calendar, but in particular in order to include songs from Lenku New, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla delivered by Orchestra Mátje Bank.
After the initial intrusion and the heretic studio about the late musician Michal Horáček gradually invited all three songs to the stage, he himself came up with a candle in his hand and reminded him of the story of how they had finally played in the Colin and the theater and the entire city had an electric current.
"But in Colin there were two types of cards that I've been very close to," he recalled.
So did the parents of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour by the Zakolanes or Dübravce in Bratislava," he tweeted about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horaček, who didn't leave the candle and if he didn't talk, sat in the chair with a glass of wine, touched his new musical performance.
The calendar also made Joseph Mánes, who gave it on the eagle, about the ice hockey, but this time he didn't know how we fit in these places and we're complaining about who doesn't jump, it's not Czech.
That's what's called one of the songs from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang for him from this board a lot of good sleep in the day, singing after night and taking care of her on the guitar.
If he didn't sing, he was playing percussion, then all three songs were made by capillaries, violoncello, guitar and corbassa.
All three vocalists joined in singing a little cigarette To the heart of the sitter who immediately broke the search.
"I'm glad that this song caught you, which didn't surprise me in the city of Kmoch," responded Michal Horáček.
After referring to Petra Hapku, I was surprised at the fact that Franciška Segrada, originally awarded by Richard Müller, was awarded a large applause, and that his father, Han Heger, was pleased with Lídu Bara and with the horror explanation of the communist ban and the reward of the Baro's American heretic Mae West.
Founder Michael Kocába recalled the story of Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful song of Praha by Jarodo Freebodo, the late cousin and the former Colinák.
But it was already the end, the state-of-the-art play and the contribution in the form of an optimistic fund We live in a wonderful time.
The playlist was ready for another addition, but the fans didn't show up.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire quarter sat on the table to sign not only the Czech calendar but also the older CD, Michal Horáček even took his books and even both from the legendary LP and with the interested parties she took photos.
Berdycha with Stépánk complements Rosol and Hajek
At the end of Davis' campaign against Serbia, he appointed the play-in-chief of Czech tennis stars Jaroslav Navrátli, four-star Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štépanek, Lukaš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The common representatives of the trophies are busy, but they are going to play on the match to the White House, where the game is actually on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the finals, there's a quarter of Czechs in the last five years.
"We know we're going on a hot ground that it's going to be weird and we have to focus as always on our performance."
"We'll go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell it best," said Štépanek, the master of the winning point in the London terminal with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American Command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites had just outlined how it would look to the Syrian bombing.
Without the excess noise, threats, and millions of announcements, the planes were sent, they set their goal and returned.
Unless they can get caught up in the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
The entire action refuses to confirm and no longer expresses itself.
The exact opposite is confused and enormous, actions not supported by Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most comforting thing about the whole attack was what the Israelites were bombing.
Do not allow yourself to be confused by their claims that they were bombed by "the Syrian base" or "the supplies for Hisbalah".
I've recently been writing here about that while helping the U.S. secular rebels in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia is still happy to supply Syrian weapons.
And just the pure supply of Russian rockets set out in the port of Latakia became the means of the Israeli invasion.
A clear message.
And remember, Israel once again bombed Asaad's regime, no matter how popular it should be, according to popular internet theories.
The US government has appointed two members of space units, probably Delta Force.
It wasn't until now that they were known for the American Consulate in Benghazi.
It's known as the garden death of two former SEALs officers who invaded the CIA area in the city, and I think it was about the CIA secret team members who were created by former soldiers.
It was long speculated what SEALs did to the consulate or even to the rest of the CIA's residence.
Now it's clearer.
However, the information that the CIA has its official protected against colloquy iron in Libya (just one of the two members of SEALs have died after the fall) is somewhat surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two still unknown heroes.
They were members of the American team in Tripoli, and when they received the report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to join the invasion and, together with five private contractors, fired their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
The Administrative Ombudsman regrets the fact that during that attack, that command was not officially and completely imposed and that it was simply a matter of what to do.
The commander of the team will probably release these volunteers without orders.
Anyway, it's not a single country but an American team, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting information.
And this is because until recently there has been no such thing as this, and it's only about any NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States is still trying to defeat terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would help to solve the national situation, it would be a lot more helpful.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write today is the border of Iran.
It's not as long as the media almost revealed the Iranian air forces to catch American drones.
However, it is little known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if an attempt is made to reveal its drone in the air, it won't do anything about it.
However, if the Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom flight was following an American drone in the international sea area when it might have arrived at the first extreme of the discovery of the American Super F-22 Raptor in history.
This guy flew Phantom to check his weapon optically without having to record it on the radar or just watch it and then suddenly appeared at him and called an Iranian pilot back home, he listened without question.
It's no wonder that Phantom's a year old American products that remember the war in Vietnam.
Raptor can't be compared.
We want to show that Plenary is still able to win, promises the Raittoral.
It's a little paradox.
While his team will not be able to deliver its results in particular in recent times, the defendant or founder of Viktorie Plzeň František Rajtoral has the form that led him to return to represent year after year.
He's got shots, he's got an activity, and after a while he's been in Teplic's meeting, there's been a knockout.
Victoria went out in the last two cars against Slavia and in the Templicas after victory, but finally she took one point out of these two duels.
Frantisjek Raittoral believes his team is breaking up with Jablonce's unacceptable series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that Jablonec will be defeated at home," promises František Raittoral.
The men are preparing carefully for the heavy game with the Severochs who play the attack football.
Everything leads to contact with Jablonce, the trainer prepares us well, as we always get a lot out of the video game competition.
"I believe this will be a great party on Friday evening," says a Czech fanist at Doosan Areny's court.
The last attacks didn't come as expected, but Victoria's defense crisis is rejected.
So it's going in the football, sometimes you have a good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again," said Western defense.
Victoria's husband will again rely on the support of fans.
"He's playing on Friday night and I'd like to invite our great fans."
"I believe we're going to give them a victory," Raittoral adds.
Jan Five: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not really about the step, it's about the big jump -- the jump about a few years back, and it's about my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just get out of school and get rid of supplies, get out and do your job.
Even though these "compulsions" were mostly theory, parental expectations.
Praxe was completely different - get out of school, throw a bag into the kitchen and run out.
Play games with other kids, kick your ass.
Then at Helena's series, and her boys, they're going to develop a rheumatic taste for the baby for birth.
And then, after a few warnings, you finally know that it's a commodity, get rid of it, in the winter carry wood into rocky stones and work to do it until it's planted under the lamp (or rely on the partner and instead of the task to write favorite verses of school love).
Early in the morning, hand over the domestic equidae marmelade (from real fruit, not those vegetables that are now sold, their contents are not even present) and ask me about the dried beans we have gathered with my mother so gladly.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room when we played songs from the radio to the tapes that were played aloud in the old tape recorder after my mother.
And then we turned on the tapes and walked up to the same song, our favorite one, and we got caught up in the symphony.
Or we phoned over the table using the backphones that were connected to us by the operation - and when we were already on the phone, to hear better, it was necessary to clean up our ears basically, that was a squeezer.
The minimum probably was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live with it so that we didn't have anything to do with it.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPadys even cell phones and notebooks or brand-new clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "adjustment" into the store was hitchhiked by domestic products using SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the mother's notebook mentioned and at least so Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used at the same time in the train on a school trip.
We've come to play more interestingly with Aunt Cloboučka Hop or Man, no matter how I've already taken "just" out.
When I was a little older we got under a video player tree, his parents must have been looking at him for a long time, but he didn't play with us for a long time.
My younger sister threw a bullet into him, while he was so pretty that he burned the papers, so she tried if he was a priest and a thief.
I'm sorry he fell asleep, but it was his last kiss.
Well, this opportunity is up to today, poor, on your dad's plate.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she was screaming at the video and she thought she was playing the recipe and didn't win it, so she can't play it today.
I remember how we were able to communicate with everyone, chat without a cell phone, computer.
Together with my sister, we had a conversation at the Grandmother's holidays with her uncle when we met again next year at Grandma's - and it was, so it was.
We've met.
Now make a promise to someone to see you in a year?!
I also remember in the winter when we, along with the whole village, ran out, put snowflakes on the roof of the church on the mud walls.
Then we spent an evening with the whole family and talked about the busy day.
Of course, we listened to our sister every evening, notoriously, to the well-known saying, "Don't touch your hands!"
Yes, it's paid today, but you probably don't have a co-infection brought into the net by lemons.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" in a beer with Jardou from the village, we slept with Mom on the floor, washed her feet on a rock, opened her door and looked at the flames and listened to the cracking of a tree with a stone line.
We were close - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social networks, we knew how many friends we had!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like this, but we knew more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by watching the album where the black holes are carefully decorated with black photos.
And if I don't know how much I was then, the back of the photo is always written in the year of the motion picture.
I see that if our sisters didn't listen very much to us, and we also had a brother-in-law with two bigger numbers, no one ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (no IN).
And I'd rather go back to reality about that step.
By 2013 and I'll wait to see what modern times will mean for my children once.
What I do know is that these memories of me are now for a young generation growing up so at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the ops" and I think they're going to come up with a lot of things that's not going to happen to this "precipitate" age.
I'd love to!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies complained about the patents of Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of patents missing from Nortel’s company, filed on Thursday a patent application against manufacturers of mobile phones, including Google’s company, which exceeded the price of Nortel’s banknote.
The Rockstar Consortium, which won Nortel's USD 4.5 billion patents, appealed to the U.S. management court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other patent infringement companies.
The Rockstar company is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
The patents include technologies that help to link the expressions sought online with the relevant advertising, which is the core of Google’s search company.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar did not immediately arrive.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work on Google Android operating system, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google made for the patents of Nortel companies emerging a price of $900 million.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel’s patents were won by Rockstar, Google won $12.5 billion by Motorola Mobility, which was a business motivated by a partly group of Motorola’s patents.
"Despite the failure of the attempt to obtain patents that were subject to the dispute, Google patents have been corrupted and continues to deteriorate," the complaint states.
The company Rockstar seeks to increase its compensation for the damage caused by Google because it considers it to be a breach of Google's patent objectively, as the claim claims.
Miloslava Cépkova: List of smiles
She came out of four degrees of Celsia, and we're not used to them yet.
First, she gave up smiles, one that kept on going as a defense against a friendly environment.
This made her very angry because it was a mask she decided not to expose to the public.
He was honest at home only in the days when Grandma was dating and she had Elin or Adík around her.
And of course, when her sons called her.
She was very good at learning from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they're finally really walking.
Don't make fun of her closest.
Then he flew into the kitchen.
It's like a man-to-man trap.
In November, not even another month, she can't do that miracle so she can really smile like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt shall refer to the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursi has made an inaugural vow, but his triumphal day is only hard to end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised "new Egypt", when he was celebrated as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husný Mubarak, who was held 16 months ago.
At its introduction to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murzy also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth head of the Egyptian state since the collapse of monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges delivered to the blacksmiths in a chair built with a look at the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are working on a better morning, a new Egypt and another republic," Murzy said at a public television service.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who had been largely 84 years of its origin as an illegal organization and a serious attack on individual governments.
When Murzy arrived in a small car colony shortly after 11 o'clock in the morning, hundreds of soldiers and police were stationed.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the building court to celebrate the President, and the delivery was only short-term in order to enable the colony to design a common red road between the city centre and the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Murzy, which was subsequently marked as a non-characteristic "reservative pneumatic" of the Muslim brotherhood, grew early from his victory and his fifth appearance, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate for Islam, but also to all those who want to bring an end to opposition to the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Murzy said in a fashionable social dress with a red tie of judges in a wooden room where he made an oath.
Murzy later went to the Kahari University where he was supposed to present inaugural evidence.
While he was being watched, he received official compliments from a military captain who played national hymns.
He was a military leader, full of Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was carried out by the scandal of “armies and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the principal lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a village of Islamic students.
Murzy made a symbolic contribution to the village of Tahrír in the fifth place where the revolution ended by the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and celebratedly promised that he would regain the presidential power of his office to the military council that he had taken from the excommunicated leader.
But I agree with the conclusion of an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament as usual, that the will of the army has been challenged, which means that the struggle will continue.
The dramatic demonstration at Tahrír's village was full of dramatic populist gestures.
They'll probably be police specialists. They'll have to calm down.
In the gates in the Czech Republic, police specialists should act in the future.
They'd be here until half of their visits.
They'd look at the order and solve the problems.
Because of their knowledge, they should contribute to reducing tension between people from poor places and the people around them.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry shall count on it.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would mainly help "the rapid social security of the country".
The document was issued by the government.
According to the analysis, some 300 poor homes and a quarter were in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
They lived in 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in getets were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a lighthouse.
According to the experts on problem locations, there has been a percentage difference.
The relationships between their citizens and others are strained.
In a few places there have been anti-terrorist movements.
The extremists were joined by people from around the world.
According to the interior, the police are obliged to maintain order in areas of safety and order.
The basic condition is that "continuous application of equal access to the exclusion of law".
But it is not possible to achieve this without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would go to a meeting in a ghetto where he would spend up to half of his services, serve the rest of his crew.
In the problem area, he'd look at the order.
He would also know local, so he could solve better problems or offenses.
"With these trusts, specialists will be able to carry out a whole range of counter-terrorism," said the interior.
Specialists in the ghettos would get benefits, which is between 500 and 1000 koruna a month.
The introduction of special police officers into the problem areas should be financed from the Norwegian funds.
The figure is approximately 600,000 euros (now worth 15.5 million koruna).
Czech pays 15 per cent of the sum, funds 85 per cent.
The preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is being drawn up.
The project will last until 2016.
The authorities were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovenia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is unlikely to be higher than in the PRC.
"There are so-called Roman states here," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not clear yet.
The answer has to be given by an analysis which specifies where a special police officer needs to be.
It will also depend on how much money will be released by the police after the end of the project every year.
According to the project's proposal, the police are first chosen to take a stand in Slovenia.
Five tenths of staff should attend this training each year.
They'll get the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will be in trouble.
According to the authors, improving the situation would help mainly social housing.
It should prompt and lead to integration.
According to the inside presentation, there should be three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by accommodation with precise rules such as the number of persons per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards would have social housing which would be comparable to normal housing.
Renters would have to complete an integration plan that would consist of social workers.
They should keep the housing order, take care of their health, send the children to school, rehabilitate and actively look for work.
If they tried to get started, they would enter a higher standard of living.
The system of walk-in housing should operate within at least 30 years until another generation "in an integrally motivated environment" is grown.
The social housing model prepares resources for local development and work.
They're planning it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Oil top - one of our youngest soups.
The oil peak is an ideal peak of 3 km south of Bruntal.
Along with a number of others, the evidence of joint activities in the Netherlands is recent (from a geologic perspective).
The last eruptions here were still in the beginning of the fourth.
In view of the greater distance, there is a striking white white on the top of the Uhlary Mountains overlooking the Baroque Basin Church of Ms. Marie Auxiliary, set in 1755 - 1765.
He won the original wooden wooden wooden platoon.
The guest who stood next to the church didn't keep quiet.
Shortly after the end of the church, an ale was excavated from four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the UHL is already a third version, the original site has been standing since 1916, the second from 2001 to 2004.
On the fifteenth stops there are wooden plastics made by the local artist Francis Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the low Jeseník area.
Similarly, the principles of Hornin from the inner sphere create an interesting geologic exhibition.
The name of the sponsor is also given on each stop.
The coal top is the rest of the young soybean.
Although data from radiometric measurements are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
So he is younger than the Great Red (old 3.3 million years) and older than the Venusina soup (old 0.8 million years).
The file was created by an explosion.
It drew a large number of side effects together with hornin pellets from the base that produced a reddened color by burning.
At the end of this phase, it ran out on the surface of the lion - today it is a kind of twisted chain up to 13 meters strong.
The second outbreaks fired red, yellow and places up to black tubes.
Their species are strong up to 50 meters and its part is available in the wall of the hole.
In the tubs there are ideal side seeds of up to 1 metre. And the second rupture was completed by the opening of the blade.
At the end of the activity, the lion has disappeared from its nest, which today creates up to 50 m of a strong kind of hardwood.
The most common species of soybeans are the species of soybean.
Because they're actually composed of species, they got the name stratovolcane.
The original anti-emergency skin gradually deteriorated.
However, he was threatened by a heavy horn in the south.
The most intense hardship was experienced here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tufus were added to concrete, which was then easier and had better heat insulation properties.
The training was carried out under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and to maintain this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the flexibility and low-consistency of the horn, which quickly air, break down and fall down.
Lom is going so fast.
To make the situation even more complex, it is warm, south-eastly oriented with its ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The adjustment is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geologic profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles remain on a number of important sites.
At the Uhlírský summit you will be awarded a green tourist ticket from Bruntál, where possible from the Slezsk Kočov.
Automobiles can use free parking at the beginning of the lip-allia, where a short course of learning begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a Chinese villa with a garden and a pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Oréchovce.
The original owners of the house still got it back in the restaurant and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
Ivana therefore quickly searched for a place to live for herself and her older mother.
From the famous she got a guy on the apartment 3 + kk in the old panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor on a vast forest park and the reward went over me on the other side," Ivana recalls in his first opinion.
First I said it'd be a three-year period.
"We live here today for more than thirty years and not only because of progressive reconstruction," adds the owner.
Mother and daughter then moved from one hundredth of an apartment to less than 62 m2 and all the equipment was divided.
The action was not simple, things were coordinated with a friend and the progressive arrangement lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in a good condition, but they had to undergo necessary repairs, such as opening the door or changing the window.
The former owner chose a core, but the owner most disliked the most unprofessional solution and quite a big one, and rather a small bathroom.
A combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living room.
The architects used to limit the individual areas and members of the sacrokarton room, which allowed the new location of the lamp.
The first stroke she had to face after a few years was the removal of the story into the living room.
The apartment has been changed to 2 + KK, but the room has been air-conditioned and a panoramic view of the green environment has been opened.
The next step towards partial improvement of the standard was the refund of VAT for laminate.
Ivan didn't know the advice with the bathroom.
I've been collecting housing magazines for years and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting fulfillment.
So, on the recommendation, I praised the young architect of Kamil Douder.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
The refurbishment of the bathroom also led to repair and availability of the premier.
The architect connected the WC space and the bathroom and two doors with open wings were replaced by one of the buildings that saved the place.
The bathroom is over-time and also quite un-barrier.
The quality sheets imitate the sandbag, in the shower is also a comfortable seat, in the closet of the bead.
A successful collaboration with Kamilo Doudér continued.
As part of the order, the dream was passed quickly, but the fundamental change of the living room was shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
To the space that created a connection between two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, food, housing and space without helping with the classic principles of optical sharing, such as semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would damage the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It was originally possible to separate the spaces and the living part.
It's enough to turn behind two screws and put between them a piece of paper made of paper.
The food bags limit the distances of flooring and outlet.
On the basis of the kitchen and the dining room, the architect used quality marmouleum, the two doors where the wallpaper was revived.
The kitchen stove shall, if necessary, cover the adjacent panels with wallpaper.
A new base from anti-allergic marble has a range of benefits from previous laminate: soft non-clustic surface without sleep and better sound insulation.
The dispersion and under-view system of the color-exposed sucrose is an indication of how you can work with your space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects. I was hoping it would be happy.
"I like orange, the same ratio I had in the past," says Ivan.
The surface of the graphoscal with a motif of fine magnesium is practical and creates an excellent aesthetic ingredient.
To a warm energy tone, architects chose a white, which was underpinned by modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was decided to place books apart from others and to the space under the umbrella.
Everything's on the docks, lamps are comfortablely controlled away.
In the transformation interior, the contrast of a new elder, for example with a ten-year-old Christian masterpiece, and with the quality art items that Ivana collects all his life.
Last time the kitchen came.
The curtains were previously placed on both sides, and the owner seemed a little like a tunnel.
The architect picked up their number and crossed the space.
The apartment in the simple design is made on the ban, the white area gently absorbs the spring surface.
They went to the small space thanks to the ideal solution of the mill, dryer, and mill.
Because of the small kitchen, he restored the entire wall surface on the desktop.
The unique graphics school with digitally sealed motive is attractive, and it is well maintained.
Ivana has chosen the flowers of the Magnolia that remind her of the favorite fourth in which she has lived for years.
Now it looks like she's safe here.
In the original bathroom there was a small van and a trailer, the new owner chose the neutral proportion of the board.
A big shower bag has a locked door, Ronal.
The purpose was to create a clear simple space from the environment in which functions and equipment would be in harmony.
We've assembled the interior materialally and colourally and tried to find out about his elegant, delicate, not too full of views.
"An additional condition of task was a non-barrier solution with a minimum barrier and the possibility of easy movement around the supply and the achievement of daily needs," adds Kamila Doudér.
The Supreme Court has decided: There is no time to stop.
The Supreme Court has decided that former Prime Minister Petra Nejas may also be affected by any criminal acts that may have been allowed before the Serbian settlement of the Senate.
She only protected him from procedural immunity, which relates to manifestations in Snow.
In the case of former MEPs, ODS Ivana Fuxy, Mark Schnajdra and Petra Tluchore, however, decided that he could not be held responsible for any criminal acts of the period before the Lonns committed a parliamentary mandate in November, said Judge Petr Knötig of the Supreme Court.
By this decision, the Court rejected the proposal by the State representative Ivan Ištvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the Ambassador.
According to him, they have made payments in the form of lucrative positions in state companies because they give up their mandate and will not make any problems with the adoption of laws.
On the other hand, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can continue.
With Vit Bartou, the officer of the anti-corruption police has also been detained
Bart's spokesman, Mr. Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented her in the cause of the data corruption of the VV Members, also did not want to say too much, but he said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but in view of the protection of the underlying facts I cannot comment on."
According to information The case is resolved by the General Security Inspection of the Security Councils (GIBS).
Server Tn.cz reported that Barta could buy information from the police.
According to the server first-hand.cz, the case could have been related to the case of former police president Petra Lessy, whose appointment to Barta's function was likely to take place.
The latest information of the Law, however, shows that the detention of Vita Barty with Petre Lessy does not depend on it.
The speaker of the police president Eva Kropačo refused to comment on the fact that in the case there is a Persian city representative.
"We will not comment on this question in the light of the protection of the hidden facts," Mr. Zenklov said on Friday's City Council of State Affairs in Prague.
Right there, the complainant takes note of Bart's case, and his words do not directly indicate that the record or criminal proceedings are conducted in the arrest order.
The reporters were able to welcome the wife of Viita Barty Katerín in front of their apartment in Prague.
She just put the suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to express herself to the whole event.
On Friday morning, the President of the St. Tomio Okamura was released to Bart's detention.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's in the case.
"The victory Barta was one of many candidates from many parties to our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the World's direct democracy, Tomio Okamura," he added.
The victory of Barta, who in his earlier elections to Snow in the Plenary country failed to succeed in moving to raise direct democracy Tomio Okamura, is known for its corrupt cause of paying tribute to Members of the Major Public.
In April 2012, he was wrongly sentenced to 18 months with 30 months in prison.
Later, the judgment was changed and Barta was forgiven.
I want a contract in NHL.
I'm still in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love and I'm in love.
She was always in the family's first place for Nepal, so she wants to be fully subject to it in her 38 years.
Whether he gets a job in the summer or he's still going on his career or he's definitely finished with hockey.
"I want to play the role of fathers and husbands."
"I'm so happy about it," says a hockeyist who's still waiting for the offer.
Even though he's a well-known employee who never leaves.
Despite the fact that every person on the ice leaves his heart and is able to play with it.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus's season in the past season.
"But it's a pleasure to show it to everyone in me all the time," he exclaimed resolutely.
Maybe he's waiting, probably he's in New York Rangers, where he hasn't been invited into the season and there's two wounded opponents - the attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How does it look when you come to Rangers?
They're just speculation.
Unless I have something on paper, it's not worth it.
I know he sent an article in New York Post to sign me, but that's all.
It was never added that it really happened.
I'm sorry, I'd like to know I have a contract, but it's just not.
They didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's about to get into a situation when this contract really comes.
When a player needs to get hurt or it doesn't go to someone and it doesn't go away.
There are a number of different factors that need to meet together in order for me to get this contract.
But similar circumstances are happening in New York, right?
He was hurt by Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team didn't go into the season, so there's a certain chance there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
The other thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got anything yet.
That's how I regret the reality I have to live in.
On Friday you're going to America, you're expecting something else could just stick around?
I've been expecting this since 5 July when the NHL opened the market with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
Of course not. I'm going to Tampy for kids and for my wife.
I'm glad to see you on the sun and when we see you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband and everything's going to go away.
I'm not a hockeyist right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna play my dad's and my husband's role, and I'm so happy about that.
It's my whole family's Christmas to be able to support our children in what they want to do on Sunday.
Do you think you could do this on your passports for full benefit?
Of course, a person can think about a lot of things.
And this can happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 tours because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot and a lot to do.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the pride, winning and gambling won't reward you for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let you have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could do with my family except for my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hoceist, it's the first place - except for families - it's also a sport success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so I'm sorry, our children -- my wife and I -- grew up in the States, started going to school, and so on.
And we would be very pleased if we continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to say is that in America there's a way out of here somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America forever?
We're gonna practice it like this.
That means we'll be in the summer in the Czech Republic on the Deep and around the Czech Budějovic.
And in the winter, back in Tampey or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfectly ideal to be in the heat.
I had great luck in my life.
I'll tell you that I went against him, it's got a lot of strength and excitement, and it took me a lot of things I've missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options and this is one of them.
That we can choose where we will live with our wife.
There are many people in the world who are hungering for this so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will it take you to love your third, hard training and wait for the offer?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
Today, I still have it in me, this cup of tea, this wanton, it's inspiration, it's passion for this sport, it's exciting and motivated to prove to people that you're still on NHL that I'm always better than anybody else.
But I can't tell how long it'll stay there.
It's not gonna be planned.
So you can say you're waiting for this season to come up and then decide what's next?
I'm in phase when I'm coming from day to day.
Recently, the Director-General of ČEZ announced that the decision on construction 3 and 4 blocks of the Temelín electricity will expire at the end of 2014 or 2015.
This was justified by waiting for a new State energy concept and by agreeing with the Government's Treaties of Difference.
For these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - thus for the majority of shareholders.
A qualified manager should, however, give recommendations to shareholders and not hide for him.
Grandma: I'm just with Sobotka.
Andrej Babish is starting to calm down that his desire for the UN will not have time to learn a political order in opposition and that it will have to be equal to the government in order to bring about something.
The President of the United Nations agreed to do so in the debate on the Law tomorrow.
Trade and marketing SchkoFIN leader Abrahamámek
Its competence includes the area of product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with trade partners.
As a result, he was rewarded by a man named Chantor.
Abraham of the last 14 years of his career has been connected to the car industry.
He moved to Toyota Motor Czech, then to Fiat ČR company, where he was responsible for the sign and dealership of Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last move was the company Suzuki Motor Czech, where over five years he held the position of the car division manager.
SchkoFIN was born in 1992.
The police evacuated part of the airport in Los Angeles.
The international airport in Los Angeles was shot in the morning.
As a result, the police evacuated part of the airport, possibly three terminals.
The Reuters Agency, referring to the California media, claims that the men of law shot a gun at an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to the police, reported that two to three security officers were attacked by the shooter.
How many people were completely injured and whether they were victims, but it's still not obvious.
The Hasichis are talking about events with a larger number of people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The goal was to be Russian rockets for Hezballah.
Israeli military aircraft on Thursday apparently bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
With a call from the US government, CNN announced it.
Israel’s explosive press in the database reported a wide range of reports, but the Israeli government did not confirm it.
The Israeli army spoke on CNN's question refused to comment on the incident.
"We're not going to report foreign media," she said.
The Israeli invasion meant that according to the U.S. government source of rockets and related equipment, which, according to the Israelis, could be transferred to the Lebanese army of Hizballah.
The AP Agency, referring to another US security agent, reported that Russian SA-125 rockets were intended for the purpose of the Israeli invasion in the Syrian territory.
The second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was probably a highly modern Syrian anti-aircraft system.
Satellite photos of the area of the attack but according to DPA agency showed the battery of Russian rocket type S-125 New.
In addition, they had seen the SA-3 missile battery including the leading centre with the radar to track the rockets and their targets.
According to Israeli television reports, the recorded rockets are 35 miles [35 km] below and could carry heads of 70 kilograms.
At least twice this year Israel reportedly bombed the supply of rockets inside Syria, CNN and AP indicated.
The Israeli army had never responded to such reports, repeatedly but declared that it would attack any supply of weapons designated by Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
A significant internet end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successful in achieving this trend.
The company has updated the annual profit estimate and is expected to record profits from the Australian and Great Britain.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic income before tax to move between 325 and 340 million USD around 305 to 315 million from previous projections.
If current development is maintained, this will represent a twelve to seven-percent increase towards the recorded profit of US$ 290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre has created eight percent profit in the first half and the second half of the second half has begun to grow rapidly, especially in the Australian and British travel outside the service road.
"To date, our 10 countries are benefiting, and several of them are leading to a record annual benefit before the rating and taxation," he said.
It belongs to Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest forms of profit.
During the second half of Australia’s recreational activities, it has grown to compensate for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain the Flight Centre has led well into the recreational area, while business customers have lost less.
The United States has been hit by a fall in the last half of the season and is expected to bring a quarter of the year's profit.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at USD 38.20 level.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to Petrohrad
The ecologically active detention since September in Russia due to the protest against planned robbery in Arctic has been transferred from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
She informed the AFP agency today with a call to the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original charge of its pirate activists has not yet been lodged.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that three thirds of men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil spill in the Arctic have been transferred from the correctional facility in Murmanska to the Petrohrad prison," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for moving detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, there was a planned move.
Environmental authorities were first accused of piracy, which threatened them for up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, it was announced that this charge would be rewarded with a more peaceful settlement, with a lower punishment with the upper limit of seven years of freedom.
But Greenpeace, in today's statement, warned that the charges of piracy had not yet been dropped as promised.
This means that detentions are now charged with two criminal acts.
The High Committee for Investigation last week announced that the Pirate Bay charge would be compensated for by an excretion charge.
However, when three-thirds of the prisoners stood before the committee this week, the Pirate Bay charges were not filed.
Instead, a new charge was raised against everyone," AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
The Russians held in the Gazprom's red zone, in half, three tenths of Greenpeace's crew members from 18 countries.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship that sank under the ground.
Since then, all of them have been in a relationship against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Under conditions of imprisonment, environmental concerns arise.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naiddo, according to AFP today, indicated that the move to Petrohrad was a simple meeting with families and consular workers.
However, there are no guarantees that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
The Dutch King Willema-Alexandra asked for help from one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a written letter published today by General Dagblad, Monarch invited him to discuss their situation at a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Mali has a large share in the reconstruction of sectoral violence in Iraq, which is also part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, regulation and grammar
In the hours of English literature, at least one Shakespeare game will have to be studied, a novel from the 19th century, a romantic poem and a contemporary British bet since 1914.
The test will also include "secret text" in order to motivate deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and languages will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a master language test and will be asked to choose English literature as a voluntary subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new basis for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first items to undergo radical change.
The next year will be the following year's change in other key items.
In a separate step, the Offqual office, which is responsible for maturitis tests, will detect changes in the maturitis test structure, along with a new system of labelling and less content of projects for students.
In his speech last summer, Minister of School Michael Gove said that he is in favour of "a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our test system in order to regain confidence in society", and that it should be necessary to make the matrimonial trial "more difficult, more ambitious and more urgent".
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics — 116 hours a year or three hours a week — than most other countries.
To compare schools in Australia, mathematics is average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that it contains a mathematical test – together with a greater focus on this subject in the resulting Hebrew language – is likely to motivate schools to provide further education.
The training plan will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
Ostravašký primator Kanar: Rakovinu in ČSSD I am not
Before the elections, a long-distance dispute between the two horses fighting the effects of the ČSSD has been completely heated.
It was all because of the non-democratic formation of candidates by the Prime Minister of Ostravy Peter Kaynar.
The causes, however, did not want to make too much expression so that they would not hurt the side before the elections.
But now the voices of the voters are read.
The administration of the ČSSD so soon on Monday evening invited Ostravy's host to come out from the side, and it will obviously press for his role.
But Peter wants to go on fighting.
What's going on in the tracks and who's on whose side he's on, he's described in an exclusive conversation for the Danik.
How do you note the result of love?
ČSSD must have calculated a lot better result.
Did she hurt us because they solved the media disputes in front of the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the situation in which ČSSD is now.
It's a side that has its internal problems, it's sick inside, and people realize it's not all right.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are those internal problems of the ČSSD?
In the fall, I think the ODS is going through some time and similar things are now being played in social democracy.
It's so that lobbyists, influential people who once expected to find their gangs at ODS, moved to the people in ČSSD and influenced them.
It's about the fact that after the offices of the Ostrava Master, the police are going to pick up the computer.
It shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who want good for all others, but many of them think especially of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two incorrigible camps and in Prague, as seen in the current struggle between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a reflection of what's going on in Prague.
The Haškov wing gradually contained positions so that after the elections, it could trigger a situation that weakens Sobotk’s wing.
Man is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to get to compromise.
But everyone has some internal borders when these compromises are no longer going, and that's my case.
At first I didn't want to run into the show, but when I noticed this whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaoralk that I was trying to get to the national candidate so that I could send Sobotk's wing right as Ostravy's prime minister.
Hashko's wings are on it, but it's got a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotky, not Michal Haška?
The celebration of Sobotka is in my opinion a person who always talks mainly about the ČSSD programme and to certain extent and about visions for the party and for this country.
I admit I didn't hear anything like this on the other side.
Michal Hashek's just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only start calling the Chair of the Party.
It's a fight for power regardless of everything, and I'm against being on the side.
According to me, what Michal Hashek has now done in Prague has ended his political career.
As you were aware, you were not accepted by the ČSSD for a candidate.
The political parties are based on competition as their members.
This competition should be based on most of the programme visas and on the ability of those people to fill those visas.
Of course, there are also people who do not have the ability or vision to compete, but the political side is for them a challenge to money that they would not otherwise have.
The problem is when these people start getting ahead of themselves because they break the rules without accompaniment, they break the laws of the parties.
They're doing their practice on the political side of the mafia and I think they're breaking the laws of the Czech Republic.
To warn of this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kaynar has any political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the views.
Is that why you have put before the elections a proposal for a court-martial action against the likes of the ČSSD candidate in Morravskosleszki country?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava ensures its strength that organisations which do not comply with it can be abolished, effectively establishing a new organisation, gradually expelling members of non-conformity.
For example, it may be that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednerík from the club of the representatives, but he filed a complaint against it and then they gave up his resignation.
This indicates that it is the only option when the other methods and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function.
The power to conduct the ČSSD in front of Ambassador Adam Rykalow is to call you from the position of prime minister.
It's a public secret that this post has an old-fashioned Prouby Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykal and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get rid of me.
They promise people positions, get votes, and then they guarantee their power in the side.
When I got back to the past, everything I had to play around the football club of Baník Ostrava and buying the Basal Stadium was just a trap for them to be able to stick to me.
It was highly respected so that they could mark me as a person who gives money where it doesn't belong.
In the near city, he bought a property that has a strategic value for him.
So how do you see it going on with your work as a recipient?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and others on Monday to consider their service in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when the thief calls out, "Get the thief!
As we look at the results of my work over the past 11 years, I can't see anyone in the Austrian social democracy who would start and pass, sometimes even against the members of the parties, the causes of so many development things such as the need for industrial areas or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
I'm not comfortable with everything.
I don't read it any other way than I'm going to stop the others from going to the places they're worried about.
Are you going to try something else against this?
Because if this Republic has a good functioning, then it must also be a good political party.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to manage effectively if he cannot control himself.
So I don't think I'd leave ČSSD now because I think that the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to test me.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of the public club
The organizer of the olymous Christmas markets and winter brewing Paul Spalený stated that preparatory work at the club was started on 26 October, and from the middle of the process is to be aggregated for the production of ice.
The ice type is already seven centimetres long and the surface will be ready for the first visitors on Friday morning.
The castle has a area of 375 square meters, and the basement has an area of 358 square meters.
Bruslars and the next will also have two seats with a puncture.
"We have expanded the ground floor, increased the space before the walls, and almost the entire floor of the floor is closed so that the brushers can pass smoothly," said the Burnen.
The streets of Olomouce are already reminiscent of Christmas.
Loni was a club because of the construction of the Lower House directly before the main entrance of the office in the Upper House.
The downside repair was completed at the end of the year, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
At first, people were able to break up right before the workshop in 2009, when there was a club in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became a weekly part of the city's Christmas market.
The evening markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will begin in the mountain resort months before the Saturday.

The brutal murder of the senior officer in Zlinsk will be re-solved by the national court
The national court dismissed the complaint of 50-year-old Slovak and 20-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the wine.
They've been threatened with 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or extraordinarily fine.
The speaker, Peter Angyalossy, confirmed that the Supreme Court had rejected the country's decision and had returned his case to trial.
The reasons given by the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been handed down by the parties.
Unfortunately, the young men had spent 17 years of their lives in his home.
The senior died of three-year-old death.
According to her husband’s complaint, she was raped and buried all over her body and also a metal object, apparently a gas gun, set about three tenths of the morning in her head.
A man suffered serious injury, such as a fracture of his bone, an island of the brain or a bleeding into the brain that he was exposed to.
Young people have reportedly brought some 3,000 crowns and spices to about 14,000 crowns.
According to the national court, they were the only direct evidence against the appellant's peaceful step which the scholar considered to be not fully found within the meaning of the legal instructions.
In more than ten cases, the peace steps from the place of action and other things were in line with the complaints, however, the police initially adopted them as permanent rather than peaceful steps.
In addition, certain errors were detected when they were controlled.
According to the Senate, there was no evidence of any guilt.
However, the court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he was obviously fallen and injured himself.
She did not even notice the violent death of a medical doctor.
Criminals were contacted by a few days later by drug dealers who had revealed signs of violent death.
The police were no longer able to work with all the steps from the place where the guards were calming down.
There's no DNA on the spot that's been found.
Young Slovák lived in Uherskohradísk.
Now he's been sentenced to 8.5 years, which Loney has confirmed by a law-enforcement Supreme Court.
According to him, the man was the head of a group of six young men who had a tragic overcrowding of gold.
Loupages took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior officer in Slopne.
Young people charged with the murder of seniors live in the Uhersk Kradista.
In August, he was released by the court after 11 months.

At the beginning of November, the new football stadium will be rebuilt.
On Thursday, the stadium was surrounded by buildings that were to be reconstructed.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znomá is divided into four stages in order to establish standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week Subway
The Saxophone great and legend of Wayne Shorter's drawings makes the next midpoint in the 18th anniversary of the Struny Festival of the South.
The shorter will appear on November 6th in Lucerny's Grand Hall together with his quarter in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
On the second half of the evening, the Shorter is accompanied by a spontaneous iron improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonic under the direction of Martin Kumžáka.
In Shorter's corrections for a Symphony Orchestra, Pegasus's collection from the news album Without A Net, as well as his older stocks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although this year celebrated the 80th birthday in July, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the Stronas in the south is starting his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
A number of the performers he worked with, from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell and Carlos Santana.
He also met with Czech singer Miroslav Vitoše and visual relative Joe Zawinul, who, in the legendary Weather Report after more than a decade, gave direction to a new fashion merger.
He's been dating Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last thirty years.
Jakousi after the festival will be another club night Spotlight, which will be held on 9 November at the Roxy/NoD club.
According to charismatic singer Andrey Triany, a manchester trio Go Penguin presents to the Turkish audience with its jazzed electronic and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which brings with it an electro-smoker formation of Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The Court of Justice shall order UEFA to publish penalties for the decision-makers.
Dagmar Damk, Chairman of the Committee of the Chosen People's Football Association of the PRC, has ceased to publish sentences for the Court.
She is prohibited by the UEFA rules, which led to a discussion on the Day of Law.
In the wrong case, the FACHR would have threatened the situation.
The Damko also refused to turn the photoballists away from where they came from.
These speculations are really ridiculous.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the Commission are separated, for example from Prague.
So in the event of vote I can lose 1:6," Damk said in response to the criticism that developed after the Plyzen played twice as many pentals as other medical teams.
Although, in recent months, FAČR has ceased to publish sentences for decision-making, Damkov ensures that the judges are sorry for their mistakes.
"Believe me that if the Commission finds out that the decision has made a mistake, it will limit its delegation, whatever it may be," Damk said.
For reasons why the penalties are not published, it is in accordance with the Danish law of the European Union.
"The EAFRD prohibits the publication of such information and the violation of the strict penalty."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I got two very serious warnings that if we don't stop this, severe sanctions will come," said Damk.
The other countries respect the ban.
"We were really exceptions," she added.
If information were to continue to be published, the Commission could come up with the money from UEFA on training and development of decision-making.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them we could not complete a programme for the training of decision-makers," added Damk.
Barty's detention is related to Janoušk and Beam: Are they behind the crew?
The President of the Great Public Vita Barta closed the police on Thursday.
He was also arrested by Jan Petržílek, the leader of the Anti-Corruption Police Committee.
The detention relates to the follow-up of lobbyist Roman Janouška and former prime minister Paul Béma (ODS).
The information about the delegates from the News.cz server confirmed that the Czech press office is a reliable source.
Listened telephone calls Janouška and Béma, which in March published the Young Front Day of Today and in which both men use "Mazánk" and "Kolibrík", show the impact of Janousk on the city's steps under Bémo's leadership.
The daily reported that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS) was organized, since two years later it was transferred to the ABL Security Agency.
That's where Bart was.
Server Novinky.cz warned that a detained criminal Petržilek was working before his approach to the anti-corruption police right for BIS.
To the anti-corruption firm that was subsequently killed, Petržilek passed at the same time as it was published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything," complainant Michal Muravsky of the City State of Prague said.
He refused to confirm that the case was under surveillance.
The case does not want to comment on the same reason or inspection.
Six companies from ten are preparing for a new civil law
In the near future, the effectiveness of the new Civil Law and the Law on Commercial Corporations from 1 January 2014 will be intensively prepared by six companies from ten.
Only eight per cent of the company's questioned representatives indicated that the issues related to both key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
This is the result of a study by the law office Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which found out the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the near future, both key codes are currently being identified by a number of managers, which can have a significant impact on their company's business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years are still affecting all citizens and companies in the PRC.
As a result of policy lobbying, the business sector lived long in uncertainty as to whether or not the end of the revolution will come.
"But it is only a few weeks left for them to pass through the new law for their companies without complication," commented the results of partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil.
Of 61 per cent of the companies actively involved in the new legislation, 26 per cent indicated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
More than 35 per cent of these companies are inclined to take the necessary measures as soon as possible.
On the contrary, every five companies have not yet had their recodifications, although they have a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
At least 11 per cent have no opinion and the problem cannot be resolved.
Only eight per cent of companies recognise that the issues related to recodification have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil law is the largest number of companies concerned with the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), followed by the solution of commercial conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the accident of property and liability for damage (by 10 per cent).
The contract reflects one of the most significant newspapers of the whole recodification, which is a combination of the revision of the contract only within the framework of the new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting in more transparency of contractual law for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, a new reform will offer a lot of newspapers focusing on greater freedom of relationship management," warned counsel Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukaš Podnany.
With regard to the Law on Trade Corporations, almost a quarter of the company's problem of increasing the liability of the statutory authorities is considered the most important issue.
The following are topics relating to changes in the reference and duration of the wave collection (15 per cent) and company representation (14 per cent).
A new legal adjustment means clarifying the obligations and possible consequences for the statutory authorities, in particular in situations where the company is threatened or affected.
"In practice, this means that if members and managers do not deal with the care of the right economy and do not respond to the threat of company failure, they can benefit from the benefits of the operation until the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Carter's style as a living language
My task is to keep tradition and at the same time to put our mark on the modern thing so that it doesn't remain an enchanted relic, explains in the discussion for HN Pierre Rainero, director of style in Cartier company.

Travels through the bay, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Belle is providing free medical care at the universities in Cameroon.
Belle and his team will heal almost every week hundreds of patients.
In West Africa there are not too many doctors; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
You can vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Balle is one of the 10 main candidates at the CNN Award in Hrdin in 2013.
You can vote for CNN Hrdin in 2013 or for any other of the 10 main candidates.
He's gonna get $250,000 so he can go on in his extraordinary job.
For the past 21 years, Georges Belle has been following his father, how he again falls unconscious and goes to a hospital that was not equipped to help him.
In 1981, James Balle was injured in a car accident near the main city of Cameroon Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with his own broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, and there he developed a hematom that caused him problems for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Walle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had money for it.
Instead, Belle spent years transporting his father to a crowded clinic and hospital where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Belle.
You can leave home at 5:00 in the morning, run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Balley's father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 citizens.
Only for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 citizens.
And even if doctors were able to visit Cameroonians, many could not afford to.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Belle.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Walle saw her father and many of her fellow countrymen suffer, she decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Belle and his volunteer team performed the last year of free 700 operations.
I became a medical surgeon at the center hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose weekend members visit outside areas where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been helping their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday he and as many as 30 people are speeding up to the supply, which is suitable for medical needs and travel through the narrow terrain to the villages that need help.
It's not always good luck.
There's no need to push the vehicle through the river and the bay.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as real heroes: the host, the song and dance and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these neighborhoods, medical care is indeed a free reason to celebrate and Belle, with its wide smile and energy, is very willing to join the local party.
The next day the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients for every treatment," says Bwell.
They're coming to the village 60 kilometers away, and it's sand.
During each of these weeks doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes, parasitic diseases and mostly transmitted diseases.
Other can be obtained with beryl or gifted glasses or a free family list – a document that requires school, but which is simply not allowed by many loved ones.
Tonight, the team is doing simple operations under local drugs.
Operations usually take place in construction schools, at the workshop or at home; after surgery the patient rises up and goes to the place of storage to relax the place for another patient.
With light from the generator, operating rooms and the health equipment of Belle and its volunteers work in the early hours of the morning.
It's boring, but local musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay up and go on at work, they're playing on drums all night," says Walle.
He's going back to town on Sunday, tired but proud of his job.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and is aware that their help can mean a lot to local people.
One man said that after surgery the kiln would be able to work again.
"It's our family's changing the future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekly clinics and surgery in Belle hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second job is financed by approximately 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he actually sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and working as a volunteer for the Belle group.
They're always in the hospital or they're trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and medical students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Belle in his mission, it's a great practice that they wouldn't get home.
"Dr. Wellem we basically touched his hands and removed blood clots or we held his tools," says O'Malley.
As a medical student in the second anniversary of America, you're never going to experience it.
Volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon themselves and often meet the medical needs of the volunteers.
As soon as he gets to Yaounde, he's afraid, he's transporting and his studio is giving them Belle.
"Surely it's a shame," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its courage to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
It's not a burden for Balley's permanent closure.
Helping the other person to live a happier life, fulfilling a vow that he has made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Walle.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Spreading people out, calming their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát has renewed the function of the Chief Sister for the CRC
The main sister for the CPR should represent the interests of the health sisters whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses of their representative should be represented within the structure of the office - the representatives to whom they may always be referred if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I respect the work of the sister and I think that the Committee of Hospitals deserves due attention from the ministry.
In the performance of this call, there is a need not only for high professionalism but also for human access and personal conviction.
"I'm glad and I'm going to try to apply those steps that can improve the position of the nurses."
"We have excellent and charming sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their access to patients too much to perform all the empathy and help us improve the image of the sister," says Alan Šmídová.
The new appointed Chief Sister for ČR Alena Šmídová also indicated that she wanted to maintain the most diverse aspects of the working position of the nurses and would like to work with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medicines and doctors.
"I don't really want to divide the call of doctors and nurses, but I see them standing next to me, and everyone has their own competence and with other health workers creates a team of buried workers who provide health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I'm dealing with a number of problems that arise when sisters make calls, I can't help but notice and I'm willing to share in their solutions."
They include, for example, simplification of medical and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of sisters are too busy and choose the time they could and should devote more time to patients," says Alan Šmídová.
The other areas to which it is intended to focus include improving working conditions, finding a way to improve cooperation between the team and the management of healthcare providers, training skills and labour law issues such as the maintenance of the labour law or the non-compulsory care of their sisters at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymously lows, which, however, are not documented from any possible position in a specific case where rules may be violated.
"Where there is no complainant, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Sister of the ČR could serve as a guarantee of maintaining anonymity such difficulties and a specific case let the competent authorities check," concludes Alan Šmídová.
Ms. Alena Šmídová studied the Medical School of the Medical Sister (absorbed in 1978) and the University of Karlovy's PhD in Prague in the study programme Osètřövövävävæ - pedagogic (adsultated in 1992).
Since 2010, it has been acting as the lead department of health care and other non-medicine committees and the recognition of qualifications to the Education and Science Committee.
During her career she worked as a nurse at the boarding school, still acting as a teacher at the Secondary School of Health, where she had been statutory deputy director for eight years.
From 2004 to 2009, she acted as the head sister of the United Nations Office for Foreign Affairs.
She published several professional nursery teachers and articles in specialized journals, and presented presentations in the field of nursery.
He is not a member of any political party.
So I don't get mad at hate.
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years, when he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) published a new Roman Vitr, dark, presence.
As far as it is concerned, the number of parties is comparable to its most famous part of Houston (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent contemporary Czech writer, Emil Hakl.
Where'd it happen that you wrote a novel after twelve years of silence?
I've done it... so I don't get angry with hate.
See around you the new and new clones of the human visiting minority, young organisms achieved by blind self-esteem.
I don't even talk about us elders, eyes destroyed by powerless demand, vessling souls, and miscalculating ideologies who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression "little salesmen".
At the beginning of the thousand years, I bought a small digital camera and met my legal friends, wonders and hidden faces.
I've been through it.
Sometimes I feel like my brain burns from my life on this planet.
I don't like going through the walk, and then I read the book in the lamp.
You're talking about the feeling of shame, hate.
Was there some kind of crime that affected you in the past, or are you just getting older like all of us?
The damage happened a long time ago, it took ten years.
There wasn't a name back there.
Well, I lived after that.
There's a guy in there who's always surprised.
I see another personalized quirk, every one in his tortoise.
My writing book saved me.
I take part in this complex, thousands of years of ongoing movement of the life system on this planet - this dispersion of the incomprehensible future.
The unquenchable, breathing complexity of life when every stone is a direct ancestor of our presence.
We are players sad and beautiful games when the path of test-methyl generates another and another generation of habitats that in billions of interactions per second create some supernatural, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years are relatively long.
Are you paying attention to your writing as a transient process, or are you starting from zero?
A self-sustainment, or better said dialogue, which leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes comes out of the stomach and forms into the book.
As the period of peace is covered by the silent metastases of war that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt as if my life grew up in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll get stuck.
It's a file that posed the question of the brain and it's a kind of thing that's stored in the darkness "under cold consciousness".
Nekortex, walking through the brain, asking for older evolutionary exercises, goes to the early lethargys of the brain tree.
She's talking to her mother-in-law, she's asking for an answer in the bird's flight, she's taking her air to the clouds on the surface.
Yes, the law of the moon in me and the stars of heaven trust me.
The brain finally asks for the world.
Relatively often you go to metaphoric egg - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This logistic and emotionally exposed and growing forest with trees of information, memory records, uses the brain in its knowledge, cognitive, process, it is displayed constantly changing presence, in an ongoing effort to name and understand its environment and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's trouble with weight loss.
Analogically - like you would "fall" PC, from the language emulator and interpreter of foreign languages, you would first be asked in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several failed restarts ended in a dark green-like picture of Bios, in the basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the parentboard, between processor and operational memory etc.
For someone who has never understood what it is - I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You talk about her often - why do you like this type of regression regularly?
Because it's apples.
In harmony with the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there is a gap.
It's good to read Nietzsche here: "He's been looking for a waste so long when he's gone looking for him."
It stirs feelings - that a person is lost, if he loses all hope, psychotic "death" and develops a new quality.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll say yes.
When one fell into the darkness and burned himself, ran days, months, and years, he continued to warm up and read, and those books taught him to swim - so to live.
He's been "fucking up."
Perhaps someone will help me with some written knowledge, such as when the Rabal texts helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
The one who can't say anything makes sense, one calls it knowledge, another super ego, but I think it's the best character of Arthur Rimbaud in his letter to his friend:
"I'm someone else -- this reader is directly involved in the process of formulation of words and words."
From the early youth, he read books of ancient Czech accidents, sailed to the port of Captain Nema, ran after Stinadle in the dark streets.
At the same time, after all the books of authors and their messages, it says, "The sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hynka Machy."
What if the book's out there?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
Will you get back to what I'm reading to you?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, perhaps years later, they're able to contact me on the street properly and thank me for helping them in their difficult life decision.
The books are actually "life" or "worlds".
They are encoded in letters, they are not experiences, the history of regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them up to life when we let their veins pass into the brain.
It is in fact, in its way, something forbidden by God - to provide other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the fact that its DNA is placed into a seal - according to the old demonological books, we're going to allow magic.
After the publication of the book you - as it is - waits for a series of author readings.
I remember when you read.
Are you going back to it again with joy, or do you feel that after years?
I'd rather just say that today.
And what did I find out about it?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their main signs - they're unwarranted, too unobtrusive about themselves, they have friends, you don't feel lonely with them.
For example, in the city of the Red Köstelec he (and I hope he is still alive) was one of the codices (also known as Červenka), a happy partner and a good girl.
At one drink, he presented me with individual articles from my teenage book Houstina.
I looked into their eyes and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
I put on my pockets just a couple of days ago, and a short man cried.
We've all been there, we've all stopped, we've been crying and we've got drunk.
Then that young blonde month didn't hold up and jumped through the window into the snow.
It was on the ground.
We ran into the night country and lived happily surrounded by the feelingers, the pain of the souls of the aliens, and the loss of the Western owners - they flew and flew away as fugitives until the morning.
Each of your books is formal and content other than the previous ones.
Is it also about the text of the Wind, the darkness, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a case of one country over the 9th river and the 9th mountain.
Ivan Bunin, in his new Suchodol, includes the words of an old Russian poet: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
She's lying on her ass.
Fear, fear, silence.
It never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Maybe we've been Satans in hell for a long time - what role we're gonna play on this earth.
Do you want to keep writing, or do you let it come back on your free breath?
The answers are eternal - Lake Brézina.
Writing is an amazing way of dialogue.
The huge and unremarkable motion of continents on the planet affects our desire from such depths and within such a wide range that it completely exceeds our attention - and thus, of course, we fly precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are given a lot of dopamine, endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to take care of ourselves, die in the arms and get new personal territories.
Sometimes it gets worse and we get out of it.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various storms, stand on the ocean coast of ignorance and into the raindrops made from a spinal cord covering the airstrip.
I have to write to be human.
Both leave health care
After his criticism yesterday, President Obama came up with his frequent repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can leave it."
With hundreds of thousands of announcements from the Republican suppliers, the president of the United States has been accused of defaming the public in recent days.
Yesterday Obama disappeared from his original promise.
"A large majority of people who have functioning health insurance can leave them," he said in his exhibition in Boston.
In view of what he called "media news" on claims, Obama called the Americans who received this notice to look for new market claims.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
Its administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the citizens who have bought insurance themselves can be introduced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I say this to the Americans at the level: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in his statement before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the release of the Internet market has been "hard".
"I am confused and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sébelius's condolences to this plant, which he seized by a closed microphone, yesterday, addressed to the council of the Committee sitting behind it at yesterday's meeting, which took place following a heated exchange of views with the Republican Billy Longe, a representative from Missouri about whether she had to engage in Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the hearing at Sebelius's repeatedly asked why the "architect" Act on Available Care did not voluntarily give up on the government of the sponsored insurance, and did not buy a program via HealthCare.gov, which now attracts millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the agreement and according to the most diverse sources from the agency and from the background, they are already hand in hand.
The transaction notification should be received again in November, probably before the start of the LTE network frequency auction, then before 11 November.
Keller's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This under the flag of Sazka Telecommunications has been put into the auction for LTE network frequency.
And to the general surprise, by then the company's interest in telecommunications had not been able to speak.
So Sázku is now leading a very experienced telecomal bear Robert Chvatal.
He started as the marketing director of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), later became director of the Slovenian T-Mobile and later head of the same operator's branch office.
The rate is playing a couple of cards right now.
She signed in to the auction, and now she admits she wants to drop the virtual in Vodafon.
And he's giving that logic.
If the auction is successful, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be like under the normal circumstances of Vodafon, but according to the economic news, it can be part of much more cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafones are currently suffering from the O2 and T-Mobile competition agreements that will fully share their network.
That's how Vodafone needs a partner.
And that can be exactly Sazka.
If this success is on the LTE network (as a novelty can attract a particular spectrum), so Vodafone does not have to travel to the auction, it will not lead to the production of only a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
The vodafone can also share with Sazko on the network.
Vodafone sends Sazku into its 2G/3G network (according to the new LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), which enables the firm to start the network quickly.
The gap between this will begin to build a cost-effective LTE network that will be able to use Vodafone.
They can be settled by both companies.
The amount of money spent on Vodafone could then be lost for some of the suppliers of a strong internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
The purchaser of Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian side is the daughter of Czech) would immediately obtain the full value of the operator with still listening gains and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a great deal of trouble waiting for restructuring.
In the auction the LTE network would already have Keller for O2 and very likely in fact with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the network.
The auction could eventually end up successful, but probably not with the high amounts on which the state budget is being welcomed.
And the next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafon, T-Mobile, Keller or Komárk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against global warming.
Is Czech TV ever going to take over without signing?
The president of Zeman launched a legendary scene with a fireman, and it is not difficult to listen to the difficulties that gather evidence of the complaint by the rural community.
In the past no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tördík since he signed it.
True, the conduct has become editors.
The cases described do not provide an answer to the question of how certain journalists are taking such an interest in farmers - whether they respond to direct order, or not to use vulgarism, typical displays of non-local empathy attacks.
And if we are already assuming a general trend, we cannot answer the question whether the change in television ratios is not encouraging others, however, without the gruesome potential interests that have not yet been given the opportunity.
In fact, those who say that there is no political intervention in the developed countries do not come in.
However, the truth is also that this does not mean that there would be no difficulties in public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Rather, they criticize what they consider to be a tendency which they own, which is by the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this stage of civilization yet and we don't have this situation.
But maybe in a country where he thinks he is the most corruptest in the world, black stories about bad politics and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complex descriptions of the unforeseeable situation in which many imperfect human beings act against themselves.
JAN JANDOREK: Damn this country: Presidents of the Power · Global Voices
It is almost the rule that, in key moments, the Head of State was not in such a way as to be able to fulfil its State obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally younger than five years old, he would experience the end of his presidential period and events around Minichov would be a bit different.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance it could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed and the government could rush to London immediately and not fight there for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, he wouldn't have a nation of coke today.
You weren't a stateman, and for Minichov you were still in a condition, but in the war it started out with him, and in the summer of 48 he acted as he did.
Being on something better, he could go into exile and break the legitimacy of the communists and their villages.
It's too bad to talk about Hach.
They let him know that "Mr. President won't get into a situation where he'll be able to solve it."
Well, he had to, even though a big decision was not made with a knife at Hitler's office.
The chief of the research, František Morravec, said in March 1939 that everything should be done so that the occupation he knew about on a certain day did not go so cold and with such profits to the Germans.
The old president and the smart government didn't do anything, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The Human Cost of Gottwald allowed him to fix his flight crews, as Moscow showed him.
Ludvík Freedom was definitely unable to share in normalization and had to sit there for a whole year.
That Husak was weak and sickly old-fashioned in November 89, but that's the only record.
Havel was lucky he hadn't met in the office in the last few years. He's been spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis addict, but many of his works make it clear that thinking processes are no longer what they were.
Well, now we've got this.
The head of the state and the senior leader of the armed forces looks like he looks and we don't know everything yet.
Unfortunately, no external threat to the Republic is present.
Or maybe it's dangerous, it's just not like that.
Then the question is whether it is exceptional (from a historical point of view) that the President is not at all in force.
It's a normal situation, but it's not.
Can't we choose this country as President once again one of the most friendly and friendly people in the world?
Remote planets, black movies or a little fantasy about foreign life on earth are not topics that American jazzer Wayne Shorter would have invented.
In the course of his quarter, which on November 6th, in the great hall of Prague, Lucerny will end the annual festival of Struny in the south, which is all connected to everyone.
The district of the Jazz Xafaonist Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his mission, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they just enjoy.
They approach music as a whole improvised chamber activity and think nothing about harmony or rhythm, even in film pictures.
This principle, however, is a purely eight-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-year-old composer, Grammy, former co-worker Milese Davis, and now the largest live jazz saxophonist - does not explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, although his overall view of life is related to music.
In my 80's, I've come to the conclusion that it's best to let her live surprise herself.
" Too many people are planning everything and then they're lying when things get different," says Shorter.
How the Himsites from Thailand revealed the markets of the Paris Bar
You may get into trouble with your exercise and don't hesitate to eat it half a kilogram a year.
For example, it's ground in the brain.
If you consume it consciously, then you are naturally trends: it is organic, vital and you have a unique experience.
He arranged the offer as the first in Paris on his restaurant list at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, cook and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
Bar, whose name was inspired by the book William Burroughs Nahoy, would be found in fashion 18th season near Montmartru, a visiting tourist.
With a clean lawyer, cooked red peppers, closets and pasta eggs, the guests can taste not only different varnishes, bees, or water broths, but also four.
Careful and specially packaged supplies (to avoid harming the wings, breaking the legs or not harming the eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat mushrooms, somewhere it's common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the probosciscal menu immediately points out several reasons why it consumes exactly the humus.
The first of these is ecologically beneficial because the production of humus is much less expensive for our planet (such as finance, space and water consumption) than traditional mass.
"In addition, it is an excellent source of protein and omega of 3 fatty acids," said Daviron for Reuters station.
At the same time, a young cook does not stop his profession, simply prepares to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant for pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I don't save the world, I'm just going through a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would probably be surprised to see how much they consume the rose of the fine sand, but the response of the customers of the Paris bar to the serviced home is very positive according to the owner.
Even skeptics are finally hungry, even when they start these smallest neighborhoods and until they finally choose Scrapion.
The prices of these recreational trailers are moving from five to nine euros.
President Václav Matáíš ČR business union: New green slums should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been faced with a continuous decline in the scope of the ban and the State is not interested in resolving the problem of the investment building.
The presentation of the New Greens programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the measures have been implemented, reduce significant amounts of emissions, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction weights.
Each billion invested will bring to the state more than 2700 new jobs created.
From the point of view of the State's fiscal policies, there are significant peaceful and multiplicity effects, as well as one of the most important progressive measures.
As a result, the association of enterprises in the construction of the PRC does not in principle agree with the establishment of the government and calls for further steps to be taken to further pursue the programme so that further challenges can be identified within it.

Pes shrnul coberic, president buried and ended up in Berlin
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the motor hospital in Prague, where he spent the night on the bed and went to the castle in Lánech.
What kind of medical condition is he in?
In a previous confession John Kerry said that the American spy "has gone too far"
John Kerry pointed out a change in the U.S. defence situation regarding his follow-up programmes, and in an unprecedented acknowledgement, he said that in some cases the Spanish “went too far”.
The foreign minister also acknowledged that he and Barack Obama were responsible for dealing with the serious discovery of the spying activity of NSA, which was revealed by the informant Edward Snowden.
Public information has caused diplomatic conflicts between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through the video-linked video at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and I have also learned about some things that have been done since we have been here since this opportunity, referring to the second world war, the difficult period of the Cold War, and then of course 11 September."
He thus became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government who admitted that the American spy had crossed the border but stressed that nothing was violated.
He said, "In some cases it went too far."
And the President is determined to try to explain and explain this to people and is now conducting a thorough review so that no one should feel that it has come to an end.
I assure you that in this process it is not possible to abuse the rights of innocent persons.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was working on good and that its follow-up operations saved many lives.
He said, "We are about to enter a new world in which people are eager to take their own souls away."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is strongly determined to kill people in the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented the planes from falling, the buildings were not blown up and the people were not right, because we are already able to learn about these plans.
The President of the Senate of European Affairs said on Thursday that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about certain American Spaniards and convinced Europe that it is still necessary to join its forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other people and that he was worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because they were disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remain on one ship, and in view of its joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, he said in a discussion with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the chairperson of the Senate of Foreign Relations Committee for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism regardless of their relationship with the NSA programmes.
News in the media that NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have damaged relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they have been inexplicable and reflect a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO associations have collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery quoted documents published by Snowden that NSA was following the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angely Merkel and some 34 world leaders.
The director of the national report, James Clapper, called the union spy as necessary and said that it was one of the two sides of common interest.
In the middle of Murphy's turn, he said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year and hopes that members of both sides and chamber will be revealed in the delegation.
The following days shall be published the names of other legislators who are willing to enter.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to help make relations, he added that they would be prepared and "good means of training".
He said that the European leaders must be positive to their own people about the Spanish programmes they are using after years.
"While we are managing our monitoring programmes to better protect European rights, they also need to know that we are not the only ones who are doing Spanish here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is planning this week on the Middle East and Poland to respond to the non-lethalism that has already developed American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran and also the American follow-up.
Australians refused to stay in the Thai prison
A 17-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to fifteen-day prison on the island of Phuket, falsely claimed that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, called against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by the Land Court on the island of Phuket of a cruel charge when the Thai police said that the taxi driver along with two other men who were holding her off earlier on Sunday, 10 June.
However, the industrial television record later withdrew that after she left with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The police from Phuket Island had a conversation with Bamford two days before they found out you were planning an opportunity.
She was held before the trial at the local police station.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days of imprisonment in a correctional facility with a low threat to peripheral in Phuket instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian sick player Peter Tunks who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about his daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's obviously a tough period, but we hope we'll get back to safety first," Tunks said.
Bamford's appeal against the trial was dismissed and was released at the bail of 50,000 bahts.
A report from Australia states that she had a permit in the recreation area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal source in Thailand claims that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a court order that would increase her punishment and release her in prison for adults.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel officer Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to create an embarrassing image for tourists, which may have just remained behind as a liberator.
The game was playing: A ball of bread?
He's got a bullet in his armpit and no one's ever caught him.
The only thing that changed after a quick forhend call.
Jaromír Jágr thus ran against Tampe on Wednesday night, Thursday night after 119th win in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Freebod called on the director of the Czech Drew and asked him if I should not be interested in making a commercial on their most modern Pendolino train!" he wrote on the introduction with the superintendent Jágr.
We're kind of like each other.
I'm probably gonna have to end up with night training so I can't get any faster.
"I'm afraid that after that, the Minister of Defence could call himself and want to make a press release."
New Jersey also won a second victory in line.
"And most importantly, you've noticed that the treatment of Maria Rottrow is taking away," Jagr concluded.
Place of approval of the light bulb
The race elections were more than the winners brought the Cup of Winners.
These are not only the parties that have not yet been admitted (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally also the ČSSD because of their internal origin.
Politicians served us instead of Christmas candles on the weekend's holiday party.
The schokan election became the passion of Andrey Babish, who promised voters to change the traditional political style of government.
The discrepancy of the election result and the vote on the winning side is political (from) because of Mr. Miloše Zeman, regardless of the wish of the voters, who publicly supported or did not choose to vote in the parliamentary Chamber.
The President of the Network has lost a strategic impact on other policies due to unpleasant events, but he still has a few ways to get it back - for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While ČSSD's chances of getting a primer cross are being extended in my eyes, Andrej Babish's entrepreneurs are getting closer.
The development of permits is already far away from the rapid and cold establishment of a stable government, but compared to the ČSSD's double-stakeholder scenario, this development for business in the PRC and thus the economy is only better news.
In view of the vote of UN support to be given together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL coalition (at least 111 Members).
In view of the decline in the ČSSD, which has become an integral and weak partner in the merger, the result of coalification may be sufficient for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD, which is composed of "the Negebs" on the Wall, will probably not pass.
In addition to any government to which the ČSSD will participate, it will be threatened by the infamous ambitions of many social democracies that may be brought before or after the next turn of the country.
So I ask myself, "Don't we go to another early election alone?"
Further elections would be more like a referendum on the strength of the UN's mandate of withdrawal.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a greater increase in income tax or the construction of state banks have fallen below the table.
The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Immediate parties, however, are consistent with business support, high fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), employment support for disadvantaged persons, lower DPH rates for the selected product.
The third areas are most affected by social policy and the size of the state.
Now, however, the ANO has a proposal, so the program is the most likely ANO coalition, ČSSD, KDU-CHSL would be more forwarding.
What I consider to be finally a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on all that is still moving in the economy.
