I remember that.
I remember the last day I walked home in a small car.
Remind me I remembered it once or twice.

Everybody okay?
Is everything okay?
Everything there?
I'll leave school.
I share his political ideas.
Is he interested in me or something?
Is he really coming?
Is his father a doctor?
I got it.
I need to come too.
I gotta run.
I shouldn't have said that.
I didn't have to trust you.
I shouldn't have asked Tom's birthday.
I should've stayed longer.
I've been in my pocket.
I'm Sara.
It's five o'clock.
Does it have a reputation?
Is that serious?
Is that true?
Is that far?
Is it far from here?
It's hard to learn Greek?
May I even have a chance with Tom?
Can you get there in the process?
A rain down?
Is that red?

Is that right?
I dropped one line in a read.
I slept all day, 'cause it was the first day.
I was asleep late.
My hat is straight?
I'm worried all the time.
I'm upset.
Isn't that an area?
Isn't life wonderful?
Isn't that theirs?
I'm breathing sometimes.
Sometimes I'm hurt by the baby.
Sometimes I use numbers as an open box.

I'm staying at home on my first day.
I stayed calm.
I stayed at home all day and read books.
I stayed in town all night.
Do you have tens of thousands in your pockets?
I've been careful about the pressure.

I haven't made my decision yet.
You're still missing me.
I'm still confused that dream will win.
I still think silence is hiding something.
- You're a heavy smoker?
Tom's acting like a line?
Tom War?
A hungry soul?
Did Tom share it?
Tom Socorn?
Tom's full?
I learned very hard.
I suggest you send him a thank-you letter.
I suggest you put the gun down.
I guess I'll have to be more careful in the future.
I guess that's it.
I really pushed your fucking decision.
I suspect so.
I'm afraid Tom doesn't make his own homework.
I guess Tom already knows that.
I swear you don't like it.
I suspect they're putting the beer in the basement.
I'm reporting the chances.
Is your home far from your apartment?

Every night I'm making an ambitia.
I'll be right back.
I'm sending my clothes to him for hard work.
I talked to everyone.
Looks like he's wrong.
It's probably a wedding.
I enjoyed the wine.
It turned out to be more.
It bothers me.
It can be lethal.
It's the future of being a hero.
He can't be busy.
It can get anywhere.
It could happen.
It scares me as honest.
It's definitely a good feeling to give.
It depends on how you deal with it.
Depends on the connection.
It won't be more than three minutes.
It's not on my mind.
It's not even in my mind.
It didn't go that far.
It won't be more than three minutes.
It took a while to get up.
It won't bother us if you take a picture out.
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
Don't pay to play video games.
It doesn't sound like you want my help.
It doesn't seem to matter.
It doesn't sound like her.
It takes a lot of time.
That really sounds good.
I'm a Dutch teacher.
I'm willing to agree with you.
It feels great.
It feels right.
It's so good.
There's a lot of friends here.
I hated to hang on his tree.
I went to Tom about the time he was praying.

It happened here.
It happened today.
It turns out it's true.
We'll be much warmer.
It's going to rain more than three hours.
It's been raining since the first day.

It's pretty young.
It's like fighting spiritual security.
It's like giving Dracula responsibility for the blood bank.
This day looks like a test of courage.
It's time for lunch.
It smells good!
I don't want to share it with anyone!
It's more difficult than I thought at first.
It's morning.
It's my duty to help you.
