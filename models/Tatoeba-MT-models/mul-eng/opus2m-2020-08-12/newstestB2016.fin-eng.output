There was a 9-year-old boy at Tampere's.
The police have been looking for a 9-year-old boy because of his car accident in Tampere last night.
The report on a boy leaving from West Tampere with his friend has been published in the social media.
According to the police station, his son has been contacted, and he does not have a risk to his life and health.
The boy's father told the Night Sanomi that he had found the boy.
He's all right, and now we're starting to figure out what's going on.
The boy was found from the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again soon - repi painting in the Messiah
Christian Ronaldo took five maps over Spain for a weekend and continued his work over the Masters.
Lionel Messin and Christian Ronaldo's view of the Masters' overcrowding turned at least for at least a moment into the last success.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all time's groundbreaking statistics when he shot a visitor on the Shahtar Donetsk network two pieces of punishment and one game situation.
Ronaldo won his 80th medal before he joined him in a match at Barcelona's Messil. He has 77 pieces.
Real won the prize 4-0.
Juventus is originally composed of Italian football in Series A, but in the Masters' D-class, it started with a 2-1-way force from Manchester City.
The winning board made a ten-minute round before the end of the Youth Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was triggered by an infuriating Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who died during the weekend's election, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
Also, Manchester's second U.S. follower experienced severe PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands with 1-2 hit.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old deputy in Manu, will be visiting for only one hour.
The PSV's dangerous escape from Hector Moren came to the ground towards an attack on ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke down the roof.
Shaw was born in Eindhoven, about ten minutes before the medical staff sent her to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took you to the 1-0-minute tour, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno had a fever before he had an extra time.
The PSV battle hall was built by Luciano Narsing on the other side.
Over the course of the painting, the A-group of the Masters started Paris Saint-Germain.
In this case, the Austrian Angel Di Maria was replaced by the PSG in addition to the Manchester Unit.
Di Maria walked right through the palace and ended up on the ground floor of Malmö, Johan Willand.
Edinson Cavani made another half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been neglected in a group of successful people.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is too small, is not the best possible comparison.
For the first time, PSG's Starfleet Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional director Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malm in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moskova TsSKA disappeared at the B-band in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately asked for a divorce - Mr President, it was wrong.
The president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, spoke the same way he had been holding a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has been holding the country's parliament once again in the same speech as he had at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not obviously feel the same way during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full power.
The MDC’s lead party asked Mugabe to separate because this is too old to manage.
Mugaben's assistants rushed to say that the disturbance had only occurred in Mugaben's presence and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben spoke earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an overarching summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have introduced a summit of EU leaders for the first week because of the refugee crisis.
Mr Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council for Summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe can be more effectively registered.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are based on the table of the Ministers of the Interior, according to Merkel.
The professor admits in an emergency call his girlfriend shot
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University called for a few important police officers at his home and told him that his girlfriend had been shot.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their love dog was in place and alive and probably scared. The professor said that after the death of a woman’s family, the contact information would be on the woman’s phone.
Inside the store, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and the white paper I signed a letter written: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo my act. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," in a letter signed by Lambin, including the authorities.
There was no sign in the store that Lamb, who had taught two online courses at Delta State University in the Mississipin Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the top of the school campus. The police found from the camp in his working room a dead man named Professor Ethan Schmidt, who is believed to have been shot.
The police officer of Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said that the university official had received information about the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb called his emergency call sometime after this.
One more chance of death came on the day, and Lamb himself stood by his soul when the police were looking for him.
The next day the students and the teaching staff were standing behind the doors that were apparently closed, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motives.
The researchers discovered details in both communities, and Lambin’s feelings taught him about a man. The researchers were born with a gifted picture of a problem teacher.
The students were always waiting for the teacher's feelings.
According to Gautier's police at the Prentisssian death camp, there was no previous violence or crime.
Schmidt had, therefore, mentioned in Lambin's book, which had given recognition to "good people", with which he was able to destroy academic life.
Both worked on social sciences and history, which included 17 persons. Many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
Lambia, a high school student, Brandon Beavers, said that the professor was moved by a sense of urgency and a feeling of "if he had anything to do with it."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb had been told about the stress he suffered at the end of the year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously been anonised from Delta State University because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's wage policy meant that the claim that Lamb had worked hard for him would not automatically be returned to him by his assistant professor's office.
The director of the university, William LaForge, said there was no known dispute between Lambin and Schmidt, but he admitted that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
The police from the camp found out what the train Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police were directed to Lambin, he had fought himself on a 38-calibrated gun at the back of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about half a mile from his parents' home, told the death investigator in Washington, D.C., Methel Johnson.
Lambin's car was still on the road.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house.
He threw himself into his youth zone.
Lamb started work as a teacher at a university with 3,500 students. There were 12 000 residents in the city in 2009 .
He got a doctor's degree in growth.
One of Lambin's longest friends described this as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me about his encounter with Lamb's fellow friends when he was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old.
He was still a friend, and Lamb had to be interested in the older guy who had been trying to teach him a guitar game for years.
"Lamb was then a pretty heart attacker.
All the girls were at her bedside," said Hariston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's capital city in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently met for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb told his wife that he had killed her, but no document says they're upset.
The couple had a dog named Lighting, and they lived in a restaurant in Gautier's small town.
According to the police, the dog was okay.
The Prentissian former husband Shawn O'Steen told him that he was separated from the Prentiss 15 years ago. The parish church had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was really upset," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lambi, but they heard his daughter say that Lamb loved music and called blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail were both present during the three - year period.
Later, they called each other together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter's collecting and presenting her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who made a lot of business work online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time leisure coordinator at The Jule Room restaurant outside Gautier, told him on 5 September when Lamb had called a guitar and a loud voice to a rare audience.
There was nothing to say that something would have been scared.
"Good Parish," Shaffer said.
"We laughed together.
They both had a good smoker."
"The survey led Professor Schmidt to the first year's seminary and was dedicated to the history of the Indians and the transfer time," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
She was married, and she had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his own brotherhood and university.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered in the memory center. Among them were teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the evening event where the university panel presented the chapters "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching continues in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to get students back," said LaForge.
"The crisis is over.
This is a day of improvement."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Miss Sippin Cleveland.
Contributors: Associated Press Providers Emily Wagster Pettus Mississipin in Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The matter has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb called after Schmidt was shot, and it was also clarified that although Lamb referred to Prentissian's wife in an emergency, their marriage is not evidence.
Toys R Us is going to hire fewer cooks
The Toys R Us company is not going to hire as many bakery workers as it has been in recent years. However, the resales of toys and baby products tell current workers and cookers about the additional feelings of the possibility.
The company is planning to hire 40,000 people for sales and distribution centres in different parts of the country. In 2014 it paid 45,000 rent workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The candidates' challenges will be started this month, and new workers will begin in late-July.
Although there are still months of unemployment, the trade season is nearing a good pace, and companies are preparing to pay temporary labour for sales and the delivery of goods and supplies.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "his date" with Princess Diana
Back in the future, the first night of the film was a significant moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
Last night there was also personal importance.
"We were sitting in the theater and waiting for the king's arrival. I noticed there was an empty place next to me. I realized that Princess Diana was coming to me," Fox told the next Back in Time document trailer.
"When the film began, I realized that the situation was very much in the way of encountering Princess Wallace."
Back in Time documents are linked to the future pictures and are challenged in addition to Fox's Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as leader Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
After the future, the film was first won 30 years ago.
"This movie is definitely a time-consuming picture of all times," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be presented in the selected movie properties from October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military activities and pointed out that there is no military solution to the five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions.
The Secretary-General once again invited all parties, including the UN Security Council, to combine their strength and support extensive negotiations to find a political solution.
In a press conference held on Wednesday, the Ban stated its intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted that the expansion of the Security Council, the people of Syria and the regional powers have caused a situation which is impossible to solve.
Ban invited five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis as achieved by the Iran nuclear agreement.
8 number of support questions: Is Donald Trump really?
The trumpet has been trying to be an empty chat room.
She's also been held to be a joke.
Some of them predict the fall of Trump.
The Republican borders have (in other words) tried every means to take the lead under Trump.
Ten of the 11 national rounds show Donald Trump two-digit support classes. The part is already seriously based on what it actually tells us about the possibilities of the construction module.
The choices are really only at the beginning.
Nothing has yet been said that Trump is elected as a representative of the Republicans.
The experts recall that Rick Perry, who was at the 2011 Gallup Camp, was granted a status for Herman Cain. No one finally won a candidate election together in the country.
There would be many reasons why the trumpet would be difficult in general elections.
External groups such as Jeb Bushian Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's strong position and began looking for him to look at.
The following young galluptic data show that stability modules cannot be paged with source sources:
There's been a complete regulation in the case of the trumpet.
Just before Trump announced that he had been appointed as a candidate in mid-June, only two ten Republicans of the University of Monmouth had a positive picture.
By mid-June, 40 percent had been positive.
The corresponding share at the beginning of August was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans, Donald Trump is a positive man.
About three out of ten men are negative.
These chapters are also held in the countries where the elections are organized first.
In the last week, 60 per cent of the Republicans in the Quinnipiac Gulf had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be satisfied with the Trump proposal.
At the CNN and ORC summit last week, 67% of the Republicans indicated that they were very satisfied or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump.
Only two of the ten would be very displeased with the Trump proposal.
Ben Carson will receive almost as much as Trump at the time (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's proposal and 40% with Trump's proposal).
Who's the next one I've recommended?
The third is Marco Rubio, whose corresponding strength is 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans would be either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were to be elected as a candidate for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature to be a problem.
Donald Trumpia has been widely criticized for his strong and cutting comments. 52% of the supporters of the Republicans throughout the country hold the properties of the real estate permit as appropriate to the President.
The same is true of Iowa, where the defence assembly is organized as the first: 52 per cent of the Republicans consider the personal characteristics of the Trup to be appropriate for the defence forces.
However, according to the ABC and Post Gallup, 44% consider that Trump is not able to function effectively in the task, and six tenths consider the temperature of Trump to be inadequate in the White House.
The Republicans are starting to get used to thinking.
They're starting to deal with Trump.
When the Republicans are informed who is most likely to be elected as a candidate for the most likely party, the CNN and ORC Group of the four ten believe in the possibility of Trump.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four tenths of them would have put their money in the pocket for Jeb Bush.
Total: The Republicans have not previously had a highly reliable crystalline fuel in use.
At this stage in the last four ten republican elections, Rick Perry was likely a candidate, and only 28 per cent of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think that Trump's campaign is an insurance campaign.
Although the Republicans would support another proposal, Trump will hide almost all the other proposals.
Some experts believe that the split lead is likely to benefit from the trumpet when the opponents of the trumpet share various sponsors.
In early September, the opinions of the Monmouth University revealed that in the imaginary bickering between Trump and almost any other republican group, Trump would have a larger support team almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorina on 13 points, Marco Rubiota on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bushia on 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichia and Chris Christie on 33 points each.
Ted Cruzin and he's at level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson won a 19-point win in the imaginary double-pound.
A small majority of the supporters of Trump have already made a voting decision.
According to the CBS and NYT published in September, half of the supporters of the Trump are sure of their voting decision.
The situation may change for a number of reasons, and at this moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of the supporters of the trumpet have not made a final decision.
The top competitors of the trumpet right now are neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who have already voted on their proposal vote twice more likely than the trumpet.
Six out of ten Republicans agree to see Trump move.
In his campaign address, Donald Trump, two months ago, came from Mexico to transfer to pregnant women, has been a hot topic in 2016.
Part of the concern is that the powerful words of the Trump are a threat to important Latin American voters from the republican groups and a threat to the reform of the brand.
However, according to the ABC News and Washington Post opinion reports published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines with Trump.
As long as the transfer is in the light, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfied management is in vain.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now gathering together about half of the Republicans' votes.
ABC News and Washington Post, according to the recent opinion of the Republican Group, was one of the six republicarians.
These two proposals are also attractive to Washington.
According to a report by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three fourths of the Republicans in Iowa have destroyed the activities of the Republicans at the congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% are unhappy with the parties."
Jeremy Corbyn Debated the Prime Minister at Question Time
After the election, Corbyn was expected to take the lead in the question hour by the Prime Minister
On the other hand, the new labour's new artist Jeremy Corbyn is about to rise for the first time to measure his strength by David Cameron's question hours later.
Corbyn asks the first six questions after a few half days. The media and the representatives of the working party are following a man's face very hard.
Corbyn has taught less theater and more facts for a weekly show.
He has also found that he can leave part of the meetings and leave them with fellow Members.
At the meeting, Corby's leadership will be discussed for the first time.
The decision to look at the Labour Party during the National Conference on Civil War at the 75th anniversary of the Ison-British Air Force has been criticised by several representatives of the Tory Party. The debate has also been decided on the priorities of several speakers.
Corby's imagination was highlighted during the national anthem
The representative of Corby told Corby on his side during the national prayer, respectfully respecting the sanctions of the Royal Air Force in the UK.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a member of Corby's Secret Management, told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would have invited the leader of the party to join the national song despite the responsibility of this monarch.
The Ten Secret Ministers have refused to leave, according to Corby's separatists, for differences in economic, defence and external matters.
BBC policy writer Robin Brant believes that political differences between the EU membership of the Ison-British Union and the conditions for granting benefits to the government have taken place in the workplace after the name of Corby.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that the Labour will propose changes to remove restrictions completely.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pension of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the position on the side is very clear: it is opposed only to the government's plans to limit 26 000 points to 23 000 points.
Corbyn is the fifth Director of Labor, who has been with David Cameron for the past decade under the direction of the Tory Party.
The new approach policy-makers, Labour's leader, said that he would like to ask Cameron the questions of 30 000 proposals from the public.
According to Islington North, the polling hour has too much connotations. He also promises to avoid harsh words and tolerance and instead say that he focuses on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has found that Deputy Minister Angela Eagle will bring her to the hour after Cameron's out.
Corbyn has also rejected the idea that others might also be able to vote in the other voice, and she will tell her debate with President John Bercowin of Parliament on the subject.
Corbyn's rise to the side of the board in 2005 pointed out that he wanted to become a sleep-thematic policy, which was often linked to the questionnaires, but some years later he acknowledged his failure in his attempt.
Since the first television interview in 1990, it has been regarded as a key measure of the leadership's competence, management of the premises and position. However, according to critics, the questionnaire has become a caricature that needs considerable reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": unaccompanied young photographer
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for homeless people.
An interesting way to learn and serve has been found for a group of former Catholics.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a winning unintended painting studio where unaccompanied young people are taught to take pictures at home and deserve the same.
The BBC News met a young man who was prepared through the project in the first group.

The point is confirmed at the rise of the British Ison
The point was confirmed by the rise in wages in the United Kingdom, and SABMiller received an increase in the FTSE 100 index.
In May, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the United Kingdom compared to the previous year's corresponding period. The benefits were not calculated.
The accelerated growth was rapid back then in 2009.
The bridge was established by 1 % and its course was recorded at $1,5505. The bridge was also established in relation to the euro and was recorded at EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was SABMiller, whose course dropped by 20% when the company received the initial purchase offer from AB InBevil.
In this context, trade would bring together two large printing companies in the world and other fuels under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry share increased by 0.9 per cent in the age of the positive results of the Richemont group, which was competitively focused on public products.
Richemont's most efficient sales licenses are forecast to be better. The development of the sale was also the result of growth in the opening market in Burberry in China.
Glencoren’s share increased by 5 per cent of its annual share of its share of $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
My packaging and paper company’s shares in Mondi were the largest dropout of 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company’s shares for sale.
JD Sport's course rose by 3.1 per cent after the company announced that its production before tax increased by 83 per cent to 46.6 million points.
JD Sports -pomo: larger wages could be affected by enlargement
According to JD Sport's chairman, Peter Cowgill, the minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs associated with the company.
According to Cowgill, rising labour costs can jeopardise JD Sport’s expansion plans and reduce the need for additional power.
Metcash launchs a food raid campaign against Aldin's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA sales from Aldi's power in South and West Australia.
Metcash has launched a food chain campaign to maintain the IGA retail market share of the South and West Australia Aldin $700 million against Australian investment.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and even the first 120 sales in South and West Australia at the beginning of the first year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in media and social media, as well as by organizing events like Adelaide-show.
IGA salesmen and customs operators as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. Simmo's ice cream shop in Dunsborough offers Maternal IGA stores, and traders sell lifts to customers in South Australia’s football matches at low prices.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on the defence strategy on 29 September, when food, alcohol and railway trade will be organised on an annual investment day.
This is an important market since South and West Australia is nearly 30 per cent of Metcashhi IGA sales chain, and in these areas the product is larger than the IGA sales network of the Eastern States.
South and Western Australian consumers are known for their ruralness, and IGA competitions also have a significantly higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, market share is 30 per cent and 24 per cent in Western Australia, while in Western countries only 14 per cent.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food markets in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first retail markets.
This week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA companies could amount to 360 million and the sale of Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The advantage is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 sales in South and West Australia in the first year and sell 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so the loss of food sales and supply can mean a loss of $13 million in the result of the losses before the rise and taxes, Kierath's reality.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the western countries, mainly Aldi and Coles, although, according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA customers are the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week Magellan Financial Group leader Hamish Douglas told Melbourne that it was very likely that Metcash would disappear within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take public position on Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash Government contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has fallen by 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 per cent, and the result of the Metcash food business, which serves as a reseller of 1200 IGA, has fallen by 43 per cent from 2012 level.
However, business operators will take action and make an annual rate of over 150 million Australian dollars in response to the prices of Coles and Woolworths per week for hundreds of products. Kätje wants to support businesses in refurbishing sales volumes so that they can increase supply of products and improve their own brand choice of food.
According to Metcash supplier Ian Morricen, price revision and sales reform plans are in good shape, and the company is able to grow its profit once again in 2017 for the first four years.
President of the Australian Tennis Union Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves its use instead of the crisis of specialisation.
According to the president of the Australian Tennis Union, Steve Healthy, Thanas Kokkinakis has been a victim of a recent attack on Nick Kyrgyzstan. Kokkinakis deserves special treatment instead.
As a result of "Special K" the younger part of the two named Kokkinakis was forced into an undisclosed fight when the wicked son of Kyrugios challenged his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the ATP market in Montreal.
Shortly after this in Cincinnati, the judge between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison had to separate the competitors from each other. "Wawrinka should have given a clear answer to the Kyrgyz and my friend," Harrison suggested.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis was excavated in the field when powerful cramps took his revenge. Healy has been faithfully defended from Kokkinaki.
At this point, there's a workshop in Glasgow where he's fighting Sam Grothin, a single double player behind Bernard Tomic, in Davis Cupin's semifinals against the British Isoa.
"I firmly believe that Thanas has been led by his argument," Healy said.
"He broke down the painting by destroying the painting in the open United States. He is not the first player to break his painting because of the ruin of his painting. I know Thanas well that he's not doing it very well.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the pro-use use of Harrison in the U.S. openings, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a beautiful family around him, and I think he's just a little misjudged.
He's very capable at 19 years of age, he's doing hard work and he's been very teamy. He's never had problems with other players, and he's respected in the middle of the players. He's practicing hard, he's in good shape and really strong and capable young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop from Kyrugios Australia's team as a starting point from the important cycle. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties. However, she supports the return of Canberra to the group as a long-term confirmation.
"At first, we want to focus on the complete lessons on Kyrgyzstan instead of anything," Healy said.
Like Federer and Murray have noticed, the young man must be caught in the light of the public. He deserves to be criticized for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions. We also try to organize his own peace. I believe it is best for the entire group and Nick."
European Transit Crisis: Hungary announces emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
The emergency announced by Hungary closed its southern border from Serbia as a hostage and arrested illegal migrants. The aim was to prevent the transfer authority.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of immigrants were applied to non-neglect countries, and Serbia's authorities reacted violently.
People who had left the country had to stay within their borders for an unlimited period of time
The security began to rise on the surface.
On the plane of the police helicopter, they flew over the air, "Open the border!" and shouted in applause to the Hungarian melancholy police.
Some started protesting at the food and drink store.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it would not accept the transferees to be sent back to Hungary at the same time as further from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, no further damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Within six months, the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common transitional policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed that 40 000 asylum-seekers in Italy and Greece are in common, and at the meeting, they hoped that an agreement would be reached by the end of the month or year, which would be taken by the EU Member States against 120,000 transfers, including from Hungary.
The Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, invited the school to attend an additional summit next week in order to discuss the asylum crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for long-term action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
In the meantime, the emergency situation has developed so that the two authorities in the southern region have been able to take more effective measures to stop you and speed up legal processes related to asylum matters.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Hungary is also planning to help the border of Romania in order to prevent the border from being closed, now that Serbia's border is ready to help.
CBS News's writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were involved in the tendering of local goods between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit cap for the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and others in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that most of the people who have reached the age of life are non-combatants who have the right to seek security, seeing different aspects of the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to a new law in Hungary, it is a crime to exceed or damage four metres of high-speed local time, which the government has implemented to the southern border towards Serbia. The laws also provide for longer prison terms for sentenced persons.
"The government will declare the country’s crisis due to the situation caused by mass change," said the government’s rapporteur, Zoltan Kovacs, told suppliers in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We're going to take a tight line: the bordering of the station is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to take military action which is expected first week.
Orban's internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had taken over 45 border crossings at an immediate limit and 15 longer.
By harming the border, people who have crossed the border are now under police control, and they are charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
Officials are trying to fix it.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings on the border with Serbia as well as one border crossings were closed by means of a bridge.
Kaeos conquered the capital of Roszke near Hungary when the Hungarians opened a small metal bag to issues where people were packaged inside.
About 20 people were allowed inside, but thousands were left outside.
The second group supported the summit which unites Serbia and Hungary. People announced their presence in food and drink until they were delivered to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leader Bernie Sanders in accordance with the National Gallip
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support percentage is still a double-numbered presidential candidate for democracy. However, Senator Bernie Sanders has been devastated by an unexpected turn of events.
Clinton's support is now 47 per cent of the voices of the Democrats (slow 58 per cent), while Sanders is another 27 per cent (high 17 per cent).
The Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced the possible origin of his presidency, with 15 per cent of his support for democracy.
More than five months before the majority of democracies are asked who they are to support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more likely to choose from other sponsors.
CBS News has lost the support of a number of democratic groups since the last month of the game, while the Sanders League has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a difficult leadership position between women and the Maltese, but the leadership has slowed down.
Clinton's support in the middle of men has fallen significantly, and he's got only five percent lead on Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership in the middle of the 50-year-old democracy, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear position in the middle of the senior voters.
In the recent month, the success of Clinton's success in terms of tolerance in the centre of liberalism of Sanders was double, but now Sanders has taken up five percentage points in Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats report their support to Clinton's opinion if he is elected as a candidate for the Party.
Fourthly, Clinton would support small savings, and 15 percent would only support him because he's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton would be particularly enthusiastic supporters even if they were selected as sponsors.
There is more confusion in the vision of those who are not currently suffering as Clinton. Only about a quarter of them would support him in an invigorating way.
48% of the Democratic People's Republicans would support Clinton, and only 35% of the Republican Republicans would support the most strongly recommended presidential proposal by Donald Trumpi.
When Clinton's voters are asked to explain freely why they support his proposal, the recommended ground is Clinton's right experience (16 per cent). Secondly, the answer is that it is time to choose the President (13 per cent) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
In addition, the common views and opportunities are mentioned to overcome the root choices.
The Vice-President continued his proposal, and 57% of the Democrats would expect him to leave, and the third would leave him at his own disposal.
When democracyists are informed of the second recommended candidate for the party's proposal, most of them choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters over the side of Biden after Clinton, I recommended the second and significantly better Sandersia.
If Biden doesn't go to democracy's proposals, Hillary Clinton will grow its progress towards Sanders. Sanders' share of the promotion is 20 per cent, and it will grow to 30 per cent if Sanders doesn't go to jail.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton a candidate who has the best opportunity to win foreign elections. However, the share has declined from 78% over the last month.
The Biden, which is both far from Clinton, believes more and more in Biden's chances of winning the foreign elections.
However, Democrats consider it more important to take into account the potential of the proposals.
The voters do not consider any democratic or possible proposals to be acceptable.
The voters shall consider democratic proposals or possible proposals to be appropriate to their characteristics.
Most of Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia are considered to be real, reliable and leadership.
The Bidens are most likely to be true, while Clinton is often considered to be the type of leader.
Of the Democrats, even 30% do not consider Clinton to be true and reliable, Sandersia is 15%. 27% do not know if Sanders is true.
From the point of view of the Democrats, the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to their own ideology.
There is no opinion on all aspects of Sanders.
When voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its service as Foreign Minister, most of the democratic voters are told that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed the attitude of these voters from Clinton.
The Americans are more of a different sort of mind.
Half of Americans are not satisfied with Clinton's discovery, and only one third are satisfied.
The people’s opinions were shared in March, when the explanation had just become public.
Most Americans believe that the use of conflicting e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the ideal has changed to a negative direction.
Of these 36 percent, six out of ten, are republicans.
Although the voters on their side consider Clinton to be true and reliable, there is a need to improve the situation in these circumstances when it comes to the views of all voters: Clinton considers that only 32 per cent is true and reliable, which is 8 per cent less than last month and 15 per cent less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton to be real and reliable.
On the other hand, 55 per cent of all voters throughout the country are also not considered to be true and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, receive good guidance.
Six of the six issues with which the proposed Bideni, Carson and Bush were considered more reliable.
Most people think Sanders is real, but just like Carson, many don't have Sanders' opinion.
The receipt of the question is 351 votes, and the error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson holds Donald Trump's lead in national support
According to CBS News and New York Time's most recent support question, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two proposals were more than half of the votes in the new issue and left other proposals for a long time to come back.
In the middle of the country's Republican representatives, Trump has still had a strong support. The support rate has risen before Fox News's last month's claim of 23 per cent of CBS's issue. According to one published question, the rate of support is 27 per cent.
Carson's support, however, would rise significantly over the same period, from 6 per cent to 23 per cent.
According to the question, Carson has a strong support for all groups of people.
Other proposals, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasach, will be long behind. The support of Governor Scott Walker is weakened and has fallen from 10 per cent in the last month to 2 per cent.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, divided the third into 6 per cent.
The error margin of 376 Republican nationals is 6 per cent or so. The question was made in September.
According to the most recent issue of CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is rising, and he supports 19% of the Republicans when Trump's support is 32%.
In the new issue of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also clearly responsible for Carson.
During the last week of the men's encounter, Trump filed outstanding charges against the sleepless neurosurgeon. However, Carson apologized for his questioned Trup's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Sunday at the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the department charged with Baruch College's death
Nearly two years ago, in Pennsylvania, Poconovoire, five people were murdered after the death of a student in the department's ritual.
Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Psi team members were badly injured by Juan "Michael" Deng's hostages in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not provide Dengi in time to the hospital, which was considered to have an effect on his death.
According to the authorities, the eyes of the victim had been tied, his face had been set on a 15 - mile [15 km] long, and his struggle had been repeated as he tried to reach a point that had been placed on the other side of the member’s neck.
Deng is first told by the headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Psi department didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost his consciousness. They're supposed to be waiting an hour before Deng's hospital is taken to the hospital.
Mr. Chris Wabner told the press that the members, however, had to change Deng's clothes, go ahead and contact the department's president, Andy Meng.
"At this stage the members began to hide the instruments by putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner noted.
The rain was not healed, and he died the next morning.
According to the book Body Disorders, Dengi had been beaten several times by the head, upper arm and left side of the road.
" Too many families have had to suffer from the breakdown of the department, as at least one student has died as a result of the collapse since 1970," said the representative of the Deng family, Douglas Fierberg in his opinion.
The departments and their members shall be responsible for taking an important step by the authorities.
Five members of the department were accused of a third-level murder.
In addition, the members of the 32 division are accused of conspiracy and criminal secrecy.
"We want to get responsibility not only for individuals, but also for an organization officially or informally approved," Wagner told the press.
The Baruch College set up a department's function, and the national department was expelled from the operation of the local department.
This is how the rise of the United States Central Bank (Fedin) is affected by the rise in its peaks
The rise in prices and the rise in market share increased, the production of securities increased and the economy collapsed.
We know that.
Still, we don't know how long it takes all of us to keep up with the effects.
Especially in the case of the economy, we find a history of how to draw attention to time.
The lama has reached even 11 months after the first rise and has lasted even 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively uplifting, not always. The root cause is how the economy and financial resources react.
Therefore, the central banks’ officials have already stressed that investors would not pay attention to the beginning of the rise of the peaks but to how long the normalisation of the situation takes.
That's what's going on with a lot of changes.
Finally, however, market operators may be aware that all high-level high-speed noise can be excessive.
"The first rise in the central bank after the global financial crisis was often interpreted as a significant end to poor money," Julian Jessop, the head of the global economy of the capital economy told customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of the peaks to a low level, which is a lot of fear of standing.
However, it does not mean that it would not have any effect.
Examples based on historical trends are how the effects can be seen in different areas of the economy:
As the market has already seen for about a month, the rise rate of peaks may increase uncertainty for some time.
When the hills rise in the evening, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend would appear to be the rise in capital surplus products for the first 12 to 24 months after the first rise, which is due to a slow return in monetary policy, the Deutsche Bank's analysis of the impact of the recent rise in growth.
Over 35 years the market has generally seen a steady rise during peaks, about 14 per cent, almost 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), 500 days after normalising the situation, and 14.4 per cent after six partial orders, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management Chief Equity on Barron's page.
According to Deutschen, the effect on components usually becomes more effective in a slightly later stage of cycle and crop production begins to decrease.
The lion is real in the economy, but the rise in the mountains is generally due to it.
In this case, if the central bank is confronted with conditions that were not previously existing and which could speed up the calculation process.
A special point is that the gross domestic product is at least at the lowest ever to rise in the central bank’s leadership course.
According to Deutsche Bank, at the 118th level of the Governing Body then in 1950, only the nominal value was under 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 appears to be 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it sustainable, and the third quarter was 1.5 per cent, says the Atlantic Regional Central Bank.
On the rise of the mountains in this low economic situation, it can be at risk and it can be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market operators have been talking about the rise of the steering group throughout the year and have also been looking at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which will end in the autumn.
Many strategies and economies believe that while the Open Market Committee will accept the rise at this meeting, the futuristic figure is only 25% likely.
"In our research since 1950, all rise cycles have been in a supercycle, which also increases very quickly after the start of the rise", says the report.
It has been very late compared to the worst snake in the Internet.
The cycle is clearly a peak which the central bank has been waiting for since last year. The advance has been 35 months, now it's already gone 74.
Fixed-productive securities have also been uncertain on market issues, and the plan is also being repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact is in group bonds faster than in shares when the central bank changes rates.
In the case of group books, the product appears to be changing immediately when the first rise/down cycle is started.
At the end of the resurrection cycle, the products are immediately calculated," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategicists believe that the corrosion will get long-term and short-term group bonds to approach each other and recalibrate them.
"The high-performance group paper is often better in this environment, even though we are still cautious about products," said Kathy Jones of the Schwabi real-product paper analyst.
Unfortunately, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the adjustment of inflation services to the strengthening of the financial policy, there are many visible signs," Jones says.
Short-term increases are rising, production fluctuations are direct, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased. All are in a similar situation in the market where the central bank distorts policy.
With a broad range of companies operating mainly on the US market, they benefit because the high level of production is declining and local products are becoming attractive.
The views of debted multinational companies are weaker, as a strong dollar can be valued for their products on the global market and debt.
"History shows that quality acts are more productive in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts tell customers.
Firms with a strong level were exposed to low-level enterprises in 1994, 1999 and 2004 at an average level of five percentage points.
The companies whose capital production is high and the shares of the lower Voliticity also achieved a better quality, an average of 4 and, respectively, a higher percentage of 3 percentage points.
"It's a big question.
Companies that have a significant share of exchange rates of debt are losing most," Goldman noted.
Consumers outside the common market are generally also benefiting from the strengthening of the dollar.
Rescuers also benefit from higher production. Experts are really different from how fast the effects are seen.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 copies of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station's popularity.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult for the canal to distinguish itself from its commercial competitor.
Displays also the BBC Music Awards payroll area as a copy of the British Gaal.
On behalf of Parliamentary Commissioner Damien Collins, The Voice is accused of being inhumane.
According to the significant parliamentary record, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC that the radio channel of the general radio company is becoming too popular and no longer is channeling its trade competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 feels like a change in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
BBC Music Awards, which was also organised last December, receive criticism from Bingham:
"For the first time in the last year, the BBC Music Awards are influenced by a copy of the British payroll.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, only what is already on the market is being visited," Bingham says.
The head of BBC rejected the charges and claimed that BBC Radio 3 offers a commercial competitor significantly more live music and choice of content.
"Radio 3: I learned classical music from what I can't learn from other channels.
The Cana’s commitment to live music and music is exactly its own category.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 has also committed to looking for new music and setting up new texts," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Director Alan Davey said that the position must be more difficult to keep public interest in, as the British know more about classical music than ever before.
However, Radio 3 is not the only source of critical criticism of the audition of commercial canals by the BBC channel, in the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
The Voice was awarded by the Parliament of the Tory Party by Damien Collins, who bought BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Medalta. The price of trade is estimated at 22 million pounds.
"The programme will not just discuss it, because it is not unique or especially separate."
According to Lord Hall1, the program presented by BBC1, which is an excellent starboard for Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to look for its own funds when it next launchs a new holiday season.
However, Collins did not agree to close down the fact that The Voice series would continue to be laid down or that taxable money would be used in other forms of entertainment.
Network trade growth at all times in August – due to the Black Springs
In the first month of 2015, net sales increased by seven per cent.
The sales of online commerce have been estimated since 2000. The last month's growth was a trend of all times.
The online trade was confirmed three years ago by mobile.
Experts believe that in November, the black spring may slow down shopping.
Over a period of more than ten years, the government of the network has assisted many of the UK’s purchase plans.
Experts say there are references to the balance of online trade, and new sales licenses show only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was shocking all the time when sales of the network were recorded from 2000 onwards. In the last year, the net sales increased by only five percent.
Experts say there are references to the balance of online trade, and new sales licenses show only seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare the growth in the last year to the readings of 2000, it is clear that growth is going to be equal over time," IMRG chief executive Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online sales were accelerated three years ago when consumers paid for mobile phones.
"As a result, more and more were able to buy from the network, and for many it was possible to buy in different environments, even if I did.
When mobileization is more cheap now, growth can be remedied."
The black spring from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one reason for slowing down growth.
According to the experts, the day of the latest November event may allow consumers to break the purchase decision before the black holidays.
In the last year, the five-digit number of web users compared to normal was lost by many of their trading sites.
Experts believe that the black market, which allows consumers to feel on the basis of the offers, may delay purchases at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair score of every five points was spent online.
Some products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online markets over a third.
At the same time, more than four quarters of people buy clothes and clothes from the network instead of purchased form transactions.
In Mexico, there are nostalgia of victims, the Bin Laden family's responsibility
Muslims carried 29 bodies of victims on the streets when the first funerals were held in Mecca.
According to Saudi-Arabi, the expansion of the building of Saudi Binlad Group is part of an accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were killed after being killed.
The bodies were placed in high air when the Muslims assembled to bury the lost nostril on the Great Mekka
The streets had gathered a group of white-headed people to leave their well-being on these last journey to Al-Moaissem's homeland.
He walked along a holy place where the fallen construction industry was just days away from the mosque’s roof over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia demanded that Bin Laden be responsible for the family accident, which included 394 people.
In the accident of the Great Mosquito, the body of 29 victims died on the streets.
In a group of the dead of Nosturi, Qasim Akram was home from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca for the first time.
Akram had been in Great Moscow with his parents, who were on their annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi-Arab authorities have agreed that hahjj will be held when thousands of people reach the best for the city for the holy liberation.
According to King Salman, the Binlad Group would not have been able to leave the nest tree above when it was not used.
According to an Arabic press release, the Binlad Group is a part of an accident.
However, according to the English report, the management of the group has refused to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what led to the fall of the tower at the foot of the Great Mosquito.
The Binladin Group has not published information on non-industrial safety, nor has the Group’s representatives been intended for the opinion.
The king also accused the Group of failing to comply with modern security regulations and working with meteorologists.
Five of us surrounded the Great Lakes of Mecca as part of the remaining building project of Binlad Group.
The Bin Laden family has been in close contact with the Saudi-Arab government for ten years, and Bin Ladens are in line with several important construction projects.
Al Qaida's former leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a nephew whose family had abandoned him in the 1990s.
The inevitability of nostalgia and severe wind occurred only a few days before the release of the Holy Mosque, which is the duty of every skilled Muslim to perform at least once during his lifetime.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities decided to pay a million interest (EUR 250 000) on victims' own and permanently displaced persons.
Other victims of accidents receive half the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q pomo, there is a poor Eastern European labour force
The British pay the house officials more and more than that, says Veronique Lauri.
The recommendations have been added by qualified, professional employers working from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix store designed for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, lead translator, Daily Mail
Brittany is said to be a home for leftovers and landfills to producers from Eastern Europe.
The left-hand side and the left-hand side are now very rare.
The British now hire more and more people at home to care for domestic nicotine, says B&Q's manager.
Veronique Lauri is a new supplier leader in Kingfisher, who owns a home for the sale of repair supplies. According to Lauren, there are professional workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at a very low cost.
As a result, Kingfisher is going to open 200 new, life-threatening Screwfix store. The same 60 B&Q store is closed.
Laurie wants more female strength in B&Q sales, as she is selling eight ten purchase decisions.
At this point, most of the staff are men.
According to Laurie, public trends are due, for today there is also a growing number of single women living in the home.
"Our salesman's staff is still a large part of the men," says Lauri.
"We must balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the product purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women have an important role to play in decision-making."
Lauri is one of five women who are following the British FTSE 100 index companies, and she has also reorganised the company's steering group so that both male and female leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only quality since 50 per cent of its staff are women, including the supplier's and financial manager.
"This was a known decision, the diversity is an important issue for us," said Laurie.
"It has not been difficult to find good women in the leadership group."
The kingfisher's half-year marketing and marketing permits are calculated, even though the company has carried out hard work following the closure of sales volumes.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q tickets and intends to open 200 new sales routes.
The three recent governments decided to secure the proposed legislation in order to save the economy of the country.
We've been able to see the effects quickly.
The head of the SAK and other pay agencies began to force the same way and, as a result, the country stands at home because of the wide range of workers.
A lot of people think there's a reason too.
Let's ask ourselves if we're wearing toys when it's going bad.
It's even based on counter-narcotics.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already been told that they are not going to participate in entertainment but are going to work.
This would have been impossible in an old age of good conscience.
Of course, there was nothing net where to protest, but openly declaring a crime would have been the political suicide of a small person.
Millions of professional organizations are protesting a few tens of thousands of people for less than a minute, but it gives the subject of thinking.
The position of the employment union is no longer as clear as it was decades ago.
Not all are aware of the objectives of the movement, values have changed
The solution of the government's interest in the operation of the Ay movement can also be seen as a real gift from heaven.
When things have appeared to be moving by their own weight, the latter will now be able to protect the rights of the worker, both clearly and properly.
The government may therefore wish to retain the role of the ay movement when membership in the professional union is seen to be more important in some areas.
Let's get rid of the activities of the organisations whatever they think, so it's time for us to get a little bit of interest to stop Finland.
Yes, Finland's been stopped for a while.
For example, industrial production has already been calculated 31 months later.
Gross product continues to decrease, and unemployment continues to rise.
You think these things force everyone's head.
A heavy savings period at the University of Lappeenrant: To achieve 8.5 million savings, staff is reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenrana will start a savings month with a total cost of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the university's savings, it will start telecommunications negotiations on the whole of its personnel, with an annual target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 workers.
In addition to two million other activities, there are efforts to save.
As a result of the YT negotiations, there is a budget for 2016 which foresees 8.5 million deficits.
This also affects the government's tariff restrictions.
In this respect, the university will produce about 2.6 million sub-funds.
The costs are rising slightly over the first year, but the funding received from the same ministry will fall by 2 million and the other by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about EUR 85 million, so the target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
It is very important for our university to be able to reduce the impact of cuts in massive teaching and research and to reduce the impact of business funding, says Rector Anneli Pauli of the University.
Before the end of the period, the effects of interruptions were even more milder, but now the reduction of additional funding appears in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trusted men shall be initiated first week in the week and shall continue for a fixed period of six weeks.
Top: Winnibus wants for Finnish railways
The owner of the railway company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter tells the general that the company is also heading for rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in moving to Finland's railway.
Stagecoach's company is one of Britain's biggest railway companies, Souter tells me.
Railway traffic is intended to be open to competition as soon as possible.
The first is the transport of the capital city from 2017 to 2018.
After the transit, you've got a long journey.
Souter's gonna tell you about the department of transport he's already near.
The Ministry of Transport considers the plans of Onnibus to be welcome.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Velia), which is so old as bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. Central Bank
The entire world is following the United States Central Bank meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, where it is decided on the possible rise of peaks for the first time in almost ten years.
The increase of half of the economics that were still believed by the central bank in recent weeks now to be less than 0 to 0.25 per cent of the central bank's current high-level. This is a question for the 80 economic scientists Reuters.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has been holding the crown for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can rise from zero to zero and thus start normalising high levels," said former researcher Angel Ubide of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The economic situation in the United States has been relatively good, and survival has brought to the level of billions of additional dollars and has only accelerated little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore the global situation which is not as serious as that.
It has invited markets to save for change, but also references to the contrary are available.
This Decision is to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union at 20 a.m.
Delta State University shooter left an apology card
After his girlfriend was shot on Monday morning in Mississippi, before a colleague shot at the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking for the first murder and hoping that she could get rid of it, the authorities told the lie.
At the University of Delta State, Mississpip called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday and he told the man that he was shooting.
Lamb asked the police to come home in an emergency.
He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is not a pity for anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell me.
And neither was Lamb told about the motive for the shooting.
The police arrived at the factory and found Amy Prentissin, 41, body and Lambin's letter, which read: "I am very sorry and I hope I can undo my work.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who's ever loved me."
After I wrote a letter, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed professor of history Ethan Schmidt before he killed himself after Monday when the police aimed at him.
The director of the university, William LaForge, said there was no known dispute between Lambin and Schmidt, but he admitted that Lambia was clearly in trouble.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb had reportedly believed that the Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities insisted that there was no information or evidence from the triangle.
I spent seven years with Prentissex at the marriage of Shawn O'Steen, who was born to be a good man for his wife.
Paris had been separated 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentis had a 19-year-old girl who's been raped.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of the press told Lindsay Knowles that Prentiss was working online all my hands.
Knowles said Prentiss had been accompanying Lambin for three years, and he also told a woman named Lighting.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called the family during the Mondays and told them he wasn't going to go to jail.
When the police aimed at Lambin Highway 1: near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, got off the road, ran into the forest and poured himself out.
According to the study list at the University’s website, Lamb received a PhD at Delta State University in the summer of 2015.

The last few years have been difficult for the performer (in the picture on his left son after Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett went to eat.

Everything that happened has really required their tax.
For two months on the page of the Manchester United Nations Luke Shaw
Luke Shaw's right foot broke into the Manchester United Masters' way against PSV Eindhoven.
The defendant has to stay on the side for at least half a year, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field this time.
At the age of 20, Shaw was injured in the PSV defense area in the bad tent of Héctor Moren when he was on his way for five minutes.
Shaw got an espresso in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before she could move to the hospital.
"Shaw has two broken legs and he's in the hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or tomorrow.
The 18-year-old man who joined the Manchester United River has experienced a severe stroke and now falls after the great plays.
They gave Shaw some sugar in their pockets.
A man.
I'm not a doctor, but when my leg breaks from two points, she's been on the side for half a month and she's not playing in the rest of the day.
I hope he'll be able to play this time.
Moreno was moved to a lower point when he did not follow a red card of punishment.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli is not a wealthy Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian court made a mistake.
"You may end up yourself, but I think your situation was worth a fine and a red card.
There was a two-way traffic jam."
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages. I can't describe how confused I am. My reaction starts with this and I'll be stronger."
More on: Manchester United Luke Shaw on the PSV file
The English defence has a particular reason to aim at the launch of the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad shock," said the PSV manufacturer.
"In such circumstances all the parties are always very sorry.
The aim of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his arm while playing in the Mexican front of Van Gaal's loan to the Netherlands only in 2014 World Championships.
"He's very sorry because he didn't intend to hurt the opponent. It's bad to hear that the wound is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation myself.
I saw only a ball that was going to the other side, so it seemed like he (Moreno) was touching the ball, but I didn't see Luke's shirt."
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult your situation may be," said Moreno to the SBS6 channel.
"It feels really bad. I'm so sorry."
The PSV Andrés Guardo was also placed in the hospital after the accident with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent will notice before long that the child learns his or her favorite book outside the closet.
Unless you saw David Cameron.
When the child welfare organization asked Cameroon to name the children's books, the Prime Minister elected Lorax, an environmental guide published by Dr. Seuss, in 1971.
On the SuperCampi website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, fun and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
It sounds good, except for the following point where Cameron is intended to describe the book in the past, is the clarification of the 2012 film version, which added new forms and details to supplement the short text.
"In the city of Tarville, whose real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is commercial, a son named Ted, who wants to escape his dream in the heart of Audrey by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see the right tree," says the text. In 1991 he died Dr. Seuss, Theodor Seuss Geisel, in the version of Tedil, had no idea of the beauty.
If this is not yet sufficient, Cameron's text is partly compatible with the Internet Movie Database on the Lorax screen. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where all are methods and even the air is commercial, a boy named Ted who wants to get his daughter's dream into Audrey's heart."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book would be so close to him. Ahne Kerskanen will destroy the trees and prepare them for the needs of the nominee Lorax's resistance. Lorax is a small and fat, a weekly creature that protects forests.
Likely like this, the small p-action is considered to be an assistant's duty, apparently for someone who has not read Loraxa 20 times in the pocket.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the text would probably be from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this more precisely, but confirmed that the text was the staff of Cameron.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still rare.
Pakistan's presence in the United Arab Emirates is a rare task, but it is not expected to repeat the deaths of the last 3-0 Test series on the English tour.
I wouldn't have shut down a visitor's opportunity.
Alastair Cook may be less experienced than a three-year team, but there are good players in the sound team and a strong team position – they have no bad experiences since 2012, only a young positive one.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a cycle player, and Adil Rashid, although he does not have a test level experience, represents an attack alternative.
Subject: Adam Lyth fallen from the English Test Group and replaced by Alex Halles
The decision to leave Adam Lyth away is obviously difficult for me to understand as his prime minister in Yorkshire.
His seven witnesses have had two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and clear truth is that the players are judged according to results.
For example, Joe Root is not a question-of-the-art choice because – as I said earlier – players are the best choices.
A few 50-point rounds would have been held by Lythin's team, but his destiny was in his own hands.
Hopefully he'll get a new chance when he hit Yorkshire with more runs.
The English prime minister, Trevor Bayliss, asked him to be installed too when he didn't do as well as he could, which didn't surprise me. He's first of all a team player.
The question of how long tests may have an opportunity to make their impact is difficult.
Lyth got seven landings – like his predecessor Sam Robson – when Nick Compton got nine again.
Only Compton got a chance at home and a visit.
The only question of vote may be that England used Jonathan Trotti first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in high school – but this last chance is now history.
Alex Hales is coming into the group and he's the ones I value at the top.
He's an unknown author's cricket player, which we saw in Yorkshire this time when he made 236 points against us at the Trent Bridge.
He must have at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates.
Without the thought that Moen will start with Cook, where there will be an extra roundabout game at the same time as four long-term players are held, and I am not against the idea.
I don't see a ban on the fact that the top player could be shooting at this, and this left-hand player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moene may not have gotten much in his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a team player, and it's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test course as the first substitute player before he got started in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't come back.
Zafar Ansari is in the group as a stock exchanger, and on the basis of what I have seen from him, she has proved to be a very influential young man.
People can see his statistics – on average 31 points per night and 35 hits – and this can be a search engine, but very many bikers have not shown themselves ready, and voters have decided to take a young player.
He learned a lot during this accident.
Out of the play team, England will be able to make a couple of wise choices about their training staff.
The appointment of Siri Lanka's striker, Mahela Jayowarden, as the consultant of the Test Treatments can be transient.
This is one of the most noble men who have a lot of experience because he has played in all kinds of circumstances and attacks.
Paul Collingwood becomes part of a white ball of film and includes both energy and lovelessness.
I think he has always influenced an appropriate international cricket, whether his role is a player or a producer, and Mahela’s way of doing this should be of use to him.
Sometimes a new voice in the kitchen, even though it would say the same thing as before, can be a little rusty.
Collyn's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been released in one day's interview, Root has had the same opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not all agree, manufacturers and voters do not set a schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that the way players do their jobs depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's half-year-old renegotiation strategy for staying in Britain in the EU is still in the far deeper favor of the day, even without pleased Jeremy "yes or no" Corbynia's choice of a working party or of a highly competitive Europe.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragen.
The European diplomat recently explained how in many crises the EU is going through – although not all of them are doing their own thing – part of the Member States have failed to take part in the British's own agenda, which includes the allocations due to discrimination and the amendments to the Treaty of Creation which they do not even want.
At the annual TUC conference in Brighton, they decided that they would not be upset in the EU if they were concerned about social security.
We could even call it Daven and George's selfish agenda.
At summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, the Prime Minister and the Associates are excited to take the picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-value persons, return home and repeat the changes they have made.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be in the European Union as an open-minded British. "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin, and proposes that the Minister and the official in various capitals have come to the point that it is no longer important whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a reasonable member of the association that Germany is considering is a member of the association, but has been in force for ten years and wants to leave the office before it leaves, as he visited those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a new choice or a subsequent choice in 2017.
He's got a lot of power.
There can soon be a nationalist administration, again in Spain.
It is difficult to imagine them in calling for self-helps that could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom. They do not want it either, because most of them have separatist events.
Some of these ministers may plan to avoid unnecessary comments in the style of Scotland’s national party in the 2017 United Kingdom’s national campaign to force Brexit’s process to be proposed by my friend.
"Renewal negotiations had been arranged." "British won't have anything to do with the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how the British press is doing and how the EU-Special Olympics are, just as Tony Benn's 1975 vote, which resulted in a 2.1 EU accession in 1973.
In some cases, it is recalled that Boris Johnson, a Euro-porter, who became known as "our direct exchange of letters of bananas in the EU" in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
Ed Miliband knew at least his enemies.
These include taxes, telephone hackers, and sightings, which are owned by most of our speakers.
Actually, Tony Blair was thinking a lot of the same things about them, but then you realized that when he's in the heat with a mountain gorilla, he's got to get bananas for a while so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for lunch and a day.
Miliband was the most liberal of Blairia's opposition to the referendum, and Blair was granted EU constitutions which were then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in 2005 at the national vote, Blair reached a very high level.
The paper never gave him anything to forgive.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who beat me up friendlyly on the Westminster Monday, I told him that he no longer has time to shoot me. It could be dangerous that he's taking Neil Kinnock's 80th-century media biotic strategy. It was wrong and still.
It may take time, but Corbyn has to develop a consistent strategy with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, who's a BBC shooter he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we call an effective implementation.
He says he wants to keep us reformed in the EU.
Most of Ukipi and Tory's outsiders can probably respond positively to this.
That's when Hilary "Benn but Benniitt" told Ben on radio and on television this week when his in-law tried not to admit that there was a bad river from Corbyn to call Karski John McDonnell's Secretary of State.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had difficulty watching TV a suspect in the labour side colleges without going too far and without losing his place in his basement.
The difficulties of Hillary were more interesting.
Benn said that he was responsible for leaving the EU "in all circumstances". McDonnel did not say so and not to Corby's colleagues and subordinates on Monday evenings.
If Corby wanted to focus on any great picture, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The newsmagazine is important at 24/7, especially in social media crime, where paranoia and fraud are associated.
Cameron does not need to give EU-wide freedom of movement, which would make it possible for him to support Labour in his own national vote, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins is at least aware of this.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equation of EU membership was attributed to the past of the island economy and capitalism.The discussions are no longer just part of the summit's left-wing left-wing thinkers, whose idea of unity is central to learning in doctrinal cuisine.
The equation has also been seen for Naton. Tom Watson is unreasonably not campaigning for Corbyn's departure. Foreign diplomats must try to clarify their home affairs.
Why should Paris or Berlin be fired from political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they grant grants to Britain when everything can be free?
The United States has already been misled by the harsh military performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the early days of the Tory administration. I received this reminder on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticised British opinions on e-mail
According to the researchers, the State-funded agency’s claim that the burning of electricity supplies is 95 per cent less fatal than traditional smoking was born at a meeting involving 12 participants in the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the report on public health in England (PHE).
PHE described his report last month as "for translation and comprehensive review of results".
However, many researchers have questioned the safety of the data and have raised the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Lancet Medical Journal’s main work included the last month’s "very good foundation" on which PHE’s most important conclusion was based.
In addition, two researchers have been based on BMJ, whether the claims are based on "the rock or the rock".
Professor Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medical European Public Health Care and Professor Simon Capewell of Liverpool University of Clinical Epidemiology stated: "The basis for public health care is that the principles of action are based on a clear indication of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the PHE's claim that "the most accurate estimate of electricity consumption is about 95% less hazardous than traditional wastes" should be based on a detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
You can get together from a single 12-person meeting called at school for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) to develop a model based on analysis. The model wanted to bring together the views of participants on the benefits of nicotine products. The results were compiled for research.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the support for the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which was funded by the former independent director of the supply chain (BAT) according to sources.
In addition, the supplier's report showed support for the activities of the Sustainable Activity in accordance with the public health of the BAT.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting, however, had not been granted by Philip Morris International, a former co-financed company.
However, there are a number of well-known supporters of electronics who share their participation as a fund of industry.
However, a number of participants are not aware of their expertise in combating smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's smoker.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no clear indication of the dangers of products in terms of their scope and compliance with their criteria.
However, complaints or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there has been no indication that electricity can promote smoking for children or non-smoking. McKee and Capewell are considered to be early.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, the director responsible for PHE's health and well-being has been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electricity is much less dangerous than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smoked through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks of electronics are lower than the risks of traditional smoking. However, the long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens what the appearance shows and what it does not indicate, especially in a situation where the relative risks to traditional tobacco are as unclear as they are.
In the United Kingdom, there is a death rate of nearly 80,000 cigarettes per year, and smoking is responsible for public health costs of two billion pounds per year.
The responsible action requires that we clearly present this present phenomenon, which does not suggest that electricity supply is an alternative to risk, but the damage caused by it is part of the damage caused by traditional smoking.
BBC should get rid of East Enders, says Channel 4 bomb.
Channel 4: Luke Johnson has found that BBC should stop sending certain programs. These include East Enders and The Voice.
According to Johnson, license fees should only be used for programmes that other television stations do not.
He was critical of the fact that BBC is likely to be less likely to present programmes to the public at the same time with large audience programmes for competitors, such as the BBC4 channel.
When BBC President Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase its cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried to get channel 4 cooperation with BBC for six years.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC buys formats and sends programmes that were clearly part of a competitive channel," Johnson told Parliament's top office committee, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a general radio tax which I do not think is necessary for a medium or long term good idea, it should be accompanied by at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voice to the best time of viewing because it wants as much support as possible in the future.
If any other channel doesn't care about the program, it's obviously a drawable shell.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be financed without support," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, the East Enders second, even though it's its own production.
A lot of cannons would give it to her right hand.
I don't understand how this serves the general radio company's service.
I don't think these would have been a loss to BBC."
Johnson is a serialist who was leading Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He believes BBC has acquired good vision skills because it works with respectable people and because they believe it is the best way to secure long-term support.
Johnson’s comments on BBC’s most popular series are similar to that of former Sky-Pomon Tony Ballin, who proposed in 2003 MacTaggart’s report that BBC would remove such lines as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, BBC's Niche-Yellow programs are shown in the BBC4 channel, where viewers cannot often measure, but they meet their purpose. "BBC can say in defense of tecopy missions by making four billion-billion-pound general radio payments to special programs that no one has ever seen."
"BBC presents them as a time when no one will ever see them."
Johnson said: "I ask you to look for another old-fashioned system that will benefit the best.
Of course everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is a good one, but the people for whom it's a big amount, especially if it doesn't look at BBC."
Former Sky and Channel 5 channel leader David Elstein, who also shared his views in the committee as a youth, said that BBC should change its old mission into new "information, learning and pleasure".
According to Elstein, there are also educational programmes in BBC's current supply – 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio. He adds that BBC should learn about Australian and Canada's public radio companies and pursue its mission in the new faith: "information, light and entertainment".
In Elstein's cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that BBC could add copies of events such as the Proms festival, which was sent to concerts last year only part of the breakdown. "The BBC should also be connected to its trade channels so that the entire supply is also available on the network", he continues.
Headphones can be controlled by sound systems using sonogenetic
The video shows how unhindered it changes its direction when it is hit by an ultrasound.
Researchers have grown muscles that have been genetically modified by the brain system, which can be guided by ultrasound.
The small particles change their direction when they are hit by an ultrasound that is at the top of the human ear.
The speakers activated traffic jams that are genetically modified so that they have a transport valve that reacts to ultrasound.
More on: Researchers follow brain activity by means of light
According to researchers, the monkeys were used to show the effect of a new somnolence method (dubbed sonogenetics). The procedure uses ultrasound to activate the brain, heart and body muscles from outside the body in the future.
In California, Salk Institute researcher Sreekanth Chalasani told the Guardian that one day the method can be used to compensate for brain neurostimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms, where brains are stimulated by electronic pulses.
But my chalasins don't usually react to ultrasound. I noticed, however, that the monkeys start reacting when they are placed into a nest with a small microscopic shell.
Chalasan says that the shells form ultrasounds that progress into the soil.
The confirmed ultrasounds affect TRP4-ionic acids, which are part of the soil cells.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, these ionized voices will be able to open and activate the cells to which they have been attached.
In order to guide the ovarians across the outer Chalasan mussel genetically, some of their leading brains appeared as TRP4 ionacans.
When turned over the surface of the ground, the microphones strengthened the sound waves and moved into the ground where the signal was moving in the hermos.
The procedure reminds us of a little optogenetics, which is a soft tool that allows researchers to activate brain cells using light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brains of the study by the eyes of those who are alert. The measurement times are exceeded by the passing life, so that the ultrasound can be directed through the brain through the neck.
"We believe that with the help of gene therapy and virus treatment, human brain cells can be temporarily exposed to ultra-navigated signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasan noted.
According to the researchers, the method could also be used in meat cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unpaved Stings — Your Home!
The statements are embarrassing for the British army
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arm video.
You're a terrible killer!
Nilkko's fucking legcart!
We're gonna blow up!
Avoiders who cause indiscretion but don't leave behind!
A happy voice and cross-platforms clearly show that this famous world's largest position is parody. Video is Amnesty International's production, and it is intended to create a British government's attempt to sell weapons to security and defence management DSEI (Defendity Security and Equipment International), which is organized in the ExCel Measuring Centre located in London Docklands.

The bus stop and the metro vehicle also blow up the newspapers requiring a second blow.
"Relevant announcement: is it moving by metro 15-18.9?" The announcement reminds you of the announcements of the London Metro. On the other side of the metroline there is also a picture of tankers.
"In September a lot of arms contracts will be reached in Docklands. Customers will be asked for help in order to stop their positions."
Three-thirds of the publication has been made by artists whose work was presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Design.
On behalf of the Conciliation Special Patrol Group helped in the press department around London with a six-pound "pocket of the mining hacker" which, according to the claim, has six schools with about a third of the world's bus stop advertising equipment.

According to Rubel Design's curator and lecturer at Essex University, artists have started asking questions and want to bring their political work to the public to see the gallery outside.
Artists have noted that social impact through art requires that art is introduced into the real world. Many also move to work with the activists of protest movements.
Another of the anti-trafficking advertisings welcomes public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times during the day. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both graphic designers and sometimes have done their work without compensation.
VCCP's artistic director Matt Lever took the lead in removing the mine from the mine and emptying it in the ExCeL's event calendar. He said, "Let's give them campaigns they're trying to avoid."
They tried to weaken a more realistic, horizontal business video, but the colors and animation of the church reflect better attention."
"They have done a great job and have helped us to raise the fairs where the factory is being used for the entertainment trade," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that the arrests are not traded directly in our home country."
However, in ExCeLi's own exhibition tables, where exhibitors use soft bicycles for commercial purposes, they are given.
In its press release, the U.S. has been informed of the situation of the US Army with regard to "a positive AT4CS RS."

It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules in student housing
I changed the school board 11 years ago. I was 19 years old and still believed in ballet and moral relativism. From now on, I remember the powerful smiles I had generated, and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons I can draw from eight simple rules.
The change in the accommodation must be the most difficult experience and the most devastating.
In the situation, it's easy to start with years: tell everyone what you're doing, what you like about the middle of the year and why you like Corbyn and why you don't really hate or love Marmite, because it's just a shame, ahhhhhhhhah, I'm in my room."
Take a breath between you and me.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other questions.
Questions lead to discussions and help you to find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your tapes were on the screen and these people would share the puzzles.
Give others room.
Their rooms often operate as lunchrooms, movie theaters and general living quarters, but their rooms also have a place where they are dressed, from the start.
More on: Don’t even imagine your partner’s follow-up and university education
The University of Introverts has a hard place
However, in many homes there is a social culture that prevents the room from falling apart and forms lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be oppressive to a person who needs a place of return.
In this environment it is not possible to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I used to spy on you."
Try to find out if any of your student blood is involved in socializing. Kentis should be able to keep it out of the door and send a text message instead.
I mean, I'm talking about getting together.
In my own student residence there was a kind of one that I didn't think meant that he was in.
He saw everything.
Get your friends on the tape.
You start your study properly when it's in, so if you find some brownies and dig up some door to look like a 50-year-old, a little weird in case: "Come to the neighborhood, I'll find you something small.
The housekeepers are a great way to get new friends.
Your teacher's blood is going to have to talk to you, and because of the surprise of the teacher, they can have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires you to be reasonable in your expectations.
If you offer unsatisfied chocolates of cold, sugar and fat, others will probably make their sleep when you go to the door.
Feeding is also common in student hospitals.
It is of course stealing from another side, but can it cover a hole from another dairy business?
Always make sure you own a milk product.
You'll probably get permission, even if the loan of milk would turn into a job owner.
I understand very well that it is embarrassing if someone can help you. Still try to treat your situation as mature as possible — unlike my own school nurse who has given up her milk as a punishment for farmers.
She's in jail now.
Don't act like someone else's trying to sleep or hang out.
Not only because it's a treat, but also because it's a reminder that anyone who's going to get hurt...
In my own apartment, one girl asked a neighbor to set up a music show in a smaller room, since it was three in the morning, and she had an appointment in the morning.
You're only about to increase your volume.
When I was late in the next room, she gave me a two-hour nap. She went three hours to try, left music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future partner had been affected by moving into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your student blood would be on your side, that you'd start dating, get separated, and have to see her every day and lose your common friend's right to meet her?
If the student student doesn't really think it's the only right thing to do, try to stop him.
If you notice as a decisive moment that someone has forgotten to open a room that has not been closed, the limit of competition and temptation is more confusing than you might think.
A good game is fun, but it's the one that's coming up for a moment.
Hideting some material can be valuable and enjoyable teaching, but no one in the room should wear a ring and a ring.
The door of the other room can lock and drop the doors into the watery waters that place the trash, but don't care about any of the goods on the roof with a blue tart twice more.
The house of foreign students was demolished in Salo - The house designed for the reception centre
In the morning, a racist meeting was held at the home of foreign explorers in Kitel North Karrilla.
As the police told me earlier, there are no housing statistics for former asylum seekers but more than ever the sleeping rooms of foreign residents in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the People's Republic of China.
The doors and walls of the National Church's housing styles were torn apart by heavy marks, such as openings, and one of the doors of one apartment windows had been ripped off by a metal display, says the police of East Finland.
According to Luukkas, who works as a social educator for young people in the National Church, the focus of the building was estimated at ten people during the school term.
"It was a weekend and adult people were free to move, so part of it could be different," Luukian says.
The National Park has hosted people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland for some time former students and only minor asylum seekers.
All of the buildings in the building are a-state.
Part of the adult education school, part of the vocational education and part of the study in Finland", Loukain says.
The status A has been so stated as a continuing residence permit which can be granted for four years once in Finland for a time to be a foreigner.
The East-Suomen police were investigating the father as an accident and a home crime.
According to the class, the students were considered to have been informed on Monday, where they also had the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," Luukian says.
According to the team, they've already been wiped out of the wall.
In fact, there were at least three men who were suspected of being trafficked in a car.
I think this is the main point of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
There's nothing more serious about it," Loukain says.
There is also a hospital in Salo which is designed for reception center.
The incident happened last week.
The MTV told me about it on its website on Tuesday morning.
The hospital wall was limited to the opening room and written in English "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected policy assumptions regarding the age and status of people living in the building.
The government will stop Y-juna Karjaall - passengers in their dreams, "I think I'm an idiot"
The Y-jun of the Helsing Raasepor Karjaal will stop going in March.
The news highlighted the passengers rising to the beginning of the journey at Helsinki headquarters.
In particular, the basement runs down to the sandy beaches, says Torbjörn Bengtström, in the village.
Idiotization is precisely because the amount of housing is growing all the time and work requires rapid and smooth contact with Helsinki.
This can't be anything other than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström says in HSTV's challenge video he's coming even on a tractor to the capital.
Other changes also take place in New Zealand.
The H-and-R-Jones shall be combined into the new R line.
The location of the powder in Järven and Nuppulna Tuusula will be removed from use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR have published in detail information on the means by which the Ministry will purchase railway transport under the following contract.
The contract box is changing over the year and the stopping lines are all over the country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded at the end of the year shall be adopted by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
The Bengtström Senate considers the state's power plant to be short-lived.
The same mistakes have been made in the past and will be repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be cover.
The Y-ray also uses other than Russian and Sintian because it is fast and ends many positions.
Anna Pöyry, who lives in Espoo, was troubled by the distance between the city area and the destination.
"It's a crime for those who have to plan their trip again," he said in the spring of Y-Y.
It's a little easier. It's a promise.
There will be a new link between the coastal region, which will replace the South Helsing region (HSL), which will extend to the Kirkkonum.
This will increase the costs of HSL, i.e., in practice for the customs and taxpayers of the region.
"We are now addressing different options and their impact on service and lipping prices," HSL supplier Suvi Rihnemi said.
It is still impossible to assess costs carefully.
The Board of Directors says that the HSL based on the number of passengers has paid out of the Y line for a million years, the Ministry has much more to do with this.
The next R line will be between two positions.
Instead, the number of seeds in Ainolas and Saunakallio doubles.
The entire country will end up with 28 small stations and numerous roads.
The Ministry no longer buys trucks from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurau and Jyväsky-Haapämäki-Seinäjöki.
The long line of Joensu is reduced to the short line of the long line of the long line.
The season is reduced by the coast of Rihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Katka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
There are over half a million trips per year during which the total purchase of travel by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the country.
The value of the contract is about EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixteen Korkman wrote in his book The Time of the Chapter: "Marxian Supports Family"
The global economic crisis has been raised on the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and in 1867-1894, published in 1894 by the Head of State, writes as former president of the SKP, Yrjö Hakanen in his book today published on the date of the capital of Marx.
"They are now taken more seriously than they have been for a long time," Hakan wrote in his president's office.
Marx's evaluation of capitalist economic development, internationalization and improvement in all areas of life, focusing on capital and the growing role of capital and imagined capital have proved to be a surprising challenge.
A book writer based on the main seminars is also found by Professor of Aalto University, respected economic operator Sixten Korkman.
In the book of Korkman writes that Marx is a contemporary "now and forever".
However, is not the former director of the Research Institute for Life and the delegation of Life is a Marxian?
I don't think so.
The High Commissioner will tell me on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a temporary economic operator but rather an interesting social theory.
Social data are now unique and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and writer.
"The common view is that the Atheism tells us of the wrong ideas of dead men," Korkman began.
It's true that Marx's predictions went very well.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial government, he drew too much conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, the foundation of the Korkman.
However, Korkman sees the value of being placed in Marx radically.
"The most important thing in Marx is that she asked good questions," she says.
We are now again discussing Marxin's interests, such as the sharing of stock.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a great picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical comfort," Corkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful for Marx.
In his view, capitalism was an unexpected case that should just end.
Still, Marx is supportive of Korkman's family.
"In the '70s Marxia couldn't read," Korkman says.
"The Maulians and Trotskys and other gods hated all capitalism, but more than anything else."
Today's debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also draw closer without the ideology and political pressure of the years.
"Every sociologist should get to know Marx's thinking world - like other classes," Korkman says.
UN requires military court in Sri Lanka
The United Nations requires the establishment of a special court to investigate military operations carried out in Sri Lanka, says AFP.
The United Nations report on the use of inland war in 1983-2009 appeared on the average after a long break.
The report charges the military forces of Sri Lanka, as well as the military commanders known as the Tamils.
The content of Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no specific information about the number of victims.
In particular, in the last month of the war in 2009, the major armed forces should be carefully investigated, as required by the UN report.
The report of the Sri Lankan forces accused of torture, rape and systematic sexual violence, which was likely equal to that of men and women.
According to the report, the capitals have been accused of impeaching civilians and children.
Both parties have been accused of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was going to conduct an investigation itself, but it is not going to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In English yo-coke, social media has been scored
In the middle of the week, there was a long visitor to the English language of the empire.
Over 16,000 cococs were tested by English artists.
In the test, you may even write the material on social media.
On the basis of their own experience, we need to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-English dictionary could be used to show the content of the Web site.
The search was Dear Agony Count.
Agony Aunt will respond from Finland to Leelan's pleasure.
He came to ask for advice on how parents should view matters for young people as well.
There were four of them to choose one of them.
"It was the hardest of these," considered the third issue of Porvoo's English-language reader Mia Lybeck.
On the third point, only the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barrosol, was quoted.
The fourth theme was very nice for Lybeck.
It was supposed to write down why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been used to write books," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experience "almost normal".
In an English or Swedish experience, for example, questions were answered about texts that dealt with adaptation to climate change and the treatment of large data files.
In the middle of the week, some of the blood was also written in Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The registrations of the complaint continue as a family day, when there is a second home, or Swedish or Finnish examination.
In Luke the tests are normally arranged, i.e. the opinion of the employers is not affected.
The University of applied sciences invites students to seek suitable travel connections in time so that they will be able to cope with the trial.
Further time can be obtained if it can be shown that delay has not been caused by its own indifference.
Trade in arms was stolen in the valley
In Oulu, trade was stolen on Wednesday morning in the city center of Kello.
According to the police, thieves had been dressed in dark clothes and grown on the command line.
He's a normal guy, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with this and had received a small amount of money from the local government.
Let's look into the matter as a robbery.
Police will ensure that tens of thousands of stakeholders are reached in Helsinki - other support parties from Finland
The government's decision-making will be supported by the police during the spring of the Helsinki debate.
The site is home to tens of thousands of people.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTK associations will meet at 11.00 a.m. on the Railway Station.
The police are also believed to be involved in prejudice.
In addition to taking care of alerts and other police activities, it is also the responsibility of the police in the workplace to ensure that there is no shortage of asylum.
Roads leading to the railways are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 a.m. to 14 p.m.
Only vehicles are rescued in the area.
From the direction of the starting point, the movement will be cut off from the direction of the bow of the bow of the Emperor, from the west direction from the direction of the Mannerheims.
Is there enough people in Helsinki's police station, Colonel Seppo Kujala?
Second, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand for the police.
According to Kujala, Helsinki has received support from other parties from Finland because of its strong interest.
The police don't tell us the exact number of parties.
"Some kind of error is coming, but we're essentially going to do our own thing," Kuvala says.
The police are calling for a private vehicle to be avoided in central Helsinki on Friday.
The picture estimates that the worst traffic surplus is rising from Hakan's level to the nuclear power plant.
Permanent transport is expected from the beginning of the morning.
On the other hand, there are a lot of discounts in Helsinki due to the interested parties from Finland.
They're not being rescued from the Railway.
The buses are going to be on time.
Then you'll have to go to the place of opinion," the picture tells you.
I would also like to stop the group traffic in Helsing.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side here.
The problem of traffic flexibility, which is normally addressed at these large gatherings, is now part of itself.
The media have told the police that there may be tens of thousands of opposition to the economic policy of the government in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for a peace of mind.
There are few ordinary people who are employed or unemployed.
The Finnishs are reasonable and peaceful people," the picture is true.
In different parts of Finland, local entertainment is also organised on Fridays.
As a matter of fact, in many ways it's extraordinary. Do you remember these laws and sentiments?
In many ways, it is interesting and extraordinary to organize a great deal of interest in the course of the trade unions.
For example, there is no very good comparison between Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskyl.
There's no wonder the ay movement protested.
If it hadn't done so, it would have raised its hands in front of the government, Sisian says.
A very fair government has been committed to the traditional nuclear power of Finnish corporateism - as well as to points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare government.
There is no right to contract.
There are a lot of barriers here to the fact that ay-trafficking is really trying to get a gun.
At the same time, the ay movement has a place to look at the hidden.
For example, there is a need for shelters because the ay-transport does not necessarily have the support of all employers in terms of income.
Now there is a new set of ideas that will be given at the time of a group that would like to take part in an opinion.
On the other hand, the unemployed who met in Finland showed their opinion at the parliamentary hearing in November 1993.
If at the end of the day it was looking for a comparison, it could be a statement of resignation from the unemployed, Murrostorstai, which was organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deep lake, Murrostorta gathered 20,000 workers.
The government of Esko Ahon (meaning) co-operated from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that there had never been any worse between the Finnish Government and the employers' organisations than during the Aho Conservative Management.
Now, there may be even worse between the government and the ay movement than in the days of Murrostorsta.
In addition to this, there is now a very poor government in Finland, Sisijänen says.
The current government coalition is still interested in the way that it is so much more just than the basic Finnish language.
There were some elements of the old work force in the course of the earthquake.
The site is expected to be filled with thousands of fans every spring.
It also stops public transport and possibly closes day-to-days and schools.
Although interest may not be shared by employers, it can be seen as a great deal of years.
In Helsinki some 300 opinions have been held every year in recent years.
They're on deck.
Traditionally, the views of the Finnish ay movement have been very peaceful - although they have been active in recent years.
The Finnish opinion usually avoids conflict, being legalists.
Interested parties are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisijänen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of entertainment has changed.
EU membership encouraged farmers to throw out the cannons and the police managed to get on top of the net.
For three months, in 1998 the number of firemen was three months old.
Showable bats were also included by planes and pilots.
Do you remember these pictures and comments?
Metal and electricity from the 1970s
The most important laws of the 1970s were metal saws in 1971 and power and electricity in 1977.
There were 70,000 metals involved in metal casting.
The decision was interrupted by a presentation by the Conciliation Board for seven weeks.
The metallics got 16 percent payoffs.
In the summer of 1977, the electric current lasted for 49 days and caused electrical tests around the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to express their opinion on employment.
The Palomen took refuge in three months in 1998
The palace wall was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless I was a state wall.
Farmers opposed the EU from 1994 and 1999
The police had to fight against farmers' protests against the EU in 1994.
"Sieria teaches, the EU stops," one of the students said.
The farmers in Spain had a lot of tonne.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also gave farmers the opportunity to protest and burn candles in front of the meeting place.
Lawyers were registered in 1983 and 1995
In 1995, hospital carers took about a month’s rent.
Last time they were in law in 1983.
In 1995, several deaths occurred during the strike.
Do your threat by law and by team carding of the caregivers in 2007.
The negotiations were finalised on the threat of group carding.
Doctors lactating 2001
"Doctors in law - tax," belonged to the School of Lawyers in 2001.
The number of medical clinics and hospital doctors continued for a five-month period and in time was discussed in detail how the doctors could endanger the safety of patients.
After the fall, the public sector paid doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students were taught March by the Senate in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Police will solve the refugees in full with the results of the Finnish police in Austria
The Austrian police have asked the central police to help find out the consequences of registered refugee violence in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Asterheim near the border of Germany with 42 refugees.
There's no idea if the river was on its way to Finland.
All those who were in the basement were all right.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and responsibility are at an event site in Eastern Austria, says the Chief of Central Policy, Colonel Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, it became more and more urgent for other passengers traveling by truck in Austria.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died of apparent support.
According to the General Council, the river belongs to the Finnish private company.
The company operates, inter alia, the food industry and its supplier is an alien, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested for human trafficking in East Austria.
My long-distance captain, former drug dealer and senior businessman - the story of the five secret transporter
The king of the proud secretaries, the violent Russians, the tyly informant of the shipment, and the taxi to remain in good faith.
For example, such people practice human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminal at the University of Trent, and the supplier Giampaolo Musumec, have met and challenged dozens of secretaries and these "clients" and, by writing their letter, the Death Travel Office will appear in Finland this week.
In the book they present the links of human transport, they present solutions and they present secretaries from various business portals.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
In the east coast of Tunisia, the villages are not attracting foreign tourists, but many Tunisian people are heading for the Middle East.
Because of its location, the islands are also particularly suitable for secret transport, since the trip to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 miles [120 km].
Because of the comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, El Attaya's uncle lives in Emir, my boss burned down and my six-year-old father.
The small-scale vessels are famous for their shellfish, but the fishermen are more productive than they can transport people.
It's been done by Emir in a blue, ten-foot tree hundreds of times.
If the ocean is full, it'll take 40 people.
On one trip, Emir will travel around EUR 8 000 after costs.
Emily's got five of her clients looking for her around Tunisia.
Customers reach many countries, but during the Arab era, a large number of Tunisian people wanted to leave their homes.
After that, the situation was calmed until the refugee crisis was over again.
Customers are getting from manter to Kerkenna-sara in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food will be given so that customers will just stay alive.
The housing pays about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer ends up in the middle, it is their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night.
The first night is taken away from the islands, then stopped, waiting for the day and going to Lampedus the next night.
Sometimes it's hard to sail, and in the mountains of 20 meters, passengers cry and cry.
As a matter of fact, the human race has been evacuated for half an hour and Emir is leaving for the airport.
Emir wants us to be afraid of him.
That's why he's slowing down his client and at least claiming to be a layman.
He says in the letter that when the police chased him once, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to flee to the nearest island.
"I took customers individually from the basement and threw them overboard," says Emir in his book.
The most peaceful travelers will come from south of Sahara.
He's got to listen to this.
I'll get rid of them right away.
They need to show them who's here.
Very common cab
Goran is just a regular taxi in Bogovad in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the start engine is finally running and, of course, it's seen the best day of its life.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving over and it's moving towards the border of Hungary.
Bogotá is located some 500 miles [60 km] from Belgrade on the beach.
Nearly there is a centre for asylum seekers where families are usually rescued.
In the middle of the forest, without family travel men are housed in buildings, ships and abandoned cars, which have now succeeded in finding or building.
Also in the forest are families who have not left their asylum application in Serbia for reasons or for other reasons.
Some also live in private homes, but it's a public secret.
A group of foresters Goran will find most of their customers.
These are often the last ones - through the Balkans the road requires a large number of crossings and weekly trips in difficult lands, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When we finally reach the Bogovad region, where there is great human trafficking, people are dying.
The Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians. He's telling us in the book.
"They say their business once and it's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying hard.
Goran doesn't like it.
You're gonna have to keep your head on the whole trip.
For example, EUR 300 is agreed for the first time, then they will be reduced to EUR 200 and will finally offer 150.
Goran claims to be a nice and kind man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," she says in her book.
Gora will tell her to work less than others and to count her requests to the border of Hungary for only EUR 50.
The trip is three hundred miles away, most of which is fine with motorcycling.
Members will ask for a hearing at a price of three or four.
It's worth about €50,000 a year.
It is not a large amount for the transporter, but in Serbia it is a very nice income.
Serbia has determined that the taxis cannot transport transferable persons 12 kilometers closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and schools and takes his client's mile from the border.
Then he'll show the customers the right direction and get away.
On-the-job
For 35-year-old Congoleses, it's called a Messenger, and it's not just a nice name.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers in Congo, as well as a small centre where help is given to Congolese children.
In addition to preaching the message, the Ambassador is driving a bus that moves people from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a job of cheating.
It's important for the transmission channel to look good.
He will dress his clothes many times a day and be careful that the white shirts of his pants are made of silk satisfactorily over the bottom of his shirt.
The station is high on the new Mercedes, on the farm, and on three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he arranges for people from Congo to Uganda and to Europe.
The client will start calling any of the five telephone numbers of the Messenger.
He suggests that the border be on track in the morning, hide the money in sight and cross the border with traveling merchants.
In order to obtain the asylum seeker's or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are home for example in the war zones of the North Kivun and that they have had to leave their homes with violence.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, the Messenger will arrange for the client to have a new identity.
An old personal certificate will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It's where I'm gonna get the contact from the embassy in Ugandan police.
After this, the client will be guided to the same place where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum application procedure, the creation of civil organisations, at the end of the UNHCR.
The postman is aware of bureaucracy because he has become a refugee in Uganda.
He calculates each step separately: leaving an application to the Ugandan police will pay about a hundred euros, processing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and changing the process, for example, EUR 4,500-7 000 in one European country.
Follies and ice cream
Tom's got to start a secret transporter. He's a former drug dealer.
A four-year-old Irish daily on the French coast of Calais, where his work is to bring people to the streets on the way to Britain.
He has an Afgianian, French taxi in London, as well as ten rockets that don't even know he's on a passenger bus.
At night Tom and his cab were touching his client, usually 2-3 people, something I'm talking about from Calais.
They're driving the engine A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on a motor vehicle, Tom and the driver would have to arrange an illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it. He's been sitting there for seven years for drugs.
To stop the taxi, Tom runs over the customer's motorbike to the restroom where the kittens sleep before the canal boy goes to Brittany.
Tom's choosing the right team. It's gotta be sure it's on its way to England and not even to the Netherlands.
It's got to be quiet so that the cucumbers can wake up.
Sometimes someone's in the mood, but then the smell is the most expensive.
When the road is clear, Tom turns his client into an aluminium foil, the same as that in the kitchen it turns around a past or a novelty.
It should prevent the police from detecting any secretaries.
Some use the same payroll for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client alone and leaves the hope that no one will stop the conquistadores until Britain.
King of the Salaculators
Muammer Küčik is one of the world's most famous human artists.
The Turkish people of Ukraine have been called the master of the market and the determined king of illegal exchanges in the Mediterranean, which manages maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küček has been active since the 1990s and has continued to develop new methods of encryption.
He also has an uncompetitive attitude toward other businessmen: he demands money only on the basis of money.
One of the new methods is to rent Turkish ports for a few days in the United States or European families.
In fact, ships are loaded with precision by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000 first to land and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human storage, for example in old industrial departments, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and go somewhere on the coast.
They are commanded to be hidden in the group of growth and to wait for signs.
When it is given, it's time to get up on the ship.
Travelers must stay all the way down under cover.
The seafarers can only observe how deep the ship is, because other signs of the human race are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less expensive and dangerous passengers, the better.
The small will receive about EUR 53 000 from one closing trip after costs.
He does not care for practical matters himself but hires captains, colourists, guards, tenants and other smaller factors to care for his work.
There are at least hundreds of medium-term transport and Küček is worth millions.
According to him, he bought land through hiding companies, a medical company and over a hundred dwellings he rented.
Muammer Küçek was detained in 2011 at the same time with a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a medical contractor.
After that, he's obviously gone.
Amendment 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The letter of the Death Travel Office is published here, not in the first week.
U.S. Olympics are told in their book about their disease and their act as a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, a 1,500 - foot - long [150 m] runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has highlighted in the United States.
Favor Hamilton says in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and thinking about being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated page would publish copies of the book as poetry.
Favor Hamilton decided his uranus to the Olympics of Sydney.
He came to the movies at the top of the school and ran into the casinos for the second best time.
At the end of the day, however, she had to panic.
He immediately began to climb up and to walk halfway through his country.
However, they lost their power 150 meters before the ground.
He broke down on the road, and other competitors ended him after him.
I knew myself as an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the painting line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered a two-month mental disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney committed suicide, and he himself experienced great hardships.
Favor Hamilton was 43 when he ran into a prostitute in Las Vegas.
Paris had no economic problems, but she was reluctant to get money from having sex with other men.
She also spoke to her husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's tax was EUR 450 per hour.
He's telling me he's using the money to escape.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s work as a prostitute was also that he had acquired similar adrenaline sites as he had received during his competition in the public ministry.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a two-month mental disorder.
The second issue of the previous issue appeared at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun was published in his article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was about 1,500 feet [3,57.40 m] away from the world’s statistics, but he remained at the end of Sydney’s Olympics.
The Master of the World was upset when he joined the Norwegian team of great-great-grandfathers.
In the opinion of his colleague, the Norwegian king Peter Northug has crossed the limits of his competence.
Northug and the Norwegian Federation have been guilty of the entire summer and summer of the last year of the sports contract.
Although the association has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been awarded to many world leaders and Olympic winners.
As a result of the treaty, the Norwegian Federation decided to close the Northug World Cup for the next time.
The decision was thanked by two-fold world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy to join the great crowd.
"Thank you for showing me a sign," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one of the active drivers to avoid working for the Union sponsors," he continued.
There's a matter of money between the Norwegian Great Union and Northug.
Northug would obviously want to be part of the rural group so that he could mention his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy when he represented the association that also cares about future generations and did not give up on the shoulders of one athlete.
At the same time, he recalled that the association has granted Northug both economic and other special rights over many years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a very different set of rules than just because it's the best.
Northug would publish his own information, which assured him that he wanted to play in the colours of Norway first in the world and then in the MMs and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won all six MM medals, of which two gold.
He was with us last morning in Falun's post office in the winning team.
The date of competition for consumers is also taken out in the Nordic countries
On Tuesday 25.9, fires will be organized in various restaurants and malls for which the competition of the Pastors has been granted.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high levels of Finnish food production and lower the level of departure of the restaurant and raise information about the importance of the bottle as a high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-quality restaurants have been concentrated on the main city hall, but there are high-ranking inspection and classification stations around Finland.
The international attention to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing awareness of competition facilities and organisations.
In the northern part of the country, a restaurant will be organized in Vaasa in the Fund and Canteral.
On the day of the contest, he participates in the restaurant of Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events in the world during the same day.
Finland remains the parent country of the event.
Exploitation paper: Establishment of an emergency reception centre to legal tenderers
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Red Cross (SPR) are currently owned by the LSK Business Park Oy, in cooperation with the former facilities of Kauhava.
According to the report, there is still a permanent crisis infrastructure in the region, which is a defence force and its partner, Finland’s Special Network of Oy.
The accident report states that the establishment of the reception centre in private would constitute a significant security risk which is not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have the interests associated with the area of the former Air Force School and the aircraft which have not been so affected by the preparation of the reception centre.
The case shows that negotiations have been conducted over the past two years in the Kauhava field on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any possible external operator's flight to the airport.
The issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistung (p.) and the Prime Minister of Defence, Mr Arto Räddin.
A private person shall ensure to the court that there is no question of the formal objection of the reception centre, but that the place planned in the former reserve area is wrong.
The city's city administration handled reception centres last Monday.
Tunisia: Syria's situation is deteriorating in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Government means that there are the necessary conditions for farmers and those in this area, the Ninst commented on the publishers of its statement after it has been used by all the presidents of the representatives of the public sector at the official residence in Mäntyni.
According to the President, he is concerned about the management of the refugee camp together with all the participants.
He considers it valuable that the Government and the opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidently.
Especially at times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to the Commission, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States can also be affected by the situation in Ukraine and by the situation in the Baltic Sea.
This is a hope for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Commission, the Nato issue was also discussed.
In the labour market situation, the President did not take a position.
Finnair leaves for spring 16 domestic planes, Alkot has been arrested for a couple of hours

The opinion closes the doors of Helsinki's central debate
The opinion to be held on Friday will close the doors of the Helsinki conference.
The police tell the Railway Service to shut down the car at 9.30 a.m.-14 p.m.
Cars from the direction of manning operations will not be rescued from Kiovokata, Postikata and not from the railway station.
From the Union to the Hakanjem will be guided to the Union via the Kaisanjem movement force.
According to the police, the closure period depends on the amount of violence involved in the statement of opinion.
Only vehicles will be rescued in the area.
Metro- and rattic cases throughout the entire period in the country of thought
Metro and railway transporters participate at the end of the night at the beginning of the morning.
The association of the Railway and Metro personnel told the STT about it last night.
Most of the originals are closed for two hours, including items closed
In the past, my interest also caused problems with Post services.
Significant delays are expected, including daily mail distribution.
Most mail services are closed.
The blood circulation of the Finnish Red Cross is treated without charge.
Atriums and hospital dispatches and laboratory samples are also sought to be treated.
The status information for the services can be found on the Posts website.
Most of Finland's origins are closed on Friday for two hours.
The Pam Service Professional Union has directed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also invited day-to-day trade workers to participate in the opinion of professional organisations.
The representatives of the SOK and Kesko will tell Helsinki Sanomi that the sellers are trying to keep open if necessary to the presidential power.
According to the Centre, there is still no information on the possible closure of private businesses.
Helsing's daily house was partially closed.
Helsing's daily homes do not work in full circulation on Friday, reports the Helsinki Early Ageing Office.
As a result of the opinion of professional organisations, daily care may be concentrated on certain dates and not on the organisation of day-to-day and play-to-day collection.
The environment is open to day-to-day communities as well as groups of more developed and diverse children.
In addition, the day-to-day activities of developing and austerity schools are normally organised.
The Office of Early Age will allow you to report further changes in the activity tomorrow.
Media researchers: Sip takes high risk
According to the media, there are a number of channels needed to communicate, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one of the other channels.
The channel of this direct speech also needs to be continued.
This won't be the last time, Sipil told the suppliers in the delegation.
She did not want to consider how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are going to be repeated.
According to the poet, there is no need to keep talking on the Ylen channel.
If other channels become channel channels, then they'll be considered.
Let's use this channel tonight, Sipl said.
According to the report, the situation in Finland is so serious that it requires citizens to keep television and radio communication.
This fact, which we are talking about now, is a time of pluralism and requires a longer basis.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Siplé found out.
The phone will be sent at 21.05 a.m. and on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
Sip takes a high risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipil's TV speaker will not tell us more about turning into the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more closely in its own hands and to reject public discussion issues? is it based on Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm?
It is recalled that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) was late to say that he did not comply with the media's agenda and did not allow it to be defined by himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these matters will not be linked to each other.
I understand that the commercial media has focused on Sipil's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media doctor didn't react.
The message types of political decision-makers are not reported in democracy.
The role of media representatives is definitely to try not to take up political agendas.
I think the TV conversation is a big risk for Siplël.
In his speech, the poet should bring up something new and special in order to meet the extraordinary high expectations set for the speaker.
Is there any more to offer today than we've ever heard?
Or is he able to speak differently, in different ways, or in different ways, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the promise is just the same old one, it must be wondered why such a great debt was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
This risk is generally taken into account if there is no specific situation in this area but for other groups of routine speakers.
The danger is that the General will fail to deliver a message from politicians or representatives and governments, which is certainly not in line with the interests of the Supreme or the general line.
The water from the well
It is also important for the next speaker to stress what the Prime Minister will leave without saying.
In the evening, we have to look at what Sipil is missing and what he doesn't say, says the University of Jyväskyl’s research coordinator, Heikki Kuutti.
I've heard that TV talk is coming from Sipil, because this will get to bring his own view to light without a lot of noise.
This means that there is a large public without a journalist, other than in the media, where suppliers can ask critical questions.
Sip will end the media and speak directly to the people.
However, it is dangerous that the media interpret something wrong, since there are no specific questions to be asked.
I've been saying that it's very important how Sipl is shown on TV - the pain of the pain, the release of your hands.
He's like the Simplica, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipl is able to make his point well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would know something about it, because this person is older than he speaks directly to another person.
These (U.S. President Barack) Obama and his partners are regularly celebrating.
A real exception.
Policy researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister is really strange to his citizens.
According to him, it has not been like this for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
It takes extraordinary time for extraordinary ways, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would therefore like to get Finnish citizens to contribute to the infringements that lie ahead.
Entrepreneurship organisations organise on Fridays an opinion and a bill against the government's actions.
In Twitter, the President of the Left-wing Union, Paavo Arhimäki, says that Sipil could hold his speech on the status of his nation in his delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister, where he would also be able to discuss it.
The President of the SDP, Mr Rinne (Sd.), once again will report on his challenging Sipil's dialogue.
Now there's no time for monologists.
Almost half a year from the election.
I can't hide from them. Rinne's writing on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the street has been found in Tampere
The boy was on his way to find him.
The boy was born on the Facebook page of the boy's father.
The Central-Suomen Police Agency will also confirm the matter for the Night.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the evening.
Later in the night, he'll be out of touch.
Dad appreciates all the people he's looking for.
Thank you for these ten connections and discoveries during these hours.
The update was divided nearly 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in this short period
The Finnish UFC has been deceived into violent vandalism by young people: You get mad at me at the time
The Kurdish freeman Makwan Amirkhani would publish a video on Facebook, which is particularly encouraging to young immigrants.
Makwan Amirkhani was under pressure from young people's peers.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and with his family in Finland at five years of age, has won a second professional exchange in the most appreciated UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that she received a message asking for an Instagram report.
The record contains videos where young people are killed with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me she's disappointed in the young people's vandalism.
At 26 years of age, Amrikhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of the country gets shot, sits on the other side and steals without any of these consequences, which is what happens when you do these videos, the day of Amirkhani.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people seen in the videos are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, social media video has been downloaded by both immigrants and young immigrants.
It's called that you're killing your superiors on the road.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Amrikhan remembers.
Amirkhani recalls that there are parties in Finland who are looking for the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very dismal.
It's a little hard, boys. I'll defend you.
You should remember that you're still visiting the country and you'll be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkha is inviting young people to remember their neighbors.
If they sometimes have to deal with someone's racism, then you can blame yourself.
Now think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, leave.
Amrikhan says that violent action will contribute to racism.
You're going to get angry in the dark when I don't like it myself.
You have a bad time, however, and you're not going to do anything better than it, Amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: Monday's decisions
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that the employer's position is based on an alternative inventory list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the proposal by STTK on Twitter.
The STTK Department of Action told its government in its previous mid-week proposal, which would require Prime Minister Juha Sipil (mean) to achieve a five-per cent production period.
President of Akava Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept a proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it called for the SAK to weaken its position earlier.
On behalf of SAK's President, Lauri Lyly commented on this in detail on Twitter.
Lyly writes that SAK's working committee is dealing with this matter Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market" and that agreements between active parties are needed as regards the status of barriers.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by Prime Minister Sipil's Government for a social agreement did not apply to SAK.
In the past, negotiations on a social agreement would have been interrupted when SAK did not agree to commit itself to the objective of the five-percent productivity category.
Comment: A major indication of the danger of approaching - "I know it's a little tricky wood nut"
I feel like it's a little bit like a wooden ring if there's already a matching paper in the bag, writes Pekka Tinanen.
The tunnels vary from the deck of the payer.
Is it meant to call a government to a coma or then to deal with it?
On Monday, SAK's co-chairs cleaned up the holy anger against government.
All of Finland was threatened with arrest.
He also destroyed the levisi.
The OAJ’s professional organisation threatened to close schools and day-to-day homes.
Ten years ago, OAJ returned: no school or day school is closed.
On Wednesday, the STTK president, Mr Palola (sd), expressed his agreement.
He told his Government that he was in contact with the government and that he had appointed Prime Minister Juha Sipil (mean) as the five-percent producer category.
President of the Akkava, Mr Fjäder (kk) quickly announced that his agreement was ready.
SAK's office would never have been cleared.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is in a difficult position when the Vice-Presidents just asked him to stand on the ground on Monday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's working group will meet first on Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to "open the working market".
In order to create a common presentation of employers, SAK should therefore adopt a five-percent production cycle.
There is no wonder that Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the Sipil government.
Mr Jukka Ihanus, Head of Social Action of the STTK, acted as Prime Minister Matti Oldhasen and Mari Kivinimen, former prime minister of the Central Bank.
The fact is, of course, that the ay-share of the government has improved all the time.
Whether or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean away from the Finnish standbys, whose speech was echoed by AKT's Marko Borderen (sd).
I'll feel it's a little bit like a woodcut if there's a piece of paper in the bag.
Modified at 6 p.m.: More information on Lyny's comments.
Russia became a bad father to Finland: "This can't be repeated"
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
In the opinion of the Russian Danish President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Etyj's master than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun a hearing of the General Assembly of the Estonian Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshki has given extensive comments on the welcoming Helsinki event.
At that time, Finland did not allow for the European Union's mandatory Russian policies, such as Naryshkin, to arrive at the meeting - a matter which the President shared with the suppliers.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the press office in Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the crisis of Naryshkin was directed against the United States, where it was also banned.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin published.
The Russian delegation of Mongolia came to an end, so Naryshki continued to live in Finland with the body and thanks to Mongolia for its "eremocratic organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly is moving constructively and positively, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that there is no obstacle to parliamentary dialogue.
Narysh has also met with Ilkka Kanerva (kok) at the Ulan Bator meeting, which has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Closes the real playoff child: "The ground in the wall"
Tappara and Luko will continue today at Hakamet when both will be on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today at Hakamet there would be no alien land guides.
The killer went to Kuopios last night in a three-2-hour drive from KalPasa.
The resurrection was a man because last time the Hope Group was the worst of the two worlds.
Well, I guess it was more molluscs.
The Romanian island of the well-started Blues was surrounded by rounds of zero points, and the fatalities were 2-3 years old.
A hard game, paintings in the closet, if any play the same game as last year, enemy Janne Laht predicts a follow-up site.
By the way, it has been formed for the Romanians with a pretty playoff pressure.
So far, the latter has just quoted from the book of the finals of the book of Luke in the middle of the two preceding years.
In both cases, a solution has been required for seven decisive masses.
Last time Luke took a row to the square in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three walls and ended.
There are no major changes, except in groups.
The fight against both of them last night will take place today.
On the ground of the battlefield, Mika Noronen is making room for Tom Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne is replaced by Ryan Zapolski.
View: During the course of the march, a severe display
The director of the concert, Toivola, wrote to the director-in-chief of the Rautakallio, writing from Santu Silvenoine Tampere.
It's classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone signed a Rocky painting, where he himself showed up.
The vice-president deliberately set up camps for the world leaders of the heavy line to Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost his title.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Doivola signed a Pori-free destruction machine.
A name-and-fashioned pasta package for all surprises to the SM-finals in 2006.
The group was full of names like Rocky.
It was white Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Pelt.
In the boxing games, players painted their heads red and cut off their iroquettes.
I hope you're blond.
The main television broadcaster JP Jalo called the manufacturer Neumannik.
You've got your voice on your winning hope.
The hope was one of the saints.
The author of this report, Mr Doivola, believes that this long-term innovation is working the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of a recent sport has built a store for bad guys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have gone along like Rocky's beads on the terrace.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Cuparisen are the causes of some other than professional playing.
The hope has been forgotten that at Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Routakallio.
Karri Kiv has been awarded the Red Sea to Sean Connery.
The railway station at Doivola is one of the top-ranking representatives of Rocky as Connery had been in his original shipyard in 1976.
There's nothing else on the railway than Rocky's name.
The play philosophy of the railway is not part of a circle and a small circle.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different things to play harder than a cat.
In the last time, the Essian Garret Stafford was looking for Tapparan Jere Karjas.
She got 2+10 minutes from the trial, but Rutakallio put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept such a game, and it's not part of the old man's game, so when the Routkallio went to the people after the game.
During this time, the team has been wonderfully built.
There's cops, veterans, cops and rapists.
There are no open men in the best game.
It's not surprising that the Chief of Staff has chosen an artist.
How much have you been able to influence the players' careers, Pekka Routakallio?
The recent developments have affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market has been tense, and the response of Rautakallio has been diplomaticly.
I'll get down to the roof.
By the end of 1953, Rautakallio had evidently been interested in moving to Doivola’s place as a sports club.
Men's contracts end in the morning.
The balance of the axles during the three times is the same as many losses on the ground floor 1-6.
The wish would not have supported the continuing process.
Olga Temonen shows Sipe Santapuki's mother
Bega Temon revealed that if she had met her husband as a teenage boy, they would have had nothing to do with it.
Olga Temone shows her husband for the first time.
Yeah, I'll show my husband's mother in the movie.
It usually feels crazy, an actor and producer of Olga Temon's smile.
He has been married to Apulanna ex-bashist and leader Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The Paris Group has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's leadership.
Oligan plays a role in the early years of Apulanna You made us beautiful in the picture has a rough Sipe Santapuki's mother, Sirka.
Circa smacks and supports her son, even though this father, Risto (shown by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be followed by the voice.
The more I know about my real ex-girlfriend, the easier it will be to present the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuka for giving me a role.
Oliga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, they've been a lot closer.
They've been around, they've been talking on the phone, they've been texting.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different worlds through their history.
It is also a good thing to understand that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be colored a little.
Olga points out that Sirka was in Heinolas almost the only one who deliberately believed that Apulanna would become Finland’s largest band.
In the '90s there was a lion and a real problem.
There was a time when there was a small probability that someone was really successful, but Sirika had something intuition, and she was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about this youth before the movie plans.
However, the stories of the parents have been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, as many parents really know what you're talking about.
It is evident that his youth was completely different from that of Heinola, known as the archaeologist.
Olga was a nice and nice girl who would have had nothing to do with the movie with Tuuka.
At least she could've kept her secret.
According to Oligan, for 10 years he has worked so much with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole producer group is going to the pictures in Heinola for months.
The couple in the village are really going to spend the night at home because of their small children, since the difference is not too long.
We'll be able to rule the whole Heinola month.
They've taken us really hot against us, just asking what you're missing and when they're empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose as Finland's largest sample image
Timo Vuerensolan leader Iron Sky: The coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
The pictures are starting in October in Belgium.
The leader Timo Vuorensola is starting to paint Iron Sky on October 2nd in Belgium.
Iron Sky's continued part, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will raise Finland's largest sample for all time at a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most famous film in Finland had been at the Big Game of Jalmar Helander.
The Angry Birds animation will also increase after the end of Iron Sky 2: because the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The pictures of Timo Mountersola and Tero Kakoma produced by the film started in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios rooms and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium in the first week.
I'm not afraid of leaving the budget.
I've been sick for a while!
I've got so much interest in the file manual because I know exactly what leaves should come from.
Everyone in the working group feels like they're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is hard, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I don't have to wait for me to show this tape to the public, he'll tell me tonight.
At the beginning of the film your budget was planned for 8-10 million, but the budget also grew as the manual was developed.
It's a big budget, but it's a big deal.
However, the film should be worth 100 million because each picture and performance is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no one to find.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a group management campaign and a group company on Wednesday, which pays 4-8 per cent of the annual rate.
The final height is determined by the demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The action plan includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Juntia or coolia?
The same logos return to places
The stress of the trendsetters has recently been corrected by the same logos.
Some time later, the well-formed dressers avoided clear and large logos such as Crocseys.
In any event, the mention of the name of the hopper or t-step was seen as a joint.
But time's changing.
Sports has become a real mega-style trend, as well as older, familiar sports models such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the college's alley.
And as often as before, noise and any trending limit are due: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a typical form where the trenders were surprised by the best possible softer basics of age than by the way they separated from the mass.
Now, instead of three basic colleges, it is already located on the base of the cabin, where the manufacturer's logo is located.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adida's railway networks, popular group games and New York Yankees have made it back to the roof.
At the beginning of the falcon's rehearsal, the early Calvin Klein logos are now cool details.
The trend appears to be moving from sports marks to luck brands.
For example, the strain of Versace’s tissue system makes it clear what is involved in the distinctive clothing.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian policy would have published evidence: I haven't been in the tank class for hours!
According to the claim, a special event would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was considered to be the product of the Russian military industry.
In Russia's media, there have been a number of negative allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to break down large numbers of Kosovo tankers for five hours.
He's been doing everything he can to block out the information.
He would even publish on his own Facebook page a picture where he appears to be very good at the end of the pastry car and at the same time on the basis of their pictures, it is nothing about being Jewelry or powered.
It's full of garbage.
Let's start by saying that I didn't go into the war zone, but it was the BMP-3.
I've served in Ural. I've been serving in the former military.
I went in there, I looked around, and I came out in peace.
I wasn't going to sit there and I didn't really spend five hours there, he said.
On the Russian army television channel, Donovo explained his favorite new technique in the exhibition because he is himself an ex-employee.
That's why I liked our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show, I'm going to probably use all the tanks and all the bunnies, you promised.
Dhodovo also complained about the issue as a type-examination supplier.
One type wrote and everyone else returned.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and round, but none of the things I've ever been in a tank, didn't happen, he told Russka lullzhba to novostei radio.
Ebola’s statement supports that no photo of the alleged involvement has been published, even though the exhibition took some time of 50,000 people.
The story of the presence of Ebokov started with the movement at the Bloknot.ru site, where he was told about the opening of his tank at the end of his attempt and the threat of the shootings were all around him unless he got out of his face.
Later, the Bloknot website would continue to be published where the exhibition organizers told about their own experience.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilän plan has been launched for a year.
The refined process of the golden age has been so called for from the bottom of the richness of the market.
According to the company, measures have been initiated to fix the year.
There is a need for a neutralised process of demand for richness and pure process fluid.
In general, water is pumped either to be used as a reproducible liquid or is driven by an environmental environment, according to a permit.
The year was estimated to be about 300 kilometers per hour when it was found.
According to the company, the quality of annual water needs to be met by current promises.
There was no environmental damage to other substances.
The year was found on the spot on Monday.
No structural damages have been detected during the year prior to the pathogens.
The company shall inform its close cooperation with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The plan works about six to six fixed employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against getting too close
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) report published today in Finland is in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of State Resources.
In order to deal with economic problems, the order has been put to work on structural reforms in Finland.
According to IMF, the reduction in overwork equipment and paydays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Amendments should be made to the whole contract system and to the safety of unemployment.
According to the Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamä, structural reforms are of the same opinion, but there are small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of information on government action, but on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be too much.
These are infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamäki tells the economy.
The IMF would also support growth projects in the shortest possible period in order to support weak economic growth.
In this year, the IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4 per cent, which will first increase by 0.9 per cent in the year.
Danske predicted that in today's new approach, there would be growth in zeros this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic than this year.
They may have had their last findings.
This morning the Statistics Centre told the total production was in the middle of a small growth, Kuoppamäki is real.
The confidence of the industry’s weakened or other softer measurements so said has to be refocused.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimal places.
Nintendo, who was about to die, named the new leader
In July, when Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under the Iron Curtain of Satoru Iwata, started working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and she was recommended and charismatic growth in the game.
For example, consider your success in launching the Wii console.
The choice of Kimishman at the age of 65 is not surprising.
He was one of the names identified as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for the Iwatan whales to follow, an Ace Research analyst assessed Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishman is to see Nintendo drive powerfully into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s taste for traditional toys.
Finland will only get more and more minor asylum seekers
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing every year.
In addition, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of minor applicants are missing in the country each year.
The Director of the Immigration Agency, Mr Kannelma, will tell you what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants lose "under" in the year?- In Finland a total of 156 applications for temporary asylum were made in 2013 alone.
You lost 9 of them.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them were received by Kannelma.
As a result of the disappearance, it may be that in the course of the proceedings, the applicant has already been registered in another country in which the Dublin Regulation applies and may have been found there as a full-timer.
In such a case, the applicant may be more likely to lose than to continue the proceedings in Finland and return to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Accordingly, part of the losses will also be found later when they are seeking shelter from another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were granted asylum because the applicant was likely to have changed from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is there a lot of growth?
Until 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for temporary asylum.
The overall statistics of missing minor asylum seekers this year are not yet available, but the number of minor asylum seekers is then known and it has increased clearly, which is likely also to affect the number of missing persons.
How are those who receive a translation decision?
Do they also fall into "black labour market" as well?
This is difficult to assess from the Agency for Migration, as the implementation of translation decisions is in line with the police, which can be stressed by Kannelma.
Interior Minister Peter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered farmers in the country.
He's been involved in this case.
At an EU ministerial meeting on asylum issues, Orpo told of practical actions on Monday to be managed by asylum seekers through Sweden.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of devices
Because of the disease situation, the cost of selling lost work in the media sector's vacuum cleaner Timo T.A. Mikkos's TV and radio production is now on sale.
Mikkos' side Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuta.net, which at the time were among the most advanced tools of the professionals.
The first website on the website was called Nightmassin.
Today, most of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs no longer depict Betacam ships.
Nevertheless, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested ones will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer modern in that way, but it is needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many firemen - collectors and construction workers of their own study, Nina Mikkonen on the basis of the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from the current home of Myrskylä.
We can't take anything with us.
I've begun to invent and see where the goods are created.
I'm starting with this, Nina Mikkone says.
There are no more TV or radio devices to use.
It is clear from the follow-up to the dental brains that a long-term urinary exercise has not been made by a man to return to work.
Nina Mikkone notes that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkos’s main life was in the archives at the time of the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives visited the film and other material from Myrskylä.
Transport is threatened by the worst thought: Metro and railways can stop for their entire flight
Metron and railway transporters today decide whether they are going to expand their forces into the entertainment industry.
The original plan was to adjust your metro and rail traffic only for a time of entertainment scheduled for spring.
In the evening you decide whether to stop your traffic all day long.
Mr Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
The night and day interruptions are worse for drivers, so the government plans to cut off the licenses raise the challenge.
However, there is a certain dilemma to stop transport all day long.
If the metro and the railways stand on their way, public transport is on the main road in practice in almost all of the stops.
According to VR data, the trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
They don't move around in the morning. They don't move around. They don't drive away.
The train leaving before morning is scheduled to arrive at the destination.
According to HSL, most of the buses will remain on the left.
The members of the AKT are away from work on Friday morning at 3 p.m.
It is likely that a small number of buses will be allowed to travel, they will be carried out by HSL's informant Spirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus routes are going through during spring.
Employer organisations organise a major event at the Helsinki Railway Station at 11-13 a.m.
Aftonbladets: The Hungarian police used exhaust gas against the Pakistani
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of thousands of refugees in an explosion.
The event took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, says the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border.
Many refugees, many of whom were women and children, were forced to leave their homes.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used watertights against people.
A Muslim boy was held in school in Texas - a teacher thought his own watch was a bomb
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after the teacher held his own school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to just present his e-mail message.
One of the teachers, however, had to be a real bomber.
The police were invited to the scene, and the situation ended when the boy was taken into custody in the custody of the youth.
Mohamed has not been found at any stage of claims other than that he had done at an hour.
Still, it is possible for a boy to be blamed for making a mistake.
According to Mohammed, the police have proved to be a real watch on the "fucking bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it is certainly composed of a cross-border and digital show that has led.
The incident took place last month, and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days in prison to leave school.
His father has a case in his hands and the American Islamic Council of the country is based on whether there is another evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
Brittany Kohizee - The Labour Director refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the royal palace, but Corby is a monarch.
The assessment of the right-of-the-law paper has also brought together Corby's own Labour Party representatives.
This has created a nation, which is estimated by the laboratory representative of Kate Green in the BBC radio station.
Green thinks Corby should have joined the song.
The British Air Force Air Force War against Germany Luftwaffe in 1940 was respected in last night's memorial event.
The Working Party shall, in its official opinion, defend Corbynia and stress its respect for the air carriers by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in great gratitude for the gratitude of the royal aircraft.
He (Corbyn) stood in a respectful position during the national prayer, which was highlighted in the opinion.
Corby's election as vice president has divided the lab's lines.
In particular, there are a group of people who are afraid of his masculinity in radical views.
Corby's support is for one-sided hostilities, for the end of savings and for the growth of public expenditure.
Corbyn is now the first time to appear in Parliament as Vice-President at the Prime Minister's hour of question.
Corbyn has asked the public what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
At the weekend, Cameron took the lead in Twitter in Corby's election as vice president.
The employment side threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, the Prime Minister said on his own behalf.
I don't know why family murder is still unfair. The father of the family was waiting for justice.
The South Lake Minneton police have recently investigated the murder of a family member in Minnesota, Greenwood, a week ago.
A family of five was found at home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the gun was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First of all, his wife was shot and three were killed by Brian Short in the car.
I've been dead for weeks.
The family was found after the school had been cared for by children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house to check on the house and found a large house for the Short's family when they died.
According to the StarTribunnen, it is possible that the victims had been dead for several hours.
Millionaire and a successful enterprise
A study of the case of Michael Sitar, a South Lake Minneton police officer, is still under way.
The cause of blood clots is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his properties on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, the StarTribinen survey told short that there are four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've had 50 purchases for the company over the last ten years.
I've missed them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to make.
At some point, I'm selling a business, but I'm not yet.
The loss was seen, among other things, that the Short's family bought from Greenwood in 2011 with two million dollars.
The apartment is famous for its property in Zillowi, where there are not only 12 rooms in the house but also 8 cars in the car.
Right-of-occupancy
However, according to the StarTribunnen, his father was waiting for a lawyer.
Achiev Test Prep, which offers various cross-sectional courses, had challenged him because of comments on AllNurses.com.
According to the Achieve Test Prep, the Short website did not remove comments from the prep auctions and thus lost customers to competitors.
According to the StarTribunnen, however, it is very unclear whether the exercise of justice would have had a significant impact on the business of Short.
Water Loir offered me some coffee
In addition, the owner's family was rewarded with a month's hire by Finnish Cypriot horseman.
It's great, Loir's comment is welcome.
The festival, Fabrizio Duo, won Derby's first Saturday in September and won 100 000 euros.
The artist's lawyer Loire was still amazed at the success of Fabrice Duon in the great competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the manufacturer of the Menestyshevos will be able to work with a full-time horse.
Pick up and decide which horse you're taking to compete.
And I'm holding my ass, Loir blew it.
A wonderful life from NHL - "To make a gift to the greatest performer of all time"
Montreal Canada's superintendent P. K. Subban has contributed ten million dollars (about EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital for children in Montreal.
According to the hospital's report, there is a unique gift of charity in Canada by the greatest athlete of all time.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital during the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens eight years ago and 72 million dollars a year ago.
The sum of Subban's gifts is therefore significantly greater than his $9 million annual contribution.
In return for his gift, Subban will receive a hospital named after him.
Canadian players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
A year ago, a long time ago, Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars, including the same childcare company, and Saku Koivu collected the money left for the city’s capital, where the hospital received a PET scanner needed for food research.
A Japanese coffee can make a wife's night... offering food just bikini and cheese on her head.
The theme coffee is a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has coffee, coffee, vampyry coffee, coffee and now wine.
It's going to be lonely, followed-up and hungry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Of the Tokyola Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee may be allowed to stay with your wife or husband during the evening.
There's a supplier who makes himself part of the customer.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before the coffee table comes and it prepares and offers food.
The baby's in the opposite direction. It's just a seat and a bike on it. The husband's still in the closets.
The website provides all the information about the length and pressure of the wife’s absence to which she would like to sleep.
Nearly 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: vehicle safety attacks were equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) will also support the technological development and innovation of the field, as well as the information published by Intel.
The High Commissioner is composed of top security experts from various parts of the world.
The ASRB researchers will be required to carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and planning recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices for cyber safety.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles are connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 % of these vehicles can be used, created and shared online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, Chief of Intel Security Chris Young says.
With ASRB, Intel can confirm best practices related to safety and support the view that cybersecurity is important in the design of each network-connected vehicle.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB community a real idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about EUR 52,000 in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as a month to come.
In the evening, the car also begins to be on the coast of Finland.
Ford published RS's data now that the car's tests are at Frankfurt's auto show.
The new four-colour RS speeds up by 2,3 litres, 350-powered motors in 4.7 seconds at zero per cent and its peak speed is 266 kilometres per hour.
It is also of interest to Finland that the price initially amounts to EUR 52 000.
The car is now on its way, actually when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford won't tell you when he's informed.
The brand Kia presented two news on Frankfurt's car show - these are new Sportage and Optima.
In Finland, two of the news is certainly more important than the new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia is going to catch up with the ever-increasing oil market.
In this form, a new European shape leader, Gregory Guillaume, created Sportage, has been created earlier.
The steel industry and the external commissions have been there since the second time and the car is getting more effective.
The engine choice is in its headwards, but it has been added to a 1.6-literal turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are said to be closer to the sale of revenue.
We still have to wait for it because we will get a new Sportage by summer 2016.
Just a year ago, our country was born with new Kia Optimati.
Maybe I see the news doesn't look changed, but there's a very new car.
Who wants to strengthen the hearts of the top middle class buyers by better driving properties, lower reading level and higher equipment.
Starting with 1,7 litres of turbodies and 2,0 litres of petrol engines, Optimos are available.
The first thing you want to do is to get to their wall with 2.0 litres of turbo engine equipped with Optima GT.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer will begin.
Chisu returned to the ships - he exploded into a brave disaster
The singer Chisu is with the child at a concert with other domestic stars.
In electric welding, there's got to be an open door.
The apartment presents the beautiful siren of the singers.
The crown of the crown is a gold metal sheet and a red sheet.
Over the past three years, the singer who became a mother has received heavy loads of punishment by means of heavy traffic and by side.
Chisu's daughter's gonna be over a year.
The psalmist would publish his first poem from the new edition in August.
I returned to the ships and the rise in front of the large public after a long voyage is not really bothering me.
It's been a bad thing to do everything about music, the song tells me.
Chisu publishes a new and same fourth album called Polaris a couple of weeks later.
Your new way of life has inspired you to make new plans.
At this stage you're wondering if people find my new album, Chisu's thinking.
Kim Kardashian's mother-style will be surprised again - now it looks weird.
The real-TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives talks after each other.
She presents her pregnancy and breast-feeding in sexy clothes, last night at a time in America when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kanye West in the middle of the night.
It's a black mother's suit. It's a crossword puzzle.
It reveals the idiosyncrasies below the surface of the sandy beaches.
The last time Kardashi wore an amazing motherhood when he visited his friend at night parties in New York just a few days ago.
The camp was forced into the black superpowers.
The third speciality of motherhood is both young and last week, when the presentation period was difficult.
Hard devices in the world: No home, you're lonely, competition is weird
The amazing Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the world would be a clean glamorous and funnel.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleague talk about the pure modeling.
The Harpeer's Bazaar paper of Leloupi's six hard truth behind the scenes.
Every season begins with empty.
Even if you had been posing in the premises of top designers over the past, the new era will begin again in Castinge.
And every year there will be new, young adults competing with their peers.
They rarely have a place they can call your home.
The work is continued travel and can take place every year so that it is a hotel room or apartment where the furniture houses its own model.
If he is too young and his mother cannot travel with him, loneliness can be an inevitable challenge.
New York and Paris want jobs, but they're all stressed out.
It's not just one kind of accident.
An agent in New York may ask for a pound, but in Paris it's said you're too fat.
Getting a job is a full-time venture.
The design models and designers are all together and work together as a support network.
When the formations are over, the difference is painful.
The models want this area because of the opportunities it offers, but they call them all thinking that the work is just a presentation of clothes.
They both want to be their own people.
The job is to let the models know that they're exhibitors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
I'll take you to Tory Burchin's show last night.
In New York, the best form vehicles are being transported, where designers reveal their first year of painting.
His style changed Roope Salminen presents unknown Apulta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautalaa, founder of the band based on the Apulanta-United years.
On the basis of this report, in 1991 he and Tony Wirtasen were founded in April 1991 but separated from the same year in 1994.
This is a time of great challenge for me because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen's joke.
I didn't want to meet true Anti before the pictures, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Anta is clearly unknown to people from that message, so I think it's very good that I'm just learning her phone type from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a man.
The very empty Roope Salminen and Koirat are not going to play.
The Punkmanes will come by their nature.
The stars, the stars, probably many in the punk season of the program, have seen the emoluments, even if they have never been on our trails.
Our presence has never been a little bit short, but it always goes perfect.
In April 1993-2004 the base was called Tuukka Temos's leader.
To the general public in the band, young exhibitors who are not yet known to the general public are presented to the large audience.
Rumpali Sipe Santapucki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtas Taku Sinsalo based Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a pledge from his future past last night, when he told Snapchat that he was secretly preparing his urine on the most important day.
Roope has already published a new look at the picture in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to do for the film.
In weeks and months, Roope, previously seen in the womb, has walked into its growth as a silopox, and colored her hair black.
Psychology advice: So tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to consider in recent days how to tell their child about the refugee situation in Europe.
Or is that what you're saying?
It doesn't have to be taken for granted, SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff's advice.
Smaller children are encouraged to protect themselves, for example, not to let them see the news on their own.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be kept in mind and worried, he says.
However, if a child has broken his or her TV news image or has heard something else, it will encourage him to speak.
The discussion is good to take the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking for.
The children's fears may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones that the parents think they're afraid of.
The child will not stand in fear of destruction, even if he is worried and afraid.
The younger the child follows his parent’s example.
If parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will also experience his or her security.
Grandparents are likely to disrupt the discussion of refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to take the matter to heart when it comes to their children’s thinking.
The fact is that not everyone in the world has a good thing.
Parents and children can think about how this is done in our family.
However, does the world think that it is a safe or safe place to end the end?
Parents may also have different aspects of growth - some may want to protect their children from the potential of anxiety.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult issues, the child will be given a model of how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This can be of benefit to him in the course of his life.
Social Psychology Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
Your own power?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child
Vermoon-dwelling Pallossalam hard hills
In the north, Apilan Palosalaman was attacked by the crowd at the center of the church.
It's just a bunch of winnings and doubles until the end of July, at Tampere's fairs, there's a romance.
Since the Ori was shot in the back of the family, the manufacturer suspected that something was wrong and took a long time to protect himself from animal doctors.
The explanation for the progress would be significant.
The horse had an accident.
The disease wasn't the best cure for it, but it's called for two medications.
Since Apilan Palosalama had to be on the move with ease, Northern tells you that she has been so impressed by the last flight of the horse.
It was a second SE in the preamble in Turkey after the Taruntuul.
Apilan Palosalama was very depressed when it was usually only a few weeks.
That the things of little attention at the end were to be understood, the North says.
The manufacturer assumes that the right competition has made it easier for the Ori.
The horse’s blood was certainly going forward, and hopefully it would have been even better.
Apilan Palosalama has been so said to have had a flurry of hemorrhage.
When it's not interesting, it could've been thrown to the ground without any disease.
On a good day, the source of the message has been removed from such a list that opposers have been amazed.
At the end of the day, the competitions will not reach Palosalam, from which even the warmest beds will emerge.
There's a Vermos in the North Hope.
However, there are different things about how Apilan Palosalama agrees with this.
It's a long time on the way to the driveway, and it can even move through the driveway, and it's like that.
Hopefully the line would have been more peaceful than it was from the market.
Apila Palosalama can come from the lake as well, and we will go to it for a victory, the manufacturer's promise.
So you can't get away from the secret iPhone program.

At least part of the future programs with Apple iPhone phones can sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple is going to remove some of its own programs from his iPhone phone in the future, and tell the company's supplier, Tim Cook Buckfeed, in the challenge.
The Apple iPhone contains a number of programs that are rarely used: For example, Facebook calls, Latvians, Health, Pörssi, Podcasts and Vinkit will come to mind.
The last addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a mandatory update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's intelligent owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been connected to some other iPhone.
If they're removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook's gonna make Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention what Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to get the user to remove them, beyond you, Cook.
According to Cooki, Apple then investigates the matter, because the company does not want to fire a memoir from users' iPhone phones.
The euro area inflation dropped by 0.1 per cent in August
In August, consumers in the euro area rose by only 0.1 per cent per annum, the EU statistical authority Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was below the drop in energy.
Eurostat checked for 0.2 per cent this time in a few weeks before it was assessed a little below.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
Thus, in August 0.9 per cent of the said North Inflation fell from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s preliminary assessment for the North-Easter inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent worse last month than last year.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Most of Europe's 1.4 per cent consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
Cyproxin inflation was at a lower price of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent of the minimum mark according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area is still very far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is two per cent's price rise in the medium term.
The ECB will predict an average inflation of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
In the first year, growth increased by 1.1 per cent, and the central bank was expected to publish its new inflation services early in September.
In the United States, Fed is trying to break the policy of money
The next rise in the United States starts at the rate of less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank, Fed, is moving back to its peak for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the sub-markets will start on their behalf before the next landing.
Fed has been leading its initial efforts as soon as possible this week and until the end of the year.
Thus, the next move can be put on top of the speed at first and the financial market's course towards it.
Or at least so if the world's largest economy and the financial market work as they have done, and if they react to the collapse of Fed's funds as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank in London in its extensive research into the long-term market and economic cycles of Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The Bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to international large customers last week.
The research and report strategies do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising its height or what is happening in the economy and in the market after that.
Instead, they present the facts and calculations of the financial statistics using the facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously been used during and after the feds.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine what the key changes in the economy and the financial market are now at the same time or in another model than in the course of the current trends - and what this may lead to.
Of course, both the economy and the financial market are now in a much faster position to cope with the rise in peaks than ever since the 1950s.
I don't think I'm gonna start this year.
The leaders who decide on the monetary policy of Fed and its cost-effectiveness have long been in the process and are beginning to argue that time is beginning to rise rapidly.
The first seizure over nine years may already occur this week.
The matter shall be resolved within the middle of the week and in the case of a two-day meeting of the Open Market Committee so stated by the Board of Feds.
Last time Fed won the so-called Fed funds in June 2006.
At that time, two years of relatively regular but once again a series of 0.25 percentage points, with which Fed won its weight by 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market outbreak began in 2007 on the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and later the year later the financial crisis became a major global day of judgment.
Great earthquakes occurred in 2009.
In the last few years, serious abuses of the financial markets and the real economy have begun more slowly than they have done since the previous feds.
Accordingly, the tests were more difficult and more expensive than ever since the 1930 ’ s.
Deutsche's strategies have resulted in the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the transformation of the financial markets since 1950 and the beginning of the 1800s.
From the 1950 ’ s, they have been making clear about the economic and financial effects of the Feds.
At the beginning of the pregnancy, the first pregnancy took place at the rate of less than a year, usually less than three years and less than three and a half years.
The financial market's course has been completed within two years of the start of the federations.
Fed has been up on the mountain and down the mountain following the beginning of the 1950 ’ s, a different cycle of the Tian Sea.
Each time, some of them have disappeared from the other, and the reports are being examined in a relatively accurate way, so on their basis, there is no certainty of the effects of the following adjustments.
The strategies also remind us that many things are different this time.
And it's not just better.
Crossword Puzzles Too Long
The root cause of the financial crisis was not necessarily to be found quickly by research for even ten years.
But there are three causes of the crisis and its devastating effects on the reason why it has grown rapidly:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and the world's largest central banks were too low in the 2000s.
They were following the technology plan, and they grew up next.
2) The financial and real economy's various shares have increased over the past decade and, above all, too much debt has increased over the impact of monetary policy on central banks.
The greatest debt in this economic history was born.
3) In particular, the most comprehensive financial sector-packed debt management was the largest interest rate for the most part in the financial market in the area of the economic history of the region in question on the part of the municipalities, the debt accounts and the benefits.
However, it is also very difficult to argue that the financial market was rarely in danger and uncertainty when Fed and other central banks were finally going up high.
The financial structures established in the reserve of debt trees were not able to bear the cost of valuation until after the savings had begun and the costs of debt management had risen.
Risks were committed as a financial crisis, and this resulted in a great defeat.
More money and more debt
The Deutsche strategies do not consider what is happening as follows, but give the subject of nuclear power, for example:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy authority to be much easier than before the financial crisis.
If the peaks were too low before the crisis, they have now been even more lower.
2) The debt has not been worse for a long time than ten years ago, but now the debt is worse in writing than in air.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been eased, but now in different parts of the economy the debt burden is much more severe than before the financial crisis or at least half of it ever before.
3) In the past, more and less-favoured liquidity from the central banks has remained largely on the financial market and has been reduced to the most expensive securities and property types since the financial crisis.
The strategies of Latin society are not just a warning sign of the financial markets, but they also note that not even the United States economy has been able to cope with the financial crisis and the most difficult decades to come to its model than it has been before.
The economy of the euro area must have done something else.
In other words, the real economy is inalienablely weak but correspondingly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed is going to cover its currency more closely.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French Bank of the Society General's strategy Albert Edwards is not as strange as it can suddenly affect.
He has been preparing international investors in the bank for the following complete rules:
First, Fed will raise the mountains, then the financial plates will relax, and soon Fed will be able to link the financial institutions to more and more QE funds.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce even 33000 jobs.
Some of the government's reductions are due to the HP's business service side, the company says.
HP is divided into a Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented HP Inc and profit-based HP Inc company in November.
HP's staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was suspended to 302000.
The company accounts for an annual cost of $2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The decreases in the consumer side will remain at 3300 over a three-year period.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low costs so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company will tell its balance sheet business so that none of its customers no longer receive more than ten per cent of its profit or loss.
In the second year, its three most important customers brought 65 per cent of the business result.
iOS 9: Apple publishes a new system of use – so install it iPhone
The new system may be installed by choosing Regulations, General and Software Updates first.
If the phone is ready for update, it will call the airport and install a new operating system.
Some users have encountered problems after installation: a bug report "programme update failed" has been published on the phone.
In case of misinformation, users are invited to wait for a break or try to update via iTunes.
I've been teaching my phone in the process of decommissioning.
Update may require removal of applications so the status can be relieved. However, Apple has made the update more compact. In addition, there is a tool that proposes to remove applications and reset them after the update.
The update of the programme will support ensuring that the phone has a release and that the battery is available so that the device does not end in the middle of the cargo.
If the boot level is too low, the phone will not allow the update to start. If the call window is empty in the middle of the update, the update can be broken.

Top: Minister Berner has worked in the tax administration
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (meaning.) has acted as a member of the tax administration of the company.
In general, the company's activities are associated with so-called tax planning.
This is the case with the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, which was named after Berner as a member of the government in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says he's left out of membership of the divorce notice in May of this year.
I've checked the matter and it's enough that I've left a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration products occur during the agreed period, says Berner in the Ylen challenge.
Membership after merger
The Swedish Kährs company is managed through the Luxembourg company.
He is a parking loter who joined the Finnish parking lot with Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner works in the government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the government of Khärs and in the Luxembourgian society.
According to the above, Khärsi's properties go to Luxembourg through the multi-port property structure.
Berner tells the General that he has taken a stand against government membership in the Luxembourg company of Khärs as the second largest owner's request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia-Upoflor government of Hartwall Capital.
The company was invited to cooperate with the company that was found from Sweden.
This company is owned by the head of the company, which has a company in Luxembourg.
I did know that my job was to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family head.
It is important that we ensure that the products of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and that they were secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells the public that Hartwall Capital's properties in the company are not linked to tax planning.
According to Berner, the multiplicity of the taxable property structure is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in Khärs in Triton was already equipped with a Luxembourg holding company for property.
In Espoo, the company’s maintenance reception centre opens
In Espoo, the first company will open a reception centre for senior asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred seats from this evening.
The number of seats can be increased within the week for up to 300 to 400 people.
The Agency for Migration shall establish the reception centre at the establishment of the former Rescue Agreement.
The action will continue to be carried out by Luona Oy, which is in particular the production of health care and health services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agree on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK produces an alternative working life registration package
The STTK is involved in preparing an alternative package for government work cuts.
The order also hopes that other employers' organisations will be able to do so.
According to President Antti Palola, at this point, there is a lot of concern.
Alternative means of reducing the price of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after dinner, Palola noted the organization’s management meeting with the suppliers.
Palola felt that the Central Union for Life (EC) was not prepared for discussions instead.
The economic operators of the STTK have estimated that the Government’s competitive capacity package would pay the employer EUR 30 million for a changeover of EUR 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party has the great intention to engage in the discussion if it has one hundred relations.
Palola: The negotiating relationship had to be built
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) has hoped that alternative proposals will be made by midweek, since then the Government will have to give its own package of communication to the delegation and start preparing the amendments.
Palola didn't take the position whether the schedule is realistic.
The discussion with the government is based on Palola, and it has been necessary to build it all the time.
The STTK's operating agency in the area of the STTK is particularly a rough place according to Palola.
The order requires that the government withdraws from the required legislation which would be implementing part of the infringements.
According to the STTK, Palola does not provide us with an alternative package to prepare the matter with the SDP.
The employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the government's presentation of a working life registration package last week.
Part of the package, i.e. the first sick days' salary will be paid, overwork benefits will be paid, sun pay will be reduced to 75% and the ceiling will be reduced.
It is stressed from the STTK that the central organisations have called the employer into consideration and that the purpose of the scheme has not been legal.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Mr Stru Fjäder, President of the Akkava, welcomes the notification by the STTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now come to the same lines with Akava, as Akava has more advanced options for the model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be provided with an alternative package because without SAK the package will not be enough.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akkava, hoped that Mr Lylyn would prepare the proposal for an alternative to interruptions, according to the future of the SAK.
Antti Palolan STTK told me last Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change-safe and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has already prepared its own presentation for a long time and is ready to discuss the goal of the country's government of five per cent of the competitiveness capacity for the cuts option.
Akava has been ready for consultation all the time, and we have long written out alternatives to government presentations.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the contract.
On the contrary, we want change-safe and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as the STTK has done in the past Wednesday.
Without SAK the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the country's government and employers, Fjäder says.
The Akkava Committee shall meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same water, common ice, roofs" - play bingo in Sipil's talk at night
Green Left of Tampere University
Viva's Bingo Cup tonight at the University of Tampere.
The Prime Minister has previously held exceptional talks during the occupation of Ments and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very strangely to the public about the state of the economy of Finland at the Ylen Canal on Wednesday at 21.05 a.m.
In order to speak in advance of the Prime Minister, he has to go back to 1932, when Pehr Évind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister at the time of the hearing radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the Cape Town.
After that, the President and the ministers held several radio calls during the winter and the follow-up.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held President Mauno Koivisto instead of the new year, but it was more of a ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended up on television.
A single call from a monarchist mine
The silent speech has aroused criticism and criticism all day long.
The President of the Left-wing Society Paavo Archimäki stated on Twitter that "Sipil could hold his speech on the status of his nation in his delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister when he would also be able to discuss it".
According to the Green Ville Niinistun "the single call has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Judges ruled on Facebook that "Monarchist mine: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
SDP's president, Mr Rinne, challenged the Sipel's dialogue: "I've been in the election for half a year.
Not only did the Prime Minister appear with the media opposition.
It's been tried.
What's @juhashila afraid of?
Public service
According to the people of the State Council, the Sipil spoken ahead of time and lasted about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, this was expressed in a direct letter by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC supplier Jyri Häkmies.
It is generally appreciated for the presentation of the Sipil speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service task of promoting a wide range of publications throughout Finland, lined up by the director of Ylen's publications Ismo Silva Ylen in the news.
As We Were When We Stumbled
The speech has also raised doubts.
In the evening, you will enjoy the good night’s walk, the children will cry, and the best will be kissed.
The mother puts on a clean blanket, and the father adjusts the amount.
At nine o’clock they are late on television than before during the time of We Tammelos," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipil also tell me why the Government of Finland is sitting in the taxable capitals, which have made other tax havens, and at the same time say to the people that it is necessary to cut money when the government has finished?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
What Siplä says, one opinion is that of the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It's a post on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same Russian, common wind, life and group life tonight?
The coupons and doors are ready, at 21.05 a.m. it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
At Ahtisaari Guardia: Westerners fought against the exclusion of Russia's al-Assad proposal
The West fought more than three years ago against Russia's offer by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to free the country, he told President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian UN has proposed a plan which, after some time, would have been very pleased to announce.
However, the Westerners did not object to the proposal because they believed that al-Assad had disappeared within a few weeks.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaer, Russia's Ambassador Vitali Tshurki listed three points in the two-part debate: the opposition was unable to get weapons, opposition and al-Assad was forced to contact immediately and the release from al-Assad was due to be carried out gradually.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not have to agree on all the same things, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that sitting down with Alas, Martti, so I tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers Guardian's challenge.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari tells us his message to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurki has not confirmed the content of the debate on the paper, but according to Ahtisaer, there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also rejected Ahtisaer's comments, but said that al-Assad's groups had already made several groups and central opposition groups rejected all agreements in which he had left power.
The former President of the British Foreign Ministry Sir John Jenkins is referring to the House of Commons of Ahtisaer because, according to his experience, Russia was not at any stage ready to discuss the case of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported al-Assadia throughout the war.
The worst point in Ahtisaer's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Shrurkin's speech, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin, so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have doubted that Putin's attempt to hold power on some part of al-Assad's support would have been in this case.
Return to our own things
During the Ahtisaa negotiations, about 7,500 people died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to leave their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The transfer of refugees to Europe is our own responsibility.
I don't see any other options than to take good care of these decent people.
Now we're paying the bill that we've caused ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the paper.
Tornion Centre for Security Seekers in Turkey
The planning of the administration in Northern Finland for asylum seekers is likely to be based on Toronto.
The centre would be based at the centre of the city on the construction of the Tower Community.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to improve the management of the refugee zone in Sweden.
Helsingin said it was clear that the Authority would have already decided to present a school building to your minister.
According to the Vice-President of the Town Authority of Turin, Saul Hyopis (V.) does not hold his place.
When the whole authority was not in school and part of the message wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the Bureau to decide on the matter for the first few months.
On the ground, 36 were authorized by 43.
In response to 13 orders from the Consortium.
On that basis, it may be expected that the decision is a positive, beautiful statement.
According to city leader Timo Nousais, the city received no contact on Monday, and it was reacted quickly.
The Community would evaluate 500 asylum seekers on a number of occasions.
The expert has taken the view that it could apply to such use.
The location is a couple of meters away from the border, so it would also be in the mind of it, The New Yorker says.
There is still hope for an option from the labour market for infringements
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) the public's involvement in gambling would only cover part of the government's goal of calculating the price of work.
However, the government considers it to be against the alternative package if the labour market organisations succeed in making such an agreement.
Sipil told the suppliers in the delegation that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for ways to pay back the government's tax on job abuses.
If such an agreement arises, we will take it without any further pleasure as part of the complete package.
Securing vacations would be effective in Sipil’s view, since it would target almost all employers other than, for example, the government’s plans to cut off Sundays.
The labour market organisations could be centrally agreed on the termination of pensions because they are written in the law rather than in employment contracts.
The Government shall inform the representative of the working life of the delegation of the first half of the week of its first appearance as a communication from the Council of State.
According to the Commissioner, the proposals of the organisations should be aware of this before.
There's no final backer.
The legislative work will then proceed to the movement, i.e. the chain is moving and it will become more difficult for the whole time.
Now's a good time.
I won't be long in these things if you want, Siplé.
In the last week of the administration's published list, there is, inter alia, a change in the final and hero's wages for the free working time of the year without a reduction in pay.
In addition, the first days of illness pay will be paid, overtime benefits will be paid, solar pay will be reduced by 75% and the ceiling will be reduced.
The amendments are carried out as a compulsory legislative end of professional associations which has aroused strong appreciation.
Employer organisations are organizing a major event on Friday, and many professional associations have also published political laws.
The authorities of the Republic of Turkey approved the extension of the assets of the Kingdom of Poland
The authorities of the Tohma lake agreed unanimously, but a small number of young Nordic Koivu Oy government, namely the extension of the Mahalalin estate.
The reason for this was that the project was much bigger and more expensive than the original one had been mentioned.
A fast schedule is also very rare.
However, it was little surprised that the state was not aware of this year when it was decided on the previous enlargement.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock was approved by 400 to 450 kilometres in the investment programme, but the funding is decided as a result of the contribution report.
The list further discussed the investment of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Iconen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported by the fact that it brings work and income to the local community.
There is no risk because the company pays investment rent, Vesa Väistö (p.) was founded.
A place in the Karjal language in Joensusu
The city administration of Lithuania has previously moved its position to the centre of Joensuu in the Caribbean.
The new decision is important and right in mind to choose a career tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu was not declared the capital of Karjala because it has no historical grounds and the language of Karja is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the village of Joensuu has become more and more of the Eastern Slavic dialects.
After the new decision, the centre of the city will not become a carnival catalist.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared for good consideration in the use of the Carthage language, for example in the information field and in the marketing of travel.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single citizen, as well as in the use of Karal language, it supports the attitude of the populace now when diversity lives and changes powerfully in the North Karillas.
The Karjalan language is still unique in the country, as well as a beautiful Joensusta throughout Finland as a forest town.
Both can make good use of them in a variety of markets in the country.
Disengagement of connections stops the animal health of the country
The cuts of connections are due to force the country to live with a strong hand.
Business relations directly affect the life and competitiveness of the country.
And it's going to affect whether we can stay here and do work, the city leader Karjalanin is surprised.
He is also referring to the air traffic which has continued to be reported on several occasions.
It is important for the whole country that our opportunities are not limited by State measures, as we are doing now.
The effects of these restrictions on employment should be seen, for example, by Karjalinen.
The deterioration of social relations causes an increase in the attractiveness of the University of Eastern Finland.
Of course, the better services there are here, such as traffic connections and housing, it is easier to get students and workers, the director of the University of Eastern Finland, Jukka Mönkönänen.
He notes that bad traffic relations also affect the research team, which is very moving and travel through much of the research.
The Recruitment Officer Marko Junkrikinen says that the marketing of the university in West Finland is already difficult because travel links are weak in the way of eviction.
About half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland will now come from outside Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, which is explained in part by direct communication.
The revolution came one time for your army.
The view of the city administration of Joensuu on the earthly project of your army is apparently unique, but one of them is a group.
Mr Pentti Kesksakilo (c.e., picture) presented the government's Monday meeting with a discharge on the whole project, but his presentation was not backed up.
The Government adopted the Cari Karjali decision-making session, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the city administration meeting, which will give the project final opinion at the same time with all other citizens.
One spring from Kotka to Koulola in the first year
Your personal transportation from Kotka Koulola to the future will remain, even though one generation of Europe is rarer.
Changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola will take place in March first.
One Saturday's left, but five more days later, Kotka will arrive at Kowulola and on the contrary.
Suspension is due to State savings.
For the next four-year period, purchases of transport and communications services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest streets will be completely destroyed.
VR creates new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys jumped to the floor, one didn't get down, the guys moved out.
The rescue plant survived a massive catacomb at the age of 12, which was not even able to get under the catacomb.
The situation was born in Toronto, Ketotalia, about six o'clock in the morning.
There's an old two-sided tree that doesn't have any leads on the floor.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house next to it for a long time.
Some of the boys went down the same road, but one didn't.
As a result, others moved from place to place and the shipyards warned the rescue plant to help the last cat to safely return to the ground.
FedEx in trade exchange, weaker views for account 2016
FedEx published its last year's failure. The transport sector has been weakened throughout the year by reducing demand for railway services and increasing costs of agricultural services.
The company is going to hire 55,000 cooks for lunch.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it was paying 50,000 employees for the holidays.
The company’s share was estimated at about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the domestic market on average.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40–10.90 for the cash finaled in May. The interest rate is 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The discounts have decreased by 4.9 per cent despite the average price reductions in the course. The increases will take effect on 4 January. Additional payments will be made in November for heavy or large shipments.
The company is still looking forward to growth from the previous year as a result of cost fluctuations, increased trade and growth in network trade.
President-in-Office Fred Smith stated that the company has achieved a much more well-measurable economic situation, which has tested production and world-wide trade in particular.

By the end of 31 August, FedEx's annual turnover target was $692 million, which means a six-percent increase.
The partial result was $2.42. Zacks Investment Research Company's 12 analysis of $2.44 was then lost.
The trade rate rose by five percent to $12.3 billion.
According to a six-year analysis by Zacks Investment Research, a turnover of 12.23 billion was expected.
In recent years, FedEx has been attempting to reduce the number of shipments of international units, which has led to the collapse of the operation of the company Express unit.
The strong growth in network trade has been confirmed by the outcome of FedEx Ground.
Over the last few years, trade in agricultural products has grown by 29 per cent, but the trade force has seen the corresponding costs of large shipments and insurance.
The unit of expression produced better on the basis of higher basic fees, while the production of railways decreased due to higher labour costs.

In December, the share ended 11 per cent of the annual average value and 17 per cent of the highest rating recorded on 11 June.
This week, the U.S. Central Bank’s decision-makers will meet for the most anticipated meeting for years. Whether the group will sit on its knees to decide whether it is time to raise the peaks for the first time in almost ten years.
At the wall of a two-hole meeting room of the Central Bank, the United States has a building to provide.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, has to set the financial advantage of the State before all other interests.
The Central Bank has a double rate for conventions: maximum employment in the United States and keep prices constant here.
However, after the Grand Chamber, the Central Bank’s leadership has noted a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be lacking in the case of a decision of the Bank of Torstana on whether the United States economy is ready to start a visit from an unexpected business which has been offered short-term increases by the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent drop in the financial markets can already be prepared by the authorities of the prudent central bank to reduce the increase in the vacancy rate by increasing the reference rate of the State’s taxes – even by a quarter of a percentage.
"The labour market and inflation are of course the first and most important in their practical monitoring," says the banker Steve Nicolaus & Co's lead economist Lindsey M. Piegza.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank seeks to make it possible to be tax-free, the increased uncertainty of the global markets is sufficient to give the subject enough to wait," Piegza continues.
The underlying issues are not the same as what the central bank intends to do, which is already causing anxiety.
About half of the economics in Bloomberg's study revealed the rise in peaks this week.
However, the financial markets take into account the expectations of the central bank, and according to the most important indicator, only 30 per cent will be able to rise.
If the central bank raises its leadership rate, partial courses can be calculated, the decision makers will not slow down by promising another rise.
As a teenager, the Dow Jones industrial average index was 228.89 points or 1.4 percent units 16 599.85.
"As a result of the fraud, the central bank was expected to keep the leadership school steady this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski.
"It would be surprising if the central bank would rise high at this stage," he said.
"If this is the case, the Central Bank should give careful consideration to how the financial market's hands should be considered."
On the other hand, the experts pointed out that raising the prices could calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a few months later, the Central Bank had the impression that it would rise to a height of 0.25 per cent this month. This would be the first small step in strengthening the financial situation and strengthening the United States.
Yellen has proved to be a long-standing and long-awaiting rise this year – despite the need for economic progress in terms of liberality.
Although job creation was delayed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate has dropped by 5.1 per cent in the last month. It is now at least seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be fully employment.
The payoffs appear to be hijacking.
Although inflation continued to fall below the 2 per cent of the central bank’s annual targets, the central bank’s decision-makers pointed out that the main reason for this was the temporary impact of low oil prices.
"The economy can reach even higher levels and needs them as soon as they take into account the strict situation of the labour market," Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said.
However , through the financial market , the world did not continue in the last month , when China squandered its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average almost 16 percent of the forecast increase in May and investors were afraid that China's economy would also be affected by global growth.
Markets have collapsed this month, and Dow Jones has now estimated nearly 10 per cent of the increase in inflation in May.
The market growth of the central bank's decision-makers means that the rise of the steering class is constantly changing.
"The work of the Central Bank is changing regardless of what has happened on the financial market and what news of the fall in the economy in China has come to light in recent weeks," UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, former researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner said.
Now he believes that the central bank is waiting for at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"I am very uncertain about what will have an impact on the economy of the United States. There are no reliable information about the recent developments in the economy in China," Oliver said.
The improvement of the global economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential will of the world's financial economy.
The impact of the central bank has been great in recent years.
In 2013, only then, President Ben S. Bernanken pointed out that the central bank could slow down its activity in time, while the world was in trouble.
In today's world markets and economies are strongly attached to each other. In addition to monitoring the world's development trends, the Central Bank also needs to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science," noted the Director of the Global Strategy of Investnet Incin.
President of the Regional Central Bank of Jeffrey Laker Richmond stated this month that the Central Bank has previously overridden financial markets that do not have any contact with the fundamental players of the economy.
Mr Lacker, who was elected to the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Committee), succeeded in drawing up the steering committee, for example, in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in the area led to the decision by the Central Bank at its three meetings to reduce the level of leadership of 0.75 per cent, although only border-recognitioned penalties were available for economic growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank decided.
"The central bank should only place financial stability for the first person in a significant crisis, such as in the collapse of the 2008 economy," said former member of the Executive Committee of Adam S. Posen, Bank of England.
Last time I was dead, I didn't even get close to that situation," she said.
"The rise of corruption in the name of no one will stand for fear of market collapse," Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention the stability of the financial economy. Before this change comes, I don't have to go on."

Association of Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Doctors to Promote a Good Food Choice
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a sugar-free way of teaching female breastfeeding the importance of good nutrition. They are presented with images of babies born from a wall with an unhealthy diet.
The human breast-feeding body is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, thus giving the baby everything she needs to eat and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of excessive energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie levels by about 500 kilograms.
According to the new study, in addition to increasing the calorie level, other changes should be made to the food chain.
A recent study by Professor Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, Robert Waterland, revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the babies’ genes and protect the baby from the development of plants.
Unfortunately, poor nutrition was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunris is the biggest viewer, even though Nine is trying to get a lead on Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson commended Canberra for setting up a morning programme for the follow-up of the leaders of the Liberal Party, which, however, did not directly affect Today's audiences.
The Nine-Canaan morning program was sent from the capital of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
David Kochin and Samantha Armytagen were sent out from London on behalf of a competitive Canadian morning program. A number of special missions will also be sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
At the very least, there was no significant importance for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise considered an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals of the country, and today's programme was 339,000 viewers.
In the past few months (317 000) and in the past (283 000) have been seen, but the last tortoise (343,000).
Today's been under arrest for the last month of Sunrisen.
In August Todail had an average of 318,000 spectators, Sunrisella 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were 40,000 to 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has again reached an average of 349 000 spectators and today 314,000 spectators.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The changes in the winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

From the point of view of the final match, Sam Wood is actually a son of the dream – but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed their undesired son's choice.
The final choice of the dream boy Sam Wood has been a well-known secret.
The three remaining women do not even know who's got the last move from the boy.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Yeavans-Fellows the feelings before one of the three was shot off.
Sam Wood's voices are definitely sealed up to the end of the cake.
All three women complained that Wood is a perfect man. The women urged the man to commit adultery, adultery, family values and positiveness and made him an ideal partner for himself.
When women were asked who would be my best partner to Wood, if the last meal did not belong to him, they could give their answer to the one who took the boy's heart.
Jaavans-Fellows and Marcosski quickly named Mackay himself as the most suitable partner for your friends Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have all gone easy since the beginning.
"I immediately came to the house and noticed that Sarah and Sam agreed very well. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jaavans-Fellows said.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and she's really happy to follow," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there is chemistry between them.
They're acting naturally from a couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks you and Sam Woody are a good couple.
Mackay told me that he had been hit by a domestic crime scene last week, that Wood could be right.
"When I saw him in the company of my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a dog. I'm putting our relationship in perfect shape now," Mackay said.
When Mackayl was asked who Wood should be chosen if he didn't choose him, she replied respectfully:
"I can't say," he said.
"I've got a lot of other girls, Snezana and Lana are equal."
Sleeping boy Ten-canal Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
This is the case at the beginning of the search "Sarah Sam Wood's choice?"
Jarryd Haynel has several options for launching the NFL
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Haynes, which was transformed into the United States. Many others were also interested in him after the opening day of the last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and author Jim Tomsul, and the choice appeared on the button.
Some manufacturers would have kept on Haynen's belt, as the man walked on the shores of the Australian football team. Heyne electricityed the flight home to the team to win the winner from Minnesota from 20 to 3.
However, Tomsula showed her trust in Hayen and gave him a new opportunity to return to the airport. The manufacturer held in Hayen's game after Reggie Bush was fired.
Tomsula also continued his line in his pockets after the game.
He didn't steal the results in front of the other group but encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly after the game in a long press conference.
49er's Specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Specialist Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget his failure and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is playing with the first quarter of the game played against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans were waiting for another man from NFL.
Hayne was removed from the field after failure and later told Hamish and Andy 2DayFM 104.1 channels later that she could not have imagined the more severe start of the NFL wave.
"They're hurt and have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne made a mistake when she was debated in the State of Origin series in 2007, when her food in her own area opened up for Queensland.
In general, there was still an incredible experience for 27 - year - olds.
Hayne would publish an image in Instagram where she's dating with the fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Russian rich man Mihail Hodorkovski was arrested by a dangerous airport in Cyprus.
Clearly President Vladimir Putin challenged Hodorkovski's judgment, the man's own oil company Jukos was excommunicated and his democracy was restricted.
Four dead police officers shot at every corner of Nepal.
Four people died in South Nepal, the authorities told us about the weekend. The police shot a group of people in the neighborhood in an opinion against the alleged new constitution of the country. The victim was a four-year-old boy.
The authorities were attacked in the Rupande region on Tuesday evening, about three hundred miles from the capital city of Katmandu.
According to the border overseer Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, over 1,000 spectators were gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used gas and came out before the bomb was fired.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It is not quite clear why the mines that can kill but which are generally considered to be less destructive as an alternative were immediately so deadly.
This included a small consensus in the ongoing protests in the southern part of Nepal, where new countries based on the new Constitution of Madagascar would weaken their political influence.
The protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus Home is required by its state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent incidents since 10 August,
in which four major political parties signed an agreement on the distribution of land to rural areas. This is an important step towards a new constitution, but the issue is very difficult in Nepal, where governance has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been in force since 2008, but legislation speeded up the process after thousands of people died in the earthquake that struck April.
The legislators have voted in favour of the draft constitution in Katmandu this week, and the authorities believe that the new constitution could be adopted by Sundays.
NHC Emergency Centre: 60 per cent probability of cyclone by Cape Verde south
From a large underground area of about 560 km to the southernmost part of Cape Verde, 60 per cent of the population is likely to develop over the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center.
According to the Miami Air Station, there is also a clear low-pressure centre between Cape Verde and the Little Antilleans. It can also be 60 percent likely to develop into tropical cyclones during the next two seasons.
Google is going to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced its launch of a campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organizations that help various parts of Europe to combat war and poverty in the face of thousands of people.
Google reported a special personal campaign on its blogs.
Instead of the leader's campaign, Google's employee Rita Masoud told her personal experiences. She was only seven years old at the age of Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark on bicycle and bus and ate hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
A family in a similar situation in the aftermath of the European refugee and transition crisis is desperately looking for help.
The solutions will be awarded to non-target organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children and UN Refugee Organization.
When donations are collected by google.com/refugeerlief via $5.5 million, Google promises to provide the corresponding amount where the total amount exceeds 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is the worst of the second world war, and the situation is particularly worsening in the Syrian four-year internal war, which has caused more than four million people to leave home this year.
The war must also be withdrawn from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Hypertensive diabetics may benefit from exercise
According to a new study, overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from body weight loss for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say that the excess type 2 diabetes live slightly longer than those who receive treatment without interruption.
"It takes time to get mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the immune system, who examined a new study on JAMA Surgery.
In the exercise of body weight, which means that the barrier surgery is reduced by different methods.
The surgical methods reduce hunger and limit food intake in the body.
Over the years, barial seizures have been found to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have been involving patients with a weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the ratio of weight and length with a normal value of 18.5 to 24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index is more than 30 indicates significant mobility.
You can calculate your own weight index by reference 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study of Taiwanese Min-Sheng hospital researchers used data collected from 2007 in a study comparing the two immune system, end-of-life and renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus in healthy subjects.
The weighted weight index was calculated from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the fifth study year.
The weight index of those receiving treatment without interruption was maintained at 29 years of age.
Diabetes was improved by 36% and by 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved by only 1% and by only about 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were also better in the treatment group.
Researchers also followed levels of haemoglobin-A1c in patients describing the development of blood sugar.
According to researchers, the haemoglobin-A1c recommended levels are below 7%.
After surgery the haemoglobin-A1c value decreased by 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained at about 8 per cent.
The haemoglobin-A1c value tells us about the management of blood sugar levels. However, the study group conducted by Tri Chih-Cheng Hsun stated that this did not, however, reduce mortality during five years.
The study group also compared the results of two different methods of disposal.
In the 5th year endpoint group, the weight reduction was higher than that of the nitric acid group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the concentration of the concentration index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as well as the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
However, according to a new study in Blackstone, which works at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, the Swedish study did not intend to show less mortality after five years.
In a Swedish study, they were meat for persons who had an endpoint, the likelihood of mortality for 15 years was less than 29 per cent of the traditional treatment received in comparison with the group.
However, while no lower mortality was found in the new study, Blackstone found that persons under 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, as it suggests that the elimination is a safe lower pressure index in the group, and it does not increase the risk of driving or kidney problems," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should be treated with severe stress when the weight index is 27-30.
"We are waiting too long for people to begin to react seriously to the situation," the researcher noted.
"When the human body has undergone genetic changes that lead to body and diabetes, it is really difficult to change the situation."
"Not All Can Come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe will not be able to accept all refugees, the Dalai country has proved that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in refugee homes.
Dalai-Lama addressed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom. Dalai-Lama held his talk at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, located in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, mankind must be placed on the front of individual countries or countries.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to refugee crises must be amazing, it is not enough in this situation.
"I cannot believe that everyone could come to Europe," Dalai said in his speech.
Although Dalai-Lam praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The provision of thousands of refugees is a great thing, but at the same time we need to consider long-term solutions and how we can at the time get help for peace and real development in these Islamic countries, almost through education," Dalai-Lama stressed.
"We must finally consider how we can reduce the killings in these countries.
Power consumption needs to be reduced.
Power machines never have problems solved," he added.
In addition to speaking with Germany, Dali-lama commented on George Bush's activities in connection with the terrorist attacks on 11 September and claimed that the US was in the process of uncontrollable events in response to the terrorist attacks.
"After 11 September, I expressed my concern with the President of Bush and told him that the solution was based on non-violence.
I know that his purpose was good, but he protected the forces that had countless consequences," Dalai Lama said.
I've been dealing with abortions in four-year-olds
According to Georgia's Meteorological Centre, in various parts of the United States, alcohol consumption is increasing dramatically in children under four years of age from 2010.
According to the head of the Georgian Mining Centre, Gaylord Lopez, I reported to the Mining Centres during the 12-year period, children increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are still growing in children, and unfortunately part of the children are getting pregnant," Lopez told CNN.
According to the finaleiz, children take orders for the purpose of making part of their friends and part of social media abuse.
In YouTube videos there are teen-ages that take the disinfectant because of a bad smell.
Others are told that combined with deinfinated alcohol juice to get stronger drink than alcohol.
Smaller children can pull their hands together.
"The child doesn't think the matter is bad," said Lopez.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products are just frozen.
The offer contains soft handmade products of manicure, wine and orange, which attract children."
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfectants is 45–95%.
A small number of young children may already be exposed to alcohol abuse.
"The alcoholicity of my hands is very high," said Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital for Diabetes, at Fox 4 Canal in Kansas City.
"No one would leave children's long-range whiskey, but if hand disinfection products are often left to children's long-range, they will soon get a high amount of alcohol."
At six years of age, Nhaijah Russell enjoyed nearly four laureates of manicure at school, and a girl was provided to be treated as a nurse.
"The alcoholicity of the blood of the fetus was 179, which is twice as high as a adult human being," says Dr. Chris Richchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was so strict and couldn't walk when he was brought to bed.
Doctors followed the girl’s condition at night over a different childhood hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and had poured out alcohol on her head," Ritchey said.
"Your love was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Finally, it is recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants as well as that your hands should be transferred to children’s non-expendables.
In addition to alcohol consumption, some disinfectants have been combined into fatalities.
In 2013, two of the Onnarians died of needles containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contains the deadly methyl rather than ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported to be an active substance in the product list.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of New York State planned to kill a "high" teacher in January by setting antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher was very allergic to orders and refused to bring them into the classroom.
The police considered the past plan to be of no importance and invited training to commit suicide.
Huhumylly: does not interfere with Celtic’s borders
Griffith reduces the disability of the Celtic group when Deila admits that everything in the group is not good but believes in the situation she has.
Hearts stuck against SFA's punishment of Nelson, and Warburton warned the players on January so that the unity of the group wouldn't suffer
Aberden's neck Celtic five points
The first half of ADAM Rooney's sentence brought Aberdeen a great victory from Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory led to Aberdeen's five-point battle against Celtici.
Griffiths reduces speechlessness
Griffiths has been on the side of the crisis on the Celtic border. According to their own, Griffiths and his team are not ready to meet the leader of the Dutch line.
"We don't have any stress. I think players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch are looking for old Scottish warships – de Boer
Former Ranger's central player and Dutch football player Ronald de Boer have found that the Dutch footballer's interest in Celtici has ceased because Celtic and Ranger's double-played games are no longer allowed to follow.
De Boer, a member of the team of Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands there is no longer a site for Celtic games.
Because Rangers is no longer involved."
"You don't just talk about Ranger's request.
This is where we talk about the Old Company.
The Dutch are looking for two rounds between groups.
The Old Company's games are full of excitement, and they are also interesting outside Scotland's borders."
I'm going to be okay, Deila's gonna make sure it's okay.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic has difficulty, but your Nordic hope ensures that there will be a change in the situation.
Malmöl lost his track over the Masters and lost ten players to Aberdeen, now leading five points in the table.
"Celtic has had difficult times before, and we're gonna get up again," Deila said.
"We want to adjust our situation as quickly as possible.
Your situation is very devastating, and it stirs up a lot of anger or rage.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
We desperately need the support of Celtic's supporters, as it strengthens players very much.
This is very important now."
Warburton cautioned in the games of January
Although only a few weeks ago the Rangers-bomo Mark Warburton took the lead in January, he was careful about moving around and said he wanted to threaten the unity of the group.
"Tammoon players are significantly different from summer shifts," said Brentford ex-Valminator.
"The players in the middle of the group are able to get through the group before the start of the group, which has been successful in our meeting.
The class's going really well.
Sometimes unnecessary players can cause more harm to a group than benefit."
Michu based on decommissioning at the target of Celtic

Hearts prepared at the SFA exhibition from Nelson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The group finally disappeared from 3-2. The defendant's red card was dropped later. There is already a third Collumi's red card within eight months.

Unemployment in Scotland, growing in the UK
The unemployment rate remained unchanged in Scotland between May and June. Unemployment is 164,000. The total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent when it was 5.5 per cent throughout the United Kingdom.
There are 12,000 fewer than three months earlier in Scotland.
Scotland's employment rate dropped by 74.0 per cent per year. The average employment rate in the United Kingdom is 73.5 per cent.
"The long-term plan of the Government is based on a strong economy," commented Scotland's Minister of Affairs David Mundell.
Almost a year later, Scotland made a historic decision as part of the United Kingdom.
Scotland's labour market situation has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I follow the trade in Oklahoma?
Later today, where there is a legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow up on the business.
If the operation is carried out what I don't hope to do, I will sit in the courthouse of law enforcement of the state of Oklahoma, where Richard Glossip is executed in the Turkish language.
Glossy has asked me one of the four official witnesses.
In January I received a call from a best friend, and despite my disappointment, I responded positively.
I'm in danger of being around the clock.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you this about the death penalty.
The vision would be unique.
Operators will be able to monitor operations in the United States, and since applications are more than locations, participants are selected with a macabre value.
Oklahoma has reduced the locations of suppliers to 12:00.
The selections will follow the performance on a case-by-case basis.
I can't do it.
I've created a man's personal relationship, because we've been talking on the phone several times over months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We used to laugh when we talked.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present both as a witness and as a supplier, so I cannot take into account my memory loss and urge me to make comments.
I just have to try to weigh my details.
A Ukrainian supplier accused me of threatening non-participation on Twitter.
"The owner is:
When you tell him the story you're going to tell him in a pleasant way, you'll get close to him."
I presented my opinion to the supplier.
The executive agreed that he could have made his words more careful, but still considered my actions wrong.
Richard Glossy's been thinking differently about something I've said and written.
He doesn't know what I'm writing, and even if he was trying to count, I wouldn't.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants a place for an international supplier who can write about what happened.
If Glossy dies, he believes that the public will promote the fight against death.
Huffington Poster Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on this subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I'm not gonna repeat details in this connection.
I can't say that Richard Glossy is guilty.
After Barry Van Treesen was murdered, they would have done him for the crime after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that Mr Glossy has not been charged with murder.
I do not believe that the evidence on the basis of the death penalty was not sufficient.
I think his performance is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his business.
I can't claim I'm completely neutral.
The picture of a non-participation can be read from other suppliers.
I'll tell you how it feels to see a man die in hell.
A man was kidnapped from Canningjo after a drunk police officer.
Canning Vale's observatory stayed dry while he was touching a man from Canningjoe.
The man's supply of water was on your back, on the other side of the water, and a few meters of police were forced to land on him back into the dry land.
Canning Vale's police got a phone call from an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading to Caningjoke.
But the man didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he didn't come out of the water and asked the police to get him out of the water," said the former superintendent.
Constable Lachlan Perhavecia did not appeal, so she chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
"The other way to protect a person is by means of means of security," said Colonel Castledine.
The Ben Cousins case is an example of an impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins refused his car to avoid police interrogation and tried to contact Swanjo on the other side.
The man's business was doomed to destruction, but the heat moved the locals to design Ben Cousin's Biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the suppliers were trying to keep their eyes open, and he threatened to stop the competition
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victorian's agents of the insurance company of his last year. The man threatened to stop the competition immediately.
Moody claims that the prosecutors and Racing Victorian charity have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tatai recently due to the treatment recently given on Wednesday was the last few weeks.
Moody told Fairfax Media to always work for the sake of competition. Moody had to be in a difficult situation when Lidari's display found a football, and the man couldn't explain the find.
Moody has kept his language in which insurance companies have been charged for years and did not want a man to be affected by the activity of the accused.
"I didn't mean to stand up for it. I buried this for a long time, but sometimes it's all over again," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I must now accept the situation after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and sleep well at night.
I want to go on my way, and I want horses owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I can't continue as a horse rider anymore.
I'd like to base my future as a licensed waitress."
Moody dropped a bomb earlier in the challenge of Racing.com, where he told the charity's insurance companies on his loan.
"Six months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and offered a job to a certain man to watch my work. Tell him his name," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a liar.
If so, they should be able to present the evidence because I have not been caught by anything beyond promise.
RVL’s former president, Robert Roulston, RVL’s current president, David Moodie and RVL’s current supplier leader Bernard Saundry were aware of the operation then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal timer?
Should RVL take action and remain responsible for the situation in the field for other than manufacturers?
Am I a threat to the area?
Am I really a threat to the area?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I should still have your license and get rid of my duties, and I can't doubt that I can think of a lot of things like that.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm going to force them to make their decision.
My family will support me, and I can get rid of it."
For a long time, the study of Lidari's cobalt values and your early refusal led to the destruction of the manufacturer, so that he threatened to release his license.
Moody is best known as the perfect master Black Caviar. The man painted the day-to-day treatment rule after the horse's legs were set against the rules.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I'll take full responsibility for it," Moody said.
"The person who belonged to my personality was mistakenly lying on the leg of a horse.
We could have done some drying work last night.
It could've been done yesterday, and that's what happened.
But it happened on Friday."
Moodya may expect a three-month competition ban on the anti-hazardous treatment initiated by the organizers.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram-contained from the base of the cobram
The police have arrested the driver for a week. He's a drunk man who took me out of the parking lot.
The driver was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital, where he was hit by a heavy truck by his Murray Valley Highway on Sunday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove out of my car and didn't leave to help the wheelchair.
On Monday, at 50 years of age, a man who was home from Nathalia reported to Shepparton's police.
Men are likely to expect allegations of failure to fulfil their responsibilities in the absence of traffic accidents and other traffic accidents.
The 40-year-old driver in Cobramis's home is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm manufacturer Craig Bellamy refers to the back of the opponents' press.
Melbourne Stormer Craig Bellamy considers his team to be the critical of the Tallauspel NRL's two overarching action.
According to the founder of Sydney Roosters Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm the weight of Melbourne's ancestors to win in the courthouse in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's author Wayne Bennett was very disappointed at the reference to Stormin Bronco's battle at the casino at Queensland Cowboy's last night. He called the game a pardon and said that there was no more stress in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his team's football game and said that they were just focusing on contact.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that the two team of manufacturers criticized him for his team. Bellamy considers this evidence to be an indication that the manufacturers are worried about destroying Storm.
"This is always going up. I remember Trent Robinson didn't talk about anything when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
Because we have not changed in our defence system or in our technology all year round, we have only spent the last six weeks on contact boards and taverns, which has made us grow.
Trent's been in charge for three years.
It is interesting that the same thing is always going up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy didn't agree with Bennett with what is interesting about football. He reminded the mentor that Bennett St. George-Illawarra Dragons won over in 2010 playing soft football.
"Wayne is talking about an interesting football.
He compared his own team's Sunday game to our traditional game and considered their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St. George got a lot of criticism of part of his work. Wayne said that the rating doesn't stop him.
Now he has a group that can play so called football, especially his young, fast central player.
He wants to play this football when the player's arsenal is like this.
He emphasized this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play his style. All teams don't have central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I am given more self-confidence when other manufacturers are concerned about my team being so worried and secure.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about meeting us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more land was made in Storm and Rooster's games than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the end? 16-12?
The end of our game was 20–18. We had more situations in our game, but is it an interesting football?
Or are they toys and low-favoured football?
I think that's interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend because the group will be allowed to visit the North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on Sunday at AAMI Park.
Serbia's man free of 200 000 dollars against smoking
A man who is awaiting a trial for the possible life sentence of 40 kilograms of cocaine committed in Queensland has been released free of charge of $200,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29, was one of five men who was arrested for the last month by the police from a hundred kilograms of cocaine from the Solay ship that had come through the Old World from South America and reached Coomera in August.
The police were watching Maximovic and the crime scene during the morning session and were surprised at two of Coomera Roadhouse's coffee shop. At the parking lot, 40 kilograms of drugs were found from Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximovica may expect a lifetime drug management period for commercial purposes, according to the expert, there is no evidence that his boss would have tried to gain full control of his life, but he could have been in the coffee industry.
According to Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic is trying to escape the country.
"Maximovicil has clearly contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police at his place of residence."
Maximovic's mother and father paid together 200,000 ransoms against which man was released.
"In my opinion, the preliminary evidence of both persons is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden to them," said Judge Flanagan.
"It's not enough, however, to prevent a man from getting away," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he leaves Australia and Serbia's passport, informs the police every day and stays home from night to morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to send pictures of pedophiles
Pedophil used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to get her custody pictures where children are adopted.
Steven Hogg took the phone girl to bed and wrote to an online e-mail service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, the girl wakes up to see your phone missing, and you see it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
As she explained the contents of her phone, the girl found some shocking messages and immediately told her mother about it.
Five of these photos were reported to the police. After an investigation of the address, the police found disturbing Internet searchers who have applied for unaccompanied children.
Hogg told the police that he was trying to lead the pedophiles on the Internet and that he presented the police with the aim of threatening the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilyh Robertson at the local court of law at Dundee Sheriff Court stated: "The man claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had committed a murder on the computer, but he claimed that he was doing this to introduce the police and thus be afraid of pedophiles.
Hoggil was interviewed by an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and who had asked Hogg for more pictures.
Hogg said that his purpose was to lead the pedophiles into the race.
He told me that he was getting disturbing thoughts at lunch and that he wanted to look at images of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "Let's find out the messages from my phone, the girl's voice to her mother with great tears and tears."
The girl saw inappropriate images on the phone, and then Hoggia was heard.
The girl told the accused computer and the Playstation to talk to herself much younger than the girls.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward from Road recognized charges against unaccompanied children for the last 14 June. Hogg broke free on 25 January this year and lost access to justice for hearing on 24 March this year.
Defender Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia should not be included in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be considered that there were no significant sexual restrictions on crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael appealed to the Court in October because of the social work backlogs.
Hoggy was granted freedom of choice against this issue, but he was considered to be responsible for other reasons.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of publication of the judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has a bad speech in Parliament.
The former head of state of Africa Mugabe died in the doors leading to the talk hall this year.
Mugabe didn't get upset, but the video from what happened quickly spread into the social media.
Parliament's opening ments also voiced the claims of the opposition legislators that they had received anonymous killing threats warning them to shoot Mugabel during his speech.
In the last month, the representatives of the House of Presidents held the same debate on the situation of the President's state in the middle of the afternoon.
The MDC movement for Democratic Change (Innocent Gonese) mentioned the texts of the seven opposition policies that call for them to be free of disturbance in Mugaben's speech.
"The news has been sent out of an unknown number, but the message's title is "dead", Gonese told the suppliers after Mugaben spoke.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer within the limits of immunity.
According to police officer Morgan Tsvangir, the party's leadership is concerned about the threats posed by politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the reorganisation and rescue operations of the business service.
HP will divide into two Persian companies later this year and separate computer and output transactions from faster growth of business equipment and service activities.
According to HP, the company will write an estimated $2.7 billion, double-cost from the fourth quarter of the year.
"Renewable arrangements will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost-effective structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP supplier Meg Whitman, who leads the company after its division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a wide and heavy portfolio of business activities that help companies move into a new type of business." Whitman said.
"Our own company's position is better than ever and we can better respond to the needs of our customers that have changed the world."
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual business exchange is over $50 billion and the company concentrates on providing unique integrated technology solutions to businesses according to its mission.
Stanford University grew up in Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s. Both of them were based on the car that is now known as the birthplace of Pilaiakso.
There have been massive reorganisations in HP when the traditional table data are being transferred to mobile devices.
Second, the changes in HP of the world's largest computer manufacturer and the largest technology companies in the United States are a new transition in the field of which it is believed that focusing on this success.
Arsenal Captain Michael Arta: The group must support Jack Willshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Willsher that it's only September. If all of us are planning a rescue plan, there's no reason why he can't go back to the field in December.
The best possible scenario means that Willsher will certainly have to leave between at least four of the following games in England, and his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear in the hours of a man's history.
The biggest problem of the last time is that Willsre decided the last time he was stronger and seemed to return to his former home under a new era.
"The other waves don't threaten the bear," Wenger said.
"God didn't get better.
That's not a serious problem.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't connected to her noses or more of her noses."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wengerkin pointed out, more may come when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the day.
This is also the subject of unfavourable regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different problems since Wilshere debyed six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal River only in 65 of the total 157 over the last five years.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that between 2007 and 2008, between six and eight groups have been the second most affected by the dropouts of the lost groups.
Wenger agrees with the possible nodules, but Arsenal believes that the last improved dementia statistics will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes after a relapse, a period of time that can be affected may be associated with the return of the victim, where the body must be strengthened and the seeking of competition authorities," Wenger said.
"Jack's a young man, so he's gonna figure this out.
I hope he gets his body weight. I believe in it, and because of it his urine continues to be the one he deserves."
Arsenal begins his conquest of the Masters on Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the group will meet in the morning of Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger prepares small changes to the assembly.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely starters.
Wenger can also hold an opening meeting at Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Montreal and Theo Walt.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give it time for it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clearly a member of the F-group, Maximir Zagreb has the most fear - inspiring stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unsuccessful for a team of 41 games.
Stadionia was treated on Tuesday morning when the country collapsed at 3.2 Richter's level.
The result was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned to be like Monaco after his last visit, and he has also given a long hope for the trust of the group towards European masterhood.
"We have a huge amount of energy," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet received this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic in terms of experience.
We're honored, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendships between men
The same description is highlighted by removing other rows, especially when it is noted that the need for men to open is greater than ever and the suicide rates for young men are higher than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was one of the most important deaths of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom.
Campagn Again Living Miserrably (CALM) is struggling to publish for the year 2015. The campaign seeks to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking their help.
Friendship is the main idea of challenges.
In a recent study, 2 000 individuals were challenged. According to the study, there are better possibilities for improving the risk of malnutrition if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of ill health was also upheld if there were people who did not have mental health problems near them.
However, there is a relationship between friendship and friendship.
The current message dominates social media, and the message type is often more important than important contacts.
As a result of digitalization, the need for strong, bold and successful action has been doubled despite the fact that separation is real.
The values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success come from outside. They all take into account internal values and natural personal growth and friendship. Internal values affect our mental health.
A million players in a video game recently claimed that money can't really buy happiness.
Freddie's beauty was that the line turned to the top of the point.
No one in the line was defined professionally but according to personality. This was seen in friendship.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were humorously presented on TV or on TV. We also saw Ross often kissing Rachel. It was clear that men were able to do this even though they didn't have to be fully aware of it.
One volunteer explained to me this: "When I listened to tired and suicide victims, I was able to see how many of my best friends' smaller reactions can be significant.
The men who communicate with us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men belong to a cross is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frend is one of the series where long-term recovery mechanisms are presented.
The series highlighted a few moments of friendship between men.
Through the phone I can offer help from outside at an unexpected moment, but long-term support will be received from friends and family from the point of view."
Comedy Central FriendsFest's honor of the series has been raised in life. So if they participate in this weekend, please encourage them to bring their friends to Central Perki.
Or do something better... smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
Never know how important a friendship can be lost.
Comedy Central sends the whole spectrum of Friends – all 236 sections – #FriendsFest to honor
Di Marian's husband helped PSG cook Malmön
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matutid and Edinson Cavan against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting a Master's obstetrician and helped PSG to beat the Swedish team as Malmö's aunt.
Read the report and the evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in prison when Paris Saint-Germain began his work on the Masters' way through the Malmón Park des Princes stadium.
Di Maria made a map when the Debity Game was played less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French sailors immediately at the reception. However, PSG spent several lands before finally able to add its lead: Cavani ground when the game was played 60 minutes.
The A-class also have Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong base against the Swedish master. PSG not only aims to continue its place in the crash games, but also wants to improve its position in the three remaining treatment for the quarter.
Although the SPG hit points, the take was not a perfect show for Laurent Blanci's trusted team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic broke down the ground floor and had to change when he was against his former home, where he started his dirty career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or at home, so 2–0 winnings and good winnings give us a good foundation, even though we still have a long way to go," Blanc noted.
"This knows well.
We were able to win, and we were able to do it. I am sorry we couldn't go to one or two extra countries."
Ibrahimovic returned to the group after his release. The group had to meet for a week at the 2-2 level in the League 1 series of Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in four minutes.
In the last month of Manchester United from the PSG, the Argentinian League was named the PSG's solution that raises the group to a new level in Europe. She proved to be a valuable name in her appreciation for Marco Verratt's food at the end of Malmö's defense, and then she signed a contract to return to the end of Johann Willand.
However, those waiting for PSG's execution had to be mistaken.
Malmö has appeared in Celtic's puzzles, marches into the field from the start of the ninth international level. A team of five men's defenses and two attackers' tactics was difficult to overcome.
Nikola Djurdjic's escape was almost over at the back of Kevin Trapp's ground at 34 minutes. The group wasn't very active.
Instead, PSG created an empty food shortage and a weak finalization, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five land areas by only the first half. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic was eating on the ground floor of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his teeth in the food matches. Ibrahimovic's diet Di Maria shot a roundabout at the end of the weekend at 52 minutes.
A second land was born during the time of Cavan. Six months later, an accomplished Uruguayan bomber shot a whole bunch when Ibrahimovic shot him from Maxwell's left armpit.
The book of Malmö was completed on another land, and only the archaeologist David Luiz of Willand's approach to shooting had to read it on board, and when Ezekiel Lavez arrived from the alternative point of view, the land was abandoned on the very final meters.
Malmö created Åge Hareide after he admitted that PSG was his own class. "We saved the previous Masters' game in December last year.
After that, we've only been scared by Sweden, where there's no level.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This was their best shot."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in share
The Swiss coal miner Glencore, whose prices of raw materials were tested, collected 2.5 billion dollars a week as part of its debt reduction strategy.
In its opinion, Glencore, who was listed in London’s wallet, stated that he sold new shares of about 1.6 billion pounds to reduce debts.
The market value of the company dropped by 57 per cent this year. The company suffered a price decrease in raw materials when the Chinese economy was affected by demand and market difficulties.
Because of the share of Glencoren, I went to London in the middle of the morning to start in the middle of the morning.
The share increased by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pens in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent.
In the last week, Glencore announced a total of $2.5 billion as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of $30 billion to the third.
The company sells new shares at 125 pounds price, which is 2.4 per cent of the total closing price.
The company accounted for 1.3 billion shares, with a common value of up to 9.99 per cent of the entire group.
Concerned about the continuation of the Chinese economy, it has been worth half the price when the decline in oil, copper and other benefits has been 20 to 40 per cent.
White house to strengthen Xi Jinpingin Washington
The White House, published in its publication on Tuesday, states that President Xi Jinping is travelling to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive at the first official visit to Washington on 25 September, where the opposition is directed by President Barack Obaman's visit to Beijing last November.
Following the bilateral discussions of Heads of State, the United States President and Vice-President Michelle Obama will arrange for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Lyuan, to celebrate the evening of the state election.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping will allow for increased cooperation between the United States and China in the areas of global, regional and bilateral issues that are of interest to many parties. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have an opportunity for constructive discussions that are unique," says the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February, and he is expected to meet several U.S. technical leaders in Seattle.
Obaman and Xin are expected to take up a number of controversial issues, such as the claim by Washington that China is free of cybercrime and the increased activity of the country in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in the film industry
Matt Damon had a strong discussion with an African Effie Brown and said that he didn't need the diversity behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday evening, the exhibitor interrupted Brown when this explained how important it is to take into account the different views on the dark core of the project's selection.
"The diversity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon said.
Brown was quoted as a tyrant and a coward. "Wauu, of course," said the woman after Damon's comment on the picture.
Damon and Brown had met with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finals of the case.
"Whoever is a leader, I would like to encourage you to consider how harmony's fraud is presented," Brown noted at the outset.
"The only dark smile is a prostitute who has sex with her white partner."
Dear White People's film producer Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancacciato supported the film's director. Damon was pleased that both choices could lead to an unmanaged final outcome.
When the debate was on television, the social media was exposed to Damon’s negative comments.
The Twitter user Mr.Pooni expressed his ability to address him directly and said: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks only of a dark person to explain what the diversity is is is is so emphasised on whiteness that it makes it hard."
Twitty was divided into more than 5,000 times, and it was divided into 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the equal representation of people in the media is a common topic.
After young Michael Brown died from the creation of a white police in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement was sustained by the country. The movement is trying to stop the treatment of the dark sections of legislators and authorities.
In February, the psalmist Prince referred to the movement in his presentation of the annual albums in Grammy.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"I'm still interested in albums, like books and dark life."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement would publish an opinion in response to the question of whether the group should become an angry group.
"The Black Live Matter network is a love-based group," the leader of the movement said.
Damon is one of those enthusiasts, producers and mediamologists who have been invited to the pope’s class to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
I don't know if Damon has responded positively to the call.

The first American Ninja Warrier's prize was held on Monday and won millions of dollars by the professional and professional director Isaac Caldiero.

"The amount of victory is incredible because I have never earned more than $10,000 a year," he said in his E! challenge.
"Now, I can't even imagine what the future will be all about."
The producer in question, Kent Weed, told The Hollywood Reporter about the fineness and why Britain is not paid, even though he was the first competitor who has solved all the tasks.
"In accordance with the rules, you will soon win your salary.
If more competitors figure out all the tasks, they'll soon win," Weed explained.
"Employment is such a wonderful and enriching life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from doing it.
I don't think he's gonna bury it any more.
He's just satisfied with his performance.
He's got a lot of public stuff from the fans.
Britten is a great guy whose family matters.
His child and his wife consider him a saint.
Geoff told me that because he didn't win it himself, he just didn't like Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him the same way if your situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for eight months, starting in May 2016.
