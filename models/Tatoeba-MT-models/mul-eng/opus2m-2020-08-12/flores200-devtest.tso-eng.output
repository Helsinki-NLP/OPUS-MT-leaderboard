When a small group of living things (unwanted things) are separated from their own, (such as if they were from a mountain or some other cave, or to a new island to return easily) they are accustomed to finding them in a different location than they were before.
The new environment is different from that of various competitors, so new animals will need different things or adapt to conditions in order to compete with or demand the excess energy that they once had.
Ancient animals have never changed, yet they still need to be familiar with the same situation.
In time, as animals arrive in contact with their new habitat, they begin to be slightly different and different.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, two groups will appear to be so different that they can be called different groups.
These systems are called speciation, which means the creation of new creatures. Speciation is an inevitable return and is essential to the theory of evolution.

Moreover, failure to do so has disastrous consequences: there is no further, no more famine, and finally death.
Plants ready to be found would be proteins on leaves and leaves, but they are too heavy for animals like us to eat unless they are cooked
On the other hand, animal food (animals, eggs, and eggs) not only is not limited to cereals but it also provides a large amount of protein containing essential acids.
