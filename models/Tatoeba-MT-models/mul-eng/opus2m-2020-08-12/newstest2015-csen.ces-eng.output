Peter Chech: Move to the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big move.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr Chech, currently a replacement banker of Chelsea, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
It sits in the funny NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and comes close to the Czech representation of the American hero and then to the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, in the new season Premier League is awarded the privilege of Thibaut Courttois, Czech first in ten years in the London club.
In time, it was calculated that Chech could be interested in Real Madrid.
In the beginning of the season, the Spanish Superpohar lost in battle with the Athletics and did not even enter the hospital season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about Paris SG's interest.
In the season, the French League stood for two victories and two remises, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively, the most pressing bota club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance in his league and he broke up with Lille at 1:1 a.m. on the weekend.
On Bulgarian English Web sites today, the news was that Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, the Czech departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not too likely.
Skibet wrote a course on it at 4:1.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your dress in the past few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a percentage in the football.
Maybe there'll be an offer that won't be refused during the day.
How should such an offer look?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how an offer that she can't refuse looks like.
It would have to come to the agreement of all parties. Firstly, it would depend on Chelsea's existence if he could solve any offer from the club or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a move when you're in Prague now?
Would it not be necessary for you to sign a new contract in a new way?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are many players today, all of them at some point in representative races, and of course today there are still a lot of crimes to be done.
So it's kind of realistic.
How many are on the planet of clubs that could allow you?
Well, I don't really know.
So you don't want to leave?
The situation when I didn't catch up in the first three new season is new to me after fifteen years of career.
But there's no reason to panic, to fight, and to go somewhere.
I want to take part in this file about Chelsea's position and is on the trainer who chooses which decision he will make during the following weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision-making?
I'll take all the factors into account.
It's important for me to have a sports look, but I'm also looking at the personal page where the family's needs are, of course.
Is it possible you could catch another club in England?
That's a question I thought I'd never be affected.
But it's all possible in the football.
I don't want anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karat after a motorcycle accident arrested a 20-year-old boy
The engine stopped after a maximum speed of 70 km/h reached 125 km/h and moved into the bus to unify the police.
The following morning, the transport police in Karatá tried to stop the engine at the border when they noticed that when they left the station at Bathgate Road, they were going 125 km/h.

The motorcycle was fun for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be brought before the court because of the charge of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was informed of charges during the hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
Apparently on 7 June 2013 at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire, he had to rape a woman.
According to her claim, Webster attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent."
Next is Webster aimed at rapeing another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in Scotland on May 4, 2014.
The Court of Justice Lady Rae has set the date of conversion on 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Renewal of the very American ideal that labour law is equal to human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law that has the organization of the committees to protect civil law.
"According to the way the committees work, jobs for the middle class," says Elison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired by the Congress Committee.
So I am so proud that I can, together with the example of temporary rights John Lewis, introduce a law that strengthens the employment situation.
This semi-legislative legislation gives workers the same legal opportunity to prevent discrimination when organised in committees, such as in other forms of discrimination - and to stop anti-combatants
The law on labour relations so as to enable all employees facing discrimination, if they want to join the committees, to be tried in civil courts - and to condemn damages or compensation for damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
Of course, this is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers are saying is to link again to an American ideal.
Even in the face of collective wars that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans have at times supported the country around the world to accept, expand and respect labour law.
It was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it when the country, with one breath, pursued democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to accept the proposed constitution in order to ensure that the Hideki Toja military autocratium will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their teams played a role in the formation of new Japan, included in their languages, and openly recognized that "the right of employees to assemble, collectively unite and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged Germany to create a constitution that will ensure that the Fascism of Adolf Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to be organized and promoted in the new nation and therefore included clauses that were open to say: “The right to create societies that will protect and improve working conditions and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and every call or profession.
The agreement which will restrict or force the right to damage it will be terminated; measures leading to the fulfilment of this purpose are illegal.
When former President Eleanor Roosevelt, President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, the sponsors and Roosevelt guarantee that "each has the right to create and enter into a committee within the framework of the protection of their interests."
The American entire generation accepted the fundamental premise that labour law is human rights.
When the country was working in another country, how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create working groups - and their participation in collective interaction with companies and government agencies as a balanced partner - must be protected.
Now that this right has been violated in America, it is essential to return to the American idea that working people must have the right to organise and process freely and openly.
As reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said some 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the forces of the nations have not diminished, but they have expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living for millions of people, created a market for industry, and led to the production of raw materials.
Those who attack the councils forget these simple truths, but they remember them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organization of committees - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have led to America and have made it a real commitment to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the hospital clinics in Louisiana
The Federal Court of Justice temporarily blocked a Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five clinics carrying out a state-of-the-art operation.
The Regulation was signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is to enter into force on 1 September, in order to require doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles from their practice.
The ruling of the judge means that doctors may continue to carry out legal procedures temporarily and must at the same time exercise this authorisation.
"The proposed party will be able to carry out its work legally and at the same time receive permission," said Federal Judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled for one month to allow the judge to issue a more permanent ruling on the law.
The right-of-occupation activists, who are the last in the series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain authorisation.
“Today’s decision ensures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the illegal law that they have to prepare for health and their rights,” stated Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Centre for Reproductive Law, which was intended to block the law on behalf of three of the five complaints clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision regarding two doctors who were not among the complainants was also required to grant this authorisation.
Louisiana is one of the eleven States which have adopted similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures anti-constitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Women's rights fighters, together with the United States of America's relatives and gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this authorisation is a set of requirements which are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Consumer respondents reiterated that measures aimed at protecting the health of women and some also welcomed the fact that the measure would have closed the clinics.
The Reproductive Law Centre indicated that in Louisiana only one doctor is allowed to perform losses.
If all doctors in the state had been forced to stop performing their duties, this doctor would have also stopped taking action because of his safety concerns, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities indicated that non-strengthened doctors who have lost are waiting for a legal application to be made.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, breast cancer is more common
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with her pregnant mother who died of cancer in 2007.
Women in Australian countries are at greater risk of dying from cancer than women in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with vaccines and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
According to a study by Susan Jordan of QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, women in foreign and remote areas of the state were about 20% more likely to die during studies than women in urban areas.
LITTLE STUDIA: New medicines can reduce lung cancer and
Women's researchers were following treatment for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the chance of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of vaccines, other existing disabilities and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was reached in older women with cancer diagnosed at a more advanced stage.
In women in rural and remote areas of the state, about 20 per cent were more likely to die during studies than in women in urban areas.
Although the study has not been designed to determine why women living outside the city are more likely to die of cancer of pregnant women, Dr. Jordan says that factors can be delayed diagnosis and poor access to treatment.
"It is not possible to treat gynaecologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of remote medical services, which are likely to overcome the barrier in the distance, the doctor suggested that it help strengthen transport services that will enable specialists to treat women near their homes and support programs for people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said that the study rejected that the long-term survival of women with cancer of pregnant women is, regardless of the geographically low, stressing the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.

In March 2012, a 33-year-old mother, Elisha Neave, from the city of Gold Coast, was diagnosed with aggressive form of vegetarian cancer.
Gardening centres suffer a decline in the number of owners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinarily low housing of 35-year-olds could lead to the arrival of today’s young generation of consumers of “main age groups of tenants”, the garden centres will reach up to 10 million pounds per year.
According to reports, people who have their own property will lose 55 % of the amount that will lose their residents.
As other factors that threaten the sector, which generates five billion pounds per year, indicate an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, a rise in the location of the park as a parking area and reducing the size of the garden.
In the area of Great London, where the share of the households has grown from 61% to 43% over the six years, the lowest expenditure on agricultural products in Britain is one household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society have stated that housing in the building or lack of space does not mean that people cannot plant plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener consultant for RHS, said: "For renters there is a very popular cultivation of plants in flowering plants - if they move, plants can take them with them."
The HTA report stated that the "gold age" of the rural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of households and economic prosperity from the 1980s to the 1990s.
He also foretold that this year would be better off thanks to the better time that has come after the inexhaustible conditions in March and April.
When the East dictator says democracy.
After Putin came across his youth organization, which reminds me of Hitler's greatest memory, destroyed nuclear weapons and, above all, pointed out that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a presentation on democracy today.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a Fascist state.
Great nations have one common and this is that they can be ruled by both derived nationalism and that the complex minority can be transformed into imperialist cults.
Time's going to rain on the east apparently different from the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the war on power over Europe is already long gone , in the east it thinks that the people have been oversaw for a long time and it is necessary to regain their international position.
Such oppression and frustration of the government in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis took power and then followed the outbreak of nationalism in a similar situation in Russia today.
And then the whole perfect cult of a strong leader, the hatred of journalists, the removal of unconstitutional political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals is quite similar.
Vladimír's Putin and most of the Russians are likely to suffer after Russia has ruled half of the world and the other part has fallen before them.
Maybe Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe Vladimir paid a little bit for the shoulder, maybe they didn't call him where he was investigating, and maybe they began to underestimate him and he was just acting like a typical Russian man.
He made a house order, pretends he didn't even want to go anywhere, and blew up a knife at home.
Now he decided he'd get his lost position back.
It's starting slowly, it's time.
The leader's probably on life, where he's going to run.
He sent Kavkazana, now he sent Ukrainians, and then there are a number of torturers from Pobalt.
You've been wearing a Russian bear in your skin for a long time.
This is certainly true of China, which is quite impressive, and certainly is based on the far east.
And those Germans of Vladimir are also very nice to see how well they are, and I gave them that in 45 so on the back.
That's how to make a new innovation in the Karls Warech.
It'd be a basic and ours is a lot there and how they're impressed and they're already trying to get rid of them.
But our veterans remember how they had been in Czechoslovakia.
Now I swear by their prime minister, Mr Sobotka, he's so soft, he can fight like a rabbit and I can smell this whole EU.
It'd be so much fun to jump to Russia.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as well as explosives, we use our satellites that live on their land.
The Russians are everywhere, and when they say they're impressed, they just press them there and we don't let them, we're protecting them.
And the Rus will rule again , for what he is born to.
In contrast, Europe is only as good as a proposal that proud Ivan can dance to.
Turkey was calling for an American diplomat for Spanish news
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the highest established American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activity in Turkey.
The mayor of the Bolent government said that the American charge of business and the Turkish state officials were taking the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept noted that according to documents provided by former U.S. national security agencies, Turkey was the priority target of American and British reporting services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has underlined the importance of the message and has declared that all important states are closely closely monitored.
The previous report, which also focused on Ankara by the German Reporting Service, called for a more explosive reaction to the Turkish government.
Serial Game on the throne presented other tricks fourth row
The games about thrones currently cover the episodes of the fifth series of the cultural series.
At the same time, they agreed on how the third line was formed.

Chief of Police in Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence to the Ministry of State of the Minoros State of the Ministry of Police and State of the Authority in the area of self-government of Calvia.
The director of the police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after being accused of the risers and owners of bars in an unexplained holiday district in Magaluf.
The Supreme Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into investigation after he was charged with corruption by several companies from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and night business are located in Magaluf.
According to the online journal Mallorca Diario, five prosecutors of the Mallorian Office for the Suppression of Corruption submitted evidence of police and state officials issuing evidence in the province of Calvia.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish State police because of their involvement in the charge of corruption and, together with Navarre, were heard by the judge.
The Spanish National Journal of ABC cited the restless owners of night-to-night businesses, which are considered to have a significant impact on their business.
"It's not about making money long ago, but about surviving," one of the entrepreneurs said to the court.
Don't play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the main pages of newspapers around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists appeared on YouTube, which gave oral sex to 24 men during the tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to look at the oysters and marketers in a number of holiday parties in Magabu by reducing the number of unappreciatively known alcoholic tournaments by bars.
In addition to the Playhouse Club, where oral sex was committed, it was forced to close annually and together with tour organizers after Carnage's bars to pay a fee of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is especially popular in Britain, was also a witness to many alcohol-intensive accidents including fashion-based wool known as "balconing" where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony into the hotel pool.
First spring day known as rain and storms that had an impact on the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought a winter surprise to South Australia, accompanied by a strong rain and wind that hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm track has to fit in the city up to nine o'clock in the evening and the other 6.6 mm match during the night on Sunday.
The last table was presented together with a few short cuts connected to the storm and windmills that started eight hours ago and brought almost 4 mm of wire within 10 minutes.
After a couple of hours of iron dosing arrived after the winter last week, the city’s temperature was only 15.8 °C on Monday.
It's because the storm times have contributed to the late Virginia Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was to arrive after 19:30, but at a short distance it was forced to change the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to withdraw.
Air raids at the airport in Adelaide reached the ground at about 50 km/h.
The flight data indicated that the aircraft had to leave the second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently led to the delay of the following years, including the flight of Emirates from Dubai and the flight of Qantas from Sydney.
According to the forecast, a maximum of 16 °C will be reached in the afternoon temperature in Adelaide and one or two crossings may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from the area near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they spent years in anti-bomb shelters, while rockets and mines were attacked in their homes during the 15th war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remained closed while the country remembered the wars.
The start of the school brought to the community of South Israel the marked attacks of joy and excitement, but the signs of war are still sharp.
In Ashdoda, a city in the south of the country, the school staff who attacked the rocket took away the rest of the building after the quake and were allowed to wait for the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're happy," said Ronit Bart, a native of Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, made it "it's a little special" to go back to school once again.
"We've been through a few difficult moments and haven't even left the house," she said.
Kibuc, who is near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the citizens.
Until the end of the last week of the war, thousands of border residents like Saad remained inside their homes or homes and fled to safer areas from Gaza to avoid rockets and mines.
Many of the residents of Nachal Oz, near the border with Gaza, where she shot a four-year-old boy, with a return of weight.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families had not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in a boarding school.
The president of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was heavily occupied by a Palestinian palace.
He offered children to study fully and added, "We will provide you with education and security."
Israel and Hamas made an agreement on a temporary peace.
The ceasefire led to the immediate end of the war, however, did not solve key problems such as Hamas' requirement for the end of the Israeli-Egypt Gaza block and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the army of Hamas and the repatriation of two soldiers who fall into battle.
It is expected that a new round of indirect meetings will begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN in the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians died, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts this number and estimates that at least half of the murdered were radical, although there is no clear evidence for this claim.
On the Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza have been shot during the wars in Israel’s cities, particularly in the south of the country 4,591 rockets and fired from mines.
The Israeli army once again carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks have either damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and some 250,000 people have been covered in hundreds of UN schools that have changed into temporary shelters.
Because of tens of thousands of people who are still in hiding, and because of the ongoing wars, school officials were suspended last week in the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that they will open the school soon so that we can complete the same education as the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Muhammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind the Vachou.
Lafatu’s Heat
This morning in Prague, the Czech football representation met with the US and the next initial impact on the qualification of Europe's skills against the Netherlands.
Of the three-year-old frame, David Lafata has problems with support attacker who suffers from heat.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players and David probably got a little more of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right first," said coach Paul Vrba to reporters.
"If it's two or three days or it's gonna be fit tomorrow, it'll be seen according to his health status, which our doctor will decide about," he added.
The other players are okay.
"Of course someone has some disease, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a game between the United States," said a Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan Founder of Lukaše Vach.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision, given the presence of other MEPs.
I decided on the basis that Lucas is a prospective player, 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand for it," Vrba said to Vach.
What about Shural?
We'll see what's going on with Latatou.
It is not excluded that, in the case of health problems, nomination could still be changed.
On the weekend, there was a great performance, for example, of the liberarian Joseph Shural who gave a hattrick.
Of course, there are players who show form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata's gonna be doing.
In case it is not possible to be in the middle available, I do not claim that I can't name any of the players involved in the Czech league," said Vrba.
This afternoon, the trainer's representative is waiting for Strahová, and on the afternoon of the classic pre-school train before the United States due to the summer, which will be opened for fans and followed by the autograph.
A relationship with the Americans is playing in the middle of 20:15 and a national team in it will strive for the prime win under Vrbo.
In the previous three ready-made game he won two remixes and once lost.
The qualification file with the Netherlands is then on programme 9 September from 20:45.
Dogs go to the Netherlands to Italy
It's a pleasure to have more time for training than before.
It's good if you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things we didn't have much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing ourselves for the best in the Netherlands," Wrba said.
The Dutch will be present in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will be personally monitored by the former former representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a tape and we're gonna get him out of here.
A new coach will come to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba told bronze medalists from a recent world championship.
According to closely followed statistics, the price of housing in the winter period has grown to the greatest extent over the last seven years.
According to the hotel price index in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic grew in July at 1,1 % of the housing price, at the agency's Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in red, red and sorghum by 4.2%, the highest in winter since 2007.
The annual increase in prices increased by 10,9 %, more than doubled by one year until August 2013, but the profit was not balanced in the country.
The RP Data Tim Lawless research director stated that Sydney and Melbourne are on the market.
The RP Data figures show that the prices of apartments in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Among the most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an increase in prices between five and six per cent.
On the other hand, Canberra was placed at a level which damaged the State’s cost reduction and where prices increased by only 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that, as soon as it became clear, the number of real estate on sale increased in the following months, which will be a "real test".
"In view of the sustainable high rate of auction products, generally high sales speed and low rate rates, it is likely that the value of housing will still increase over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never beat me.
He never told me "I like you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven Japanese immigrants in Dudley in Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry tries comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4.
Soundtrack is mixed reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to consult with some unpleasant memories from childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "constitutional" therapy and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice saying: “Stop being afraid.
Leave the sister alone.
Get out of here!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton--when I was a child, they were already adults--they went to the bar with him and searched things like the shape of a bead with a beer or the beauty of the touch in the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life was a big guy in the corner reading the newspapers.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley in November, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he saw what life had to be for him.
Today there's more light than ever, but it's still dark, burned, dirty labyrinth where the flames blow up and there's a lot of smoke and soap.
Dad always walked out and just lay there, and then he heard how he started singing for himself, because he smiles from himself.
When I went around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I started to think more about him.
Even though Henry lived as a child without parental love.
Dad didn't kill anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When Mom was sick and died, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who's with Dawn Frank, has made him feel the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with "I like you"?
Don't worry about me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn Frank.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
It's great, Mom.
With Frank, who was married for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of stress and symptoms of diabetes began to show up, the doctor said to me, "You have to make radical changes."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I had to keep a drastic diet in order to get rid of my prizes.
It's very hard.
It's a surprise.
No one wants to eat the same brand.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After he got recognized from his criticism of Othell, he went to the theater.
She was following Comedy's mistakes and the August Wilson Lots.
It's a different experience than the satcoms and comedys that filled his hettic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ looked at him on the way someone was born and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-70s: "I've been the only black imator/committer on television for a long time."
He learned to walk.
In addition to having to pay attention to my public opinion, I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to imagine the performances, be a star and show on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
In view of the fact that his manager had the right to produce the Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program where the Herpes had moved into the Blacks, Henry finally released his comedy five years later.
That's why my family was already mine.
I'm a little worried it never happened, but I don't hate it.
Even though it was a special and painful position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the tax.
What was "years and years the main product of British television" was also "the big black parody."
In the 1980 ’ s, Henry worked in alternative comedian circles and presented posts that also laughed and praised British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to be sent in 1984 and in the 1990s he was also known as chief of the Chief of Staff, Garreth Blacklock in the Comedial Series of Chief!
The next decade, he was taken by advertising, documents, television series and role in movies, but after his movie show LennyHenry.tv on BBC in 2008, he said, "As you're going to do now, Lene, it seems like you're stuck in one place or a bit out of the way."
Next on the series was the documentary series on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
It was Shakespeare's first.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't study him properly at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
All the people we've been talking to in this class, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Denchová, said, "You should try it."
Don't worry about what you're talking about if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all like Shakespeare.
Henry presented the document with twenty lines from Othello's final words and was already in it.
It made me feel like I can prove it.
It'd be like it'd give me a lift.
"That's it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was tough, and before I read this game, I read it for months and months.
And it was a success.
Looks like they're waiting for requests that didn't happen.
Soon he started to play in Comedi with all his mistakes.
I was in the National Theatre all the time, I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical competition, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the entertainment of the public.
"The voice in my head said to me, 'Before the computer can fix it, you must have it ten minutes now."'
Instead, the director announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went out of the closet and something was said to me, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can fix it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Learning the Platonic text was a challenge.
Panika's pretty good, it's making a decision.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like God's sign saying, "You should do this."
Of course it's called by the SUSTAINABLE voice.
So I'm staying at it.
I really like it.
I'm glad to try.
Henry, however, remains the brain of the comedian – our conversation has been interrupted by humorous exposure when he enters and out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to stand-up, because having peace from the room of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into the dark street.
Sometimes, if I want, I'm doing Live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy as I used to.
I asked myself if he ever even organized some stand-up tournaments.
The joy of sitting in one room with the director who helps to draw up the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
Here's what I'm doing.
It's fun.
You'll always tell stories that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to shine on non-existent employees
Kenya started with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove from the government's payroll of non-existing employees.
According to the government's declaration, employees who are not registered within the next two weeks will cease to receive payment.
The government is expected to pay thousands of people even after they have left the state service.
After taking the office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged that it would include corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state is coming at least one million dollars (700 000 pounds) per month at the expense of non-existing employees and other use of official power.
The government suspects that payments are still on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee has left the state administration, the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanwa Chebusiri.
All state officials shall be provided to the identification centres within the next two weeks where their biometric data will be recorded in the government's declaration.
It goes on to say that anyone who doesn't get enough excuses will be removed from the payroll.
"The evaluation of actual public services will significantly contribute to its economy and will also be used to clean the payroll at both levels of government and address the problem of non-existing employees," said Anne Waigur, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Ten Turkish police officers were arrested for "smoothing" against the government
The local media state that Turkey has been detained because of the suspicion that 33 police officers have been "indicted against the government".
The police office has not commented yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, fourteen high-ranking officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation of corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
Several Turkish police officers were arrested in July for data organisation of criminal gangs and phone calls.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time of the president of the government) marked their behaviour as part of the influence of Islamic spiritual Fatullah Gülen on him and others in power.
Not all children returned to Ukraine to school
Most schools in Ukraine opened again on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents and the president of the government of Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion he informed the journalists in question that not all schools were reopened but that the country was determined to defend for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
Not all of Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, a united Ukrainian front, has to fight for peace.
Alex Pastukov, a teacher at the school in Slavjanska, who visits Jacenók's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children dressed in raised shirts, bringing balloons and teachers flowers.
In Roño Fairhead maybe BBC found a boss for difficult times
It brings with it a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conservative parties.
She's got her own experience with the front lines.
She started her career in the consultancy company Bain and Co and then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and to the media world of Pearsons.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years, and she refused to do so when she had the highest role in Pearson's parent company.
It's said that her resignation was nearing a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also wide.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed a private expertise: he became the government's consultant.
Her husband was a former member of the City Council.
In May I described the director's work as a cake with food.
Not only that BBC is a broad and interdependent entity in the centre of public life but also has an internal paradox in its structure.
Corporations are facing two directions: inside the top hierarchy of their own BBC management, but also outside the public voice at times when things do not work.
It's almost non-sustainable monopol, which requires a thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming to a company that is composed of Chinese dynasties, disbanding it and preparing for work himself.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would like to see how BBC is reducing - its power, its finances - and how it is revising its status.
As competition is widening and new technology doubts old security, an immediate agreement on concessionary payments for BBC is a major danger.
According to a modest portion of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public buys part of something that is certainly the largest media business in the world.
The BBC reports a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and that it is only 40 pounds per day.
In addition to the BBC figure, it is obvious that 53 % of the purchasers were around 31 % 10 years ago.
The use of BBC services changed: Today, I can look at iPlayer on my mobile phone and on the order I've been through.
But BBC still remains a very loving and wonderful institution.
He needs a great director - I hope she found one.
The Texas Governor Perry says the offensive tweet didn't approve
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained a shocking picture of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and was published on Perry's account next time he was away from the past.
My account left a tweet that wasn't authorized.
"I don't agree with the tweet and stopped it," he added.
Perry's assistants didn't answer any questions right away.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his management.
Previous tweet published an unliquidative, humorous picture of the state representative Travis County Rosemary Lehberg, who was considered to be in April 2013.
When she refused to give up, Perry refused to pay for her office, which Perry, a potential candidate for the president in the 2016 elections, brought this month before a large court in Austin.
The post said: "I don't always drive more than three times the amount of alcohol in my blood than it's allowed to limit... but when I'm done, I apologize to Governor Perry that he asks me to take responsibility for it."
I'm the best Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry didn't lead to Lehberg's office.
He was worried about Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and accused of being a tactical, political manoeuvre.
His qualified legal team requested a judge to review the case to refuse the charge because the use of the laws to bring to justice the most useful governor in the history of Texas is counterproductive.
Perry cancelled the payment of $7.5 million from the state fund for the division of public interest interest which is located in Travis County and close to corruption in Texas after Lehberg refused to refuse.
The refusal resulted in formal difficulty in the left-hand side of a group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's celebrated.
After finishing his presidential campaign in Ioë in 2012, Perry responded to the speculation that he could already finish his own photo as he ran near the lake and said, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the market with housing returns "to normal"
One of the most prominent London developing companies has ensured that the market with housing in South-East England "returns" to the normal level of activity.
Accommodation in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and increased concerns from credit institutions were accepted by the Bank of England in June to set limits on mortgages.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the development company for client customers in Berkeley, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 has returned to the normal level of transaction." He adds that it provides "a stable environment for operation."
London's housing market was very good during the collapse because customers from foreign countries had moved to the main city.
According to the disaster agency's data, prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the last year, leaving an average of 6.7% in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley last year amounted to about five and at the end of the year, to 423,000 pounds.
However, in recent months for foreign purchases of London property are not so attractive - some of them have also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and the possible "dwelling taxes" that policies have come before the elections of the next flower.
The London real estate office Foxtons warned last week that a thorough market review with mortgages, which represented stricter rules for loans, will also decrease during the second half of the year as well as the pace of market growth in real estate sales and prices.
The new bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages in June, which means that the housing market is declining.
Hamptons International, another realistic office, has fallen on the basis that domestic prices have already begun to decline, predicting the increase in prices of London's properties by 3% by 2015.
The volume of transactions according to the actual WA Ellis office in London's most expensive quarters, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, decreased by quarter each year.
However, the demand for housing in the main town for Berkeley was a blessing because it increased the readiness for a forward sale of more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: "The recovery after the right, well-being accommodation in a good location remained the same, and this led to a long-term sale."
In June, the company reported that from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, 3,742 property was sold, almost three times as high as before the crisis in 2007.
The annual income before tax increased by 40% by 380 million pounds, by 18% by 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before the production year, Pidgley said it is expected that the annual profits of Berkeley will be in line with the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
Berkley's shares ended on the London Bridge at 23.96 pounds.
Hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrenc's naked house on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrenc will be attending the 85th Annual Price Academy.
The photos of Oscar Jennifer Lawrenc's holder were on the Internet because of hacker who claimed to have a "list" photo of other hundreds of earlier hijackings.
The talk stars of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that the photos of the Lawrencs were right and hacker criticised "public abuse of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will catch up with anyone who stole the photos of Jennifer Lawrenc's public.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the server for sharing 4chan images are probably obtained by measuring in the applu iCloud web site system. A reliable list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanny, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, yet the film star "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticised the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who look at the photos we had with your husband years ago in private homes are at peace," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice is known from the series of cable televisions Nicoladeon "iCarly" and "Victorious" that the photos would be true. On Twitter she said, "Here are my personal photos, people."
It's better to wear it out in the gap.
Bizzfeed announced last night that he was speaking about Aryan Grande's golden stars saying that the accurate photographs would be true.
Extraordinary evidence from the famous new novel Howard Jacobson on love and letter "J"
They were released, it's the best way to describe it. They gradually spread out like cardboard boxes that someone left on the rain.
Just a while ago, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, smart, isolated and maybe a little excited.
And then she gave him her hand.
He's slowed down.
He was able to bite like a snake, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a loving cry that promised him more than usual that he would be relieved of his personal troubles and perhaps give him some relief.
Ailinn Solomon's was a Greek beauty with a wild red hair and a flying heart from the village on the north island, which was even cheaper and more hospitable than Port Reuben.
The older company that Kevern thought was her aunt who gave birth to her property in a tender but beautiful valley called Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The drums caused, there were dead rattlings on the outside, the drummers signed on the window, as if they thought that this place belonged to them, the garden was grown and the dust reminded the huge heads of wish.
The house seemed like a little boy from the children's stories, terrible and even confusing, full of secrets.
The author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the front list at the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The next week, the election will be announced.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the long grasses and held their hands, enjoyed an unexpected warm spring afternoon, and immediately set up a public station, which the country enjoyed a pleasant music and calming message, as he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black comec, which his father gladly listened to for the long time.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played on radio.
They were not banned - they were really banned - they were just playing.
They helped them get to the 10th, just like the 10th word itself.
Human experience has demonstrated what would never have been proved by laws and regulations outside the law, and just like people who choose books, they choose memories that become rich from poverty, cooks and merciful Romans, so they choose ballads in music.
Kavern was allowed to get out of the day and started playing on an imaginary piano and a funny, funny voice singing the Aillin's series with big walkers.
Non-capable article.
"It was a favorite song from the fashionist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically added two fingers to his legs.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to pull the letter J before he got out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that the game was playing with his father.
When you were in the words that started on the j, you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it was your money.
This time it wasn't very funny and it wasn't even now.
He just knew it was expected from him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
No jazz, even though he wasn't directly established outside the law, they didn't play.
The improvisation came from fashion.
There was only one place in life if it was.
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know where she was going to end up.
It's the same in the mood.
His improbability went to people on the nerves.
And Jazz was an expression of humor.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior for up to ten years, Kevern knows jazz from his father's old CD flight collection.
At least I couldn't tell Aillin that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she could not remember the time when the favorite singers were not black.
No laws or pressure.
A voluntary company is the one in which each part of it is grateful - thanks to those who were a happy means of saving - agrees with the principle of group appreciation.
People of African-Carab origin walked with temperatures and constitutions for spring and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, such as the natural supply of electronics, assumed responsibility for that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles that were left were the installers, the Greeks who were left, the liars.
Those from the states of the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose ancestors quickly left the country, while doing what STALO, KDYBYY THIS STALO - feared that they would charge them for joining the fire, actually feared that the fire would last for it - opened up a restaurant where they sold their lungs and smoked their water bottles, ignored themselves and the inactivity was a little scary.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she was listening only to the ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the simple words Kavern just sang could produce music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not actually free," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of security.
After the sound records, he couldn't even avoid a word.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to give up two fingers in her presence.
You already thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he finally said.
Unbelievably she let her head down and held Kevin's view.
There was nothing else in the whole world than the smell of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said suspiciously.
But that doesn't always explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at himself again.
She didn't walk like that.
Maybe a little bit of quacks...
You're saying you hate me because I've got too fat knights?
Do I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too fast.
"Your fat bastards just touch me," he tried.
I'm so kind.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble, because, like his father, he worked on a knife needed to be able to cut the weight she was counting on.
Maybe his father was cruel in mind.
Maybe he was mentally cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's broken down and pulled out of the toilet, agreed to radio and drank untapped wine.
No wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
Looks like it's breaking up like a palm leaf in the storm.
"I'm back in touch that you're stupid," she said...
Until it doesn't touch me.
He felt sorry for her because of her unkind words, as if she had been in her eyes at the time she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd like it?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but she didn't doubt that it was basically the same as here.
They were surrounded by the same broad and ice ocean.
The same rebellious men, then, CO SE STALO, even more impenetrable and hated than their predecessors, shepherds and punishments, were furiously blooming from the Lord to the Lord, ready to lay hands on any woman who would refuse or scorn them.
Blbec?
If he doesn't pay attention, they'll bring her their guns!
First of all, it's been the most common expression for erotic attraction between a man and a woman: a killer of soft ballads of love that protected the radio - first they killed her and then killed her.
According to Kever's view, there is a lot of culture because deception was just about the act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon's unverbalally pointed out to him to leave.
He called himself an old man.
She felt upset herself, but her quiet sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She looked at him as if she were watching him out of the window in the back of the house, the man who had decided what he had done.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
Her heart was broken because of him and because of all the men, regardless of how many of them were left behind.
The man turned away from her, the shoulder tied up, the arm tied up, the arm pulled down, all the fighting left him - why did she seem to know this view well, even though she couldn't afford the only moment until today that she'd ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomon's, himself, looked at his legs.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and inspired twelve-year research in Offnow, a non-statutory monitoring system, prepared a short article on the prevention of mild and moderate violent acts in areas of the country where its reconciliation or direct suspension was expected to be achieved if there was sufficient money and energy to be eliminated.
"It has done a lot and much more must be done," she wrote, "to calm down the angry people who fought in many wars and most of them were won, especially in the troubled, difficult places available in countries where, despite the cracks of church bonds that have emerged over the living surfaces of the human kindness of history, it has been revealed only rarely."
Some things, however, are irreprehensible.
It might seem that the higher the church rate is, the lower the floors are.
The citizens are excited about the emotional baladas, they want unhappy stories and say that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality remains the same as in urban agromerates, but evidence also shows that home, at work, on the streets and even at sports events, reveals new and aggressive hatred.
"I'm sorry you tend to be too flowery," said her superior.
I'd suggest you read less Romans.
We're Nussbaum's head.
I also need to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
"I think I don't have to answer," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you free?
We rebuilt our right to privacy and silence again.
Feminist?
Keep it quiet.
"I don't wonder why," said Rabinowitz finally, "that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have a pre-trial at this place of work.
We serve unpredictable companies.
But a certain kind of sensitivity that is simply friendly and praiseworthy can sometimes be expressed in judgment as you have done.
Obviously you are themselves predicated against the church - things that you call "cults" and "brutal" could be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Keep working out what's going on, KLYBY THIS IS STALO, as if it's happening yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
In his head on the bright table of roses, a recommendation that Offnov sent to the world in the last quarter or more.
Smile at your neighbor, listen to your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, singing is better than writing, but it's nothing better than love.
"I just understand your rewards," replied the silence Esme Nussbaum when she was sure that her superior was finished, "and I can't say that the morning didn't work out as we say it happened.
My main concern is that if we don't pay attention to this, we're going to make the same mistake that has led to what's going on.
This time, however, we're not going to vent ourselves into a relationship and a lack of trust.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the end of his fingers.
That should mean endless patience.
"You are too far away," he said, "when the steps that may have been taken and your parents may not have done, you describe them as errors.
You're too far from being talking about venting your "independence" and "independence" on others.
I shouldn't remind anyone in your place that we don't talk about "we" and "them" in understanding the past and in protecting our presence.
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that it was a time of chaos.
"During which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme quoted, "we are not innocent.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
It was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no wine that would be given to someone's conscience, there are no things that should be done, even if the arrangement was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past before we learn from it--
There's a past to forget about.
If I can add something to it--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his fingertips.
"I will take your message into account," he said and abandoned it.
On the day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcycle driver who hired her on the bike in a way that would be described as "frozen and brutal."
There's an accident.
The Army of the Kingdom of Lesotho claims that no stake is planned - the president of the government remains in South Africa
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho have claimed that they would organize a coup for the purpose of overthrowing the government and claim they were acting against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Governor Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has closed his official seat and has built government buildings in the capital city of Maser.
After he declared that he was threatened by death, the prime minister took his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
Major Ntle Ntoi's army spoke of the fact that it was not a match, but the response of the army to the outbreak of "political fanatics", which the police were trying to weaponize.
"Today, this morning, the invasion of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesotho was followed by a number of information services reports that several groups in a number of police groups are going to develop some radical, political fanaticisms that wanted to be done in the country," said the Voice of America.
Speaking to South African government Clayson Monela said military actions seemed like an attempt to bring the government together.
"Because no one has declared that government powers have been seized by force, according to all the acts of Lesothic defence elements are not a sign of State return," he said.
The military representatives of the kingdom of Lesotho said that soldiers returned to their barracks on Sundays and were calm in the capital.
During Thabanov's incompetence, the Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane declared that his view was a significant attack on my efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane has stopped sitting in Parliament because of internal disputes, it is under pressure in Lesotho.
He declared that despite his misgivings, he did not undermine his government.
The euro area production is at a minimum of thirteen months
The increase in production according to the closely followed survey in July in the euro area has decreased to a minimum of thirty months.
The final index of euro area purchase managers (PMI) from the 51.8 series in July was 50.7.
Number higher than 50 means expansion.
New orders were issued and the factory damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures are from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will need a clear plan from the banks to deal with the remote healthcare of the euro area and the threat of inflation from 0,3 %.
It was estimated that, this week, ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated that he is considering the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States had entered into during the financial crisis.
"Because at least some growth is better than no growth, the rapid effect of the growing economy and the geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, the main economy of Markit.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51,4 per month.
In the second largest economy in the region, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
The concern is about France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs of the decline in the growth force in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have disappeared, too, are not too comforting," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to lead to a fire by analysts awaiting the implementation of other exchange or tax incentives.
A positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where SMEs grew to 57.3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economy in IHS Global Insight, said: "It's the best thing to say about the production review of Serbian sales managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Eurozone producers have a very complex life at present because increasing geopolitical pressure - particularly between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to the urgent conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty of trade has been demonstrated - and above all, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be dropped or even cancelled, mainly the costs.
He pointed out that as "more likely" it is that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten Years of Corporal Life in Beslan: Ten Years of Affiliated Schools Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals at school in Beslan in southern Russia were held by thousands of people
During the three-day period of torture that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims that survived the death of the animals in school.
Just ten years after the terrible concentration of schools in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, died, were warned by survivors of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
On September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorist children and parents were murdered, and it seemed like the most deep bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy combined east and west, which led to this disastrous accident to a meeting and a future.
After ten years we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims that died during the school animal.
We've found wonderful young people who have caused an accident, even though the memory of the terrible terrorist in them will continue to live.
What is their greatest hope?
So that the war that now destroys Ukraine - and the children that they were dying - is over - is over.
A girl trying to get back into the destroyed school gym
She was captured by the former Russian photographer Dimitria Beliakov, as only in the basement she tries to get back into the bombed school gym after the bomb exploded in her.
Aida suddenly looked for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They were worried that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida that time.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was saved by soldiers.
After several operations she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take another operation.
In my knee, my hair was stuck in my hair.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people like the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but she has certainly not destroyed it," she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it doesn’t change.
I'm going to the gym once a year to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
This disease is too big.
My best friend and future colleague of the JER GAPE team were killed there.
As little as we played together and we imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget her arrest, but her memories are a little sad every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet like a school window, I say that many people will see it first, understand this disaster and stop it from coming back.
A boy who avoided a lot of bullets and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at seven years of age) and he experienced a high school dropout in the care of his mother Tamary.
At the time, a seven-year-old said, "My mother told me that if an explosion occurred, I would lay down on the ground and hold her by my hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Get out of here."
He was afraid that he was dead, ran away, saw the payroll, fell behind his arm, and ran away with a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who got him out, said, "Damir told me his mother is dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara prayed for freedom and lay in a hospital with an injured stomach and, rather, thought that her son had died.
After meeting again, she said: “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hit me.
Damir then flew to London (according to missing News of the World), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, were declared a winner of Bernardo's Children.
"This threat comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that memories are already dark.
I remember right after that, I put all my guns on the counter.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with at the court and didn't get out.
We'll never say they killed her or died.
We're saying they're staying physically active.
On my trip to London, I remember very well, mostly how I could choose anything I wanted and how I ate the cabriot.
But now he's afraid of a place like Ukraine where war is suffering the same as he and his friends.
This game's coming back every day, but I'd like to stop thinking about it.
"I am very sorry for everyone who has to go through such a threat," says Damir, who participated in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want to help you so much.
I want to work with the police once and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, says: “If 37 children were killed in our neighborhood, would you imagine?
I remember that quiet right after the attack, there were no children who would scream and run here, and it lasted a few months.
He remembers living on his way to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I learned how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her assignments for the price given and for the possibility of going to London in the summer of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell myself that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste on his chest, and they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played with the guards at the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month since the threat.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and how they supported us.
She says: “I still feel that the world has not changed for the better over the last ten years.
Now there's war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it's gonna be and it'll still kill a lot of children.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people war is just something in the news that they hear when they're offered or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are living on, what the hell is that?
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed. People always want to kill each other. It's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet boy, he's not aggressive or aggressive at all.
For example, he doesn't care about the subject, he doesn't care about it.
I know she doesn't like to remember it, but she's got a lot closer to six employees and she's been going to the gym for a while and she's going to burn candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with that-- I remember how he used to look at a guy with his face turned away from us and sometimes he was so late.
He didn't sleep. He had an open eye.
I also remember that he fired all his guns or other weapons on the game.
I can't believe I've been dead for a few hours. I can't ever see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and walked out on my feet, I looked around and saw this shit, and there was a lot of human bodies lying around.
I was pretty sure my boy wasn't supposed to have this crazy chance to survive.
"I remember calling out "Damire, run, run!" but I was convinced he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life is different from that of others.
Gregory Ilyn, 17
A boy whose picture was taken after the attack became a symbol of the horror in Beslan
Escape: Survivor from Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatimou after the 2004 attack, especially Grigory today
When he escaped from life after a Chechen terrorist shot his fellow humans, his bloody face became filled with fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking animal symbols in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, took him to school on his first day and rushed to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I went two minutes before the terrorists entered the court, so my boy stayed there for three days," she recalled.
Not on our own because we had compassion there, but everyone died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As that date draws closer, it is increasingly difficult to think and talk about it.
It won't be a single day to remind us of this tragedy.
It doesn't matter to us that it's been a long time, I feel like it was yesterday, some of the moments I've been back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still going back memories: Photo Grigorie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternalized as a socha (right)
I remember how Gregory went to school that day, saying he wanted to involve his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there's even the soya of Grigory's paycheck.
Grigory looks uncomfortable on this picture and we have her stored in the library at home.
I understand this, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important not to repeat this.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the hurricanes in Ukraine.
Do we ever find out what the reason was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening because when you ask people, no one wants war as much as possible?
Ten years isn't for this kind of pain.
It takes ten years for us to forget a little bit.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
I've had three or four years because of a nightmare attack, but then it improved.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and colleagues who killed me.
So when it's close to September 1, I'm going to the gym.
I want to learn the memory of a childhood friend.
It's hard for me to get into the body, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I don't forget about that, but I don't get angry.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and began studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Gorgory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was kept in the throes of a terrorist
Surprising: Gregory Farniyev was arrested during an attack in the hands of a killer terrorist, but he was able to survive
When he was attacked in a full flood, he was caught in a physical prison as he sat next to the bomb in the throes of a killer terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's always with me, it's not something I've been holding my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can handle better - I have to say it's not true.
“In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after - this was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I'm sorry.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on this well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev today, on notebok his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
This disease is huge and they carry it with them every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee I've been injured, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn't get up and study at the FBS Academy in Petrohrad as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and told me that it was not possible.
My other favorites are animals, so I went to the hospital.
I spent the second year there.
Learn how to treat all animals from "the dog after the dog".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should live on.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This disease will continue here.
It's inside and it's getting worse with the next year.
I'll attend the Memorial.
I know Grigory's not coming.
It must be even stronger for him because he was different from me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he brought it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorie's grown up today, but he's gone.
It's hard to accept if something so terrible happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's been performing several operations, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that from 50% he'd already overcome this fear, but he won't forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and this only aggravates the pain.
I lost a lot of people I liked and they were close to me.
My son is with me and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me the loss of the dead.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life is going on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart nearly jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I watch what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The train is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could pick up all these rebels and trap them - how he didn't get it going.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who brought safety to a special command
Saved in: Alyon Tskaev leads to a secure Russian special command (left).
Now she's 10 (right) and she doesn't even remember the tragedy.
In 2004, the world was flooded when little Alyon came out of the Russian police station.
The terrorists abandoned her, however, while she was in school physically leaving her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristin and brother Makhara.
Makhar, who at the time was three years old, was single, Alyonina's mother and sister died at the time of the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and his new wife, Lightlan, has a daughter named Kristina after her daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, is not even aware of the attack and has grown up with her a strong and happy girl.
A close friend announced that "it's a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children."
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memory that he has for ten years.
You can understand why.

4 types how to manage better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in focusing or drawing under water, you have a large selection of equipment.
The most convenient option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an external camera type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is about $300.
I've arranged these photos for the family celebration of a few photos, all of them still less than $350.
It's one of the equipment you use, but to achieve the best results, you pay several rules.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are closed.
Next, set up the camera according to which type of photo or video you're going to post.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scene or current mode that optimises exposure to dark environments under water.
And before you get into it, you'll find out how deep you can stand up to your equipment.
Some cameras are only assigned to 5 degrees, other to 50 to 60.
Read our guide with the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in regular and waterproof operation.
Always take a few photos - a lot of them don't go out.
Competitive cameras have LCDs that can help you with composition photos, but they don't have it outside.
Even if you have LCD, it'll look bad under the water and the cover composition will be unpredictable.
So always make more photos.
If you have a camera with a flashing mode that makes a series of photos with a peaceful different range of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the cold.
With a deeper look of light, it's going to die.
If possible, stay focused in the pool, lake or sea near the cold.
It also allows you to capture more light on the photos - the deeper you fall, the less color you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is great advice if you take photos of the dust, but under water it is even more important because of the darker light.
This is particularly important if you touch the outside camera: Such devices usually have a strong and wide angle of the chips, which means that if you want to fill the camera, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength enabled him to change things even in such a large organization as NHS.
As anesthesiologist, he highlighted his career in order to relieve the patient from the pain caused by disability and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who were looking for his help was a MI6 agent who had to live with the consequences of the torture he had brought upon him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disability, treated patients in most rural areas are fully interested in something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in April of that year.
I felt like no energy.
He dealt with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife Juliet included exercises.
He said, "I want you to do it before you do it later."
When Juliet went out on a service trip for a week, Lawson was unbeknownst to me and apparently broke up.
Something was wrong.
His colleague made him a brain X-ray.
Two weeks ago he was lying in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
He had mesotellium, an inexhaustible narcissors, or if he's exposed to dust.
In most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was behind them.
Although some smokers will receive lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mezotelium is different.
In almost every case, it is due to the exposure of asbestos to a building dedicated material that was previously designated as “surprising”, but today it is known that it is fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore.
Azbest, the end, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when it entered into force as a ban on the use of asbestos in industry.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into contact with it, such as insulation depositors, buildings, tassaries and workers in ships.
Toxin used in the industry in another era is difficult today as a cause of anxiety.
That's self-willed, but it's not in place.
As it is shown, there is today a mesothelioma epidemic in Britain.
The number of deaths on mesotels is here higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths in this disease are twice a year more than the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma per year since 1980 and expected death in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we feel its effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all kinds of asbestos were finally prohibited by the law in 1999, is that it usually lasts for several decades before it develops.
The assembly in the form of mesothelioma is not only of the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbest was, and in many cases he is still present in the homes where we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we buy.
Mezotelium therefore does not respect social class, wealth, reputation, or age.
Privatised forests from London's commercial homes after public schools do not present a cover.
And Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the sites of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even trust isolates.
He tried to find out where he could come in contact with the asbestos.
Then he came for it.
"It is possible that there was a lot of asbestos in Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
All - students, sisters, doctors and visitors - walked.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question he could answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who have been mesotellia for the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelitis when he was 48.
When he died on 17th of this year, he had 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not normal for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
Now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: “How many of us are sick with the same weakness?"
According to former British cosmopolitan professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic occurs in Britain, about 90,000 people die.
Most of them at present have no idea that he will die in this way.
Asbesto work in Quebec, Canada
In a regular review of records of court records, where achievements are often repeated and require comparison, it shows how much the mesothelioma group has expanded.
For example, this June the company Marks & Spencer admitted that it had unwittingly exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for 19 years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched in two sales in the clothing section - one of the places was the company's trainship, the trade on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
He's got two kids over twenty today.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, but I knew something about asbestos.
I never thought in my dream he could touch me a bit.
There's not a lot of people who know anything about asbestos.
Actually, there's not one substance in asbestos, but a group of six minerals.
His name was given thanks to his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and boldness.
Three of the six miners were used in construction.
The most common today is found in buildings, often known as white asbestos.
It was used in surface panels, floor panels, baller pressures, and even in the chest.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it to be a "high health risk", which can cause death.
But it's more dangerous to be a fast asbestos (mosites) and a blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of iron asbestos and experts said that "there is convincing but undirected evidence that this was the main cause of an unusual high-exploitation mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
An employee Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a train sale at Oxford Street in London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical mesothelioma victim, but Juliana Peta's work shows that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that "the significant proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A significant part of this exhibition is done by "regular use and winding" buildings.
Looks like nobody can be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was examined by the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government must not guess that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report on the use and use of the seats of the Parliamentary Committee to be contaminated with asbestos, whose mortal flesh could be contaminated by something as harmless as a "strong flow of air."
Ministers are often accused of looking only for their own interests, but in this case it can be true.
Although Parliament's services management continued to provide the Westminster Palace with a "good medical certificate", it is now estimated that one million free and several years of work will be needed to ensure that Parliament is properly monitored, modernized, and eliminated asbestos, and that, after the 2015 elections, the delegates will be more than on the green corners of Westminster to sit in the conference centre of Queen Algebt II.
The report of Goddardu states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It's not possible to say if this disagreeable will happen.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the people who were never able to determine when they came to exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott's (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was demonstrated," she says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But clearly, she remembers the day of the beginning of December 2009, when she got something like a winter.
He was 45, he was tonight, and he was right in the middle of surgery.
I suddenly broke up.
That's what happened.
It was terrible.
I thought I wasn't coming home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming out of the trunk, around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to think he was dealing with mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
Inflammable doctors made him a chest X-ray and brought him a chest catheter to remove the fluid that they sent to his body.
They didn't have a diagnosis.
His attitude gradually improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms came back, often after he got excited and gave up.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott didn't have anything to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and he got into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his doctor consulted his CT photos and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was taken to the space between his chest condition and his lung rash was accompanied by a probe equipped with a camera.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to worry too much," she says.
To be honest, I didn't care much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, you did care.
The results of biopsy reached between Christmas and New Year's: "They told me it was mesothelial."
Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnostic
Abbott started dating sisters from Macmillan's charity organization, and one suggested that he contact the lawyer.
At the time, he was aware of the extent of the epidemic.
"It has been shown that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have a hot insulation of asbestos in the waste," he says.
In people who were exposed to these buildings to asbestos, disease is now beginning to develop.
Mezotel is now dealing with younger people who do not have a risk call.
Therefore, the most dangerously calibrated strains found in hospitals were unlikely to threaten patients.
All members of the staff who have crossed the buildings (as Andrew Lawson) by side or have eaten in the afternoons (as often as Graham Abbott) have certainly come into contact with the toxic substance.
As it is now shown, several decades after the hospital battle, there were places where patients could save their lives, but also places that could threaten the lives of doctors who treated them.
Azbest's gone today.
The bunsen's kahan was placed on the azbet floor
And it's not just about the hospital.
Azbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and workshops because of its outstanding insulation and non-pollutional properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Sometime ago, the students put Bunsen's kahan on an asbestobed floor.
Web sites that deal with the question of asbestos in schools have emerged.
Undeterred items such as floor coverings or ceilings have often included asbestos in our homes.
"It's an industrial drive forced into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, he had only contact with the asbestos that a woman suffered from mesothelium was able to remember in the 1970s when she fought a garden home.
So be careful how you fight the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while before it comes to you," says Graham Abbott.
I got back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and get rid of myself.
Well, I don't live on other Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As an uncountable number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," she says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long does it take for me?’
I was told twelve months.
I remember saying to myself: “Well, I don’t have any other Christmas.
That's it."
Mezotelium is particularly destructive because the only mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Azbez creates a small train.
When the azbek is broken and the wings are frozen, they can be placed in the basement, exposed to dust.
Azbesto's train's backyards are expensive and can cause mutations of the stems.
"The problem is that you have an axbestotic train in the shape of a needle," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiochiurg who arrived in Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is a paradoxical center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during practice in the hospital.
Abstinence is getting into the fabric of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the single breath is pushed on the edge where the exhibition is located.
His attitude has been invasive since the very beginning.
The usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much on mesothelioma.
For example, there is a debate on the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, she'd stand for a test.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the trash," she says.
You don't have enough balls to scale.
The cancer “is too inadequate to respond to chemotherapy”, which is “with some effect” but does not treat it.
"Sometimes someone who survives cancer will be released," says Treasure.
But eventually everyone will die.
The luck of some patients lives a long time than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years from his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After finding out the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and consultant for the same people.
When they called, he introduced himself, "Hello, you've been admitted to the center of cancer."
"It was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the start of Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last for four months and probably only for one month.
"I was confident," she says.
I wanted to give it up.
Lawson, however, "he could show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting a number of doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the department of brain surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the benefit of not waiting until I was sent to him, but I just called and they looked at me," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get an application and have to accept his compensation.
In order to get to the best available treatment, the question of money is key for patients with mesothelioma.
But when the various treatments end up unabated, many patients face other financial concerns - about the future of the family that they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health," Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even its very small number could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with an unsub.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital were finally finished, but Morgan said it wasn't a "full-time equation" because Lawson could not prove that mesothelium was the result of an asbestos exposure in Guy's Hospital.
However, after an investigation of the case, speecher Guy's Hospital confirmed that "debt was removed in the criminal subterranean part in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
The exposure of mortal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after what happened - has been shown to be a major problem for patients with mesothelioma which is boosting compensability.
Many former workplaces have changed their owners or have fallen into error.
The evidence of insurance is gone.
And those who are now defending themselves have their time on their side, which their claimants certainly do not.
In response to this fact, a new important legislation was adopted this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to attend to equality, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employees.
The Act created a 350 million financial reserve that builds insurance and is designed by people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no regrets.
In such a case, 80 % of the amount that the courts would normally attach to them would be equal to about 120,000 pounds.
Each year 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan feels like patients with mesothellium think 350 million is "good work".
"This is an agreement signed by insurance insurance," she says and points out that the sum is the fourth of what insurance should be paid if time and people with mesothelioma would be able to reach former employees and normally complain about them.
Even Mike Penning, former minister of work and social affairs, admitted that the law "had a mayor."
But Penning and Morgan admit that given the seven deaths each year, there was a need for urgent treatment.
"People are too patient and need help right away," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended that the operation be different from Tom Treasure, which he thought had a positive effect.
After surgery, she followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a third treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can pool up to 40% of patients.
Abbotta made it happen.
"Of course it's not the most important thing," says Abbott.
In patients you always see it.
There's something that's driving you.
When you give up, your attitude may get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott undertook an operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Control visits showed no signs of weakness.
I went to the next check in March [2014].
In my chest I had a couple of broken ribs [crowds].
My fifteen birthdays were just getting closer.
It's not a threat to life.
Take it.
Abbott once again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
At present, there are no steps in his body.
But it's physically and emotionally draining process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial insurance when I die, or about showing a woman how the living room works.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14) it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my attitude meant that I would never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Theresin is very social and strange.
She told her friends, and suddenly we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more stable.
She didn't say much.
All patients with cancer should be treated with such discussions.
In patients with mesothelioma but such discussions are not dismissed or only a sign of chance of survival.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their behavior - demonstrators promise revenge
The Chinese Parliament, despite many discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to appoint candidates to vote in 2017.
It is likely that this step will result in long-standing promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began to organize and hit only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress is essentially allowing communist leaders to organize any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it disappointed us," said the lawyer Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we have something to do with the authoritarian regime.
In the defence of the Chinese decision, the mayor of the Permanent Committee of the National Human Congress of Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain has returned to Hong Kong government in China, Beijing promises that as early as 2017, citizens will be able to enjoy executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic role because Hong Kong allows direct vote, but also makes it clear that the Chinese leading representatives are firmly in the process of appointing a committee that is closely controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months which took place in one of the largest and most followed-up protests in Hong Kong for several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are motivated by the love and peace of the Central Opposite, whose organizers threatened to close the financial quarter if Beijing does not give them general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of contractors gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong government's seat.
The organizers announced that their excitement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that protests are beginning in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In its online declaration, organizers said that the campaign "considered the occupation of the Centre only as the last step if all opportunities for dialogue were exhausted and no other choice would be made.
We must state with policy that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and Central's content is inevitable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing announcement all day and have been working to protect the seat of the government on Sunday and have placed the police and the barracks.
The fact that many Hong Kong residents are suffering from a lack of control over the city is a sign of a lack of control over the city.
The presence of strong people increases competition in the areas of products and services.
They are also concerned that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being pushed up by pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticise the occupation of Central and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a rescued member of Hong Kong.
"The protest which he is talking about could cause much more economic damage than how many people are involved and how long," says political Regina Ip, which is long critical.
We don't want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such attention could damage investment.
China's state media have also come up with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong have expressed as subversive agents managed by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 participants - more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
A favorite agitator?
The League in Jihlava bears the name of the political party
A small doll game in the country city of Exocini about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is called the League of Jihlava.
The name was given according to one lead that goes to the October municipal elections.
Ten of his candidates are also chief of small copies in Jihlava Jan Mrák.
"There was an empty hole where there was no problem with that," said the Márka.
The lawmakers of the Yilhuvian Council had already died around the first league and recommended a change in the distribution system.
The little bastard got a lot of money on the website of the city about a million crowns.
And this year it's about a hundred thousand.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not small copies in dispute with the law or with the directive of the Master.
However, the situation is for the Agency to set up rules for the award and award award," said the speech master Radek Tulis.
Cut the contribution from the city and at the same time express as a small cup of support in one political party's elections, it's probably not going any longer.
The high-level "great" football has not yet met a similar policy requirement.
That the ČSSD national audit, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for.
On the other hand, I would like to be approached by sponsors from a series of companies," noted the president of the national football match Miroslav Vráček.
The head of the small football team on the other side and the jump into the name of the league doesn't let go
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would earn its own area with six games, chess and social equipment.
"For example, the game on the stairs isn't ours, we're in the rent," warned Andrej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlav's club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mile.
But there will be, for example, a mindless area for skaters who are about to fall in Jihlava," Mark warned.
The primator Jihlavi Jaroslav Vymasal (ODS) responded that the small copana uses a play with artificial grass in the streets of Rošické and Na Stopach, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a game that has maximum benefits.
We want to modernise or build a sports venue at school which will be available in the afternoon.
I think he's made huge progress in recent years for a little digging," said Wymasal.
Another political party in the names of the league does not appear according to Jan Mráky.
We have limitations.
If someone from one area enters the partnership with us, we don't give up on the other," he explained.
"The political tension in the name of the league, I consider it to be at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the Committee for Sport Karel Voldán.
"But you would like to agree whether Mr. Mráka is using the Small Coupon of Jihlava and the supply of cities for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition is entering university life - the first can fly by a pressure plane
We are pleased that we can answer the question by launching the first luxury travel services for students in Britain.
For the purpose of leaving the best impression when entering the university, the company also offers the possibility of transporting private printer or vehicle type Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also announced that the service also has its security site.
The service is an ideal opportunity for students who would otherwise have to pull their things across the whole state into a dangerous vehicle.
We are pleased that with our VIF (very important freshher - very important first) options this year, we will ensure that students get to the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
A spokesman from the company said that, given the fact that the services were first released, they had no reservations yet, but he added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students pay an annual school amount of 9,000 pounds, they expect to find their place in the market.
Compared to the students ten, twenty, thirty or four years ago, today's students are different with respect to expectations and expectations - it is more important than ever to do the right first idea and the VIF programme is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The national union of students, however, criticized the service as unreachable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is impossible.
Many students who come to university this month must be able to deal with the financial crisis before thousands of pounds of something as simple as getting on the road, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants will not be able to keep pace with the cost of basic needs.
The feminists stand against racism and police behavior after what happened in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson in Missouri.
The people who are waiting at the grave with their hands up their heads cry out: "Own's hands up! Do not shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson in Missouri because of the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz noted the mission of white feminists online.
She found that when it comes to the exercise of reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists prioritise sex before race.
With increasing pressure on the Middle East, which attracted the attention of the national press, Peréz noted that the white response is 100 % based on race.
Compared to the black reactions soon after the shooting on 9 August, personal articles such as “the idea of a white man over Ferguson” or “Fenminismus is not just about women being pushed off” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this is a significant change.
"I don't think there are too many people talking about race and heights at this level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially protected that they must be warned of it.
According to English professors at the State University of Ohio, Corthy Mitchell brought Ferguson into the light of the problems that the Afro-Americans must face every day and which are not considered to be "female issues".
"I can publish funny stories from my life on Facebook with my partner and get 150 people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colors in their own country in the past, it's quiet listening.
"How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black people such as Mitchell, who lived on the issue of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between race issues and dichotomy.
The blacks, she says, could not get luxury over these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Despite today's white issue of race and sex in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women's question and gender study at George Mason University, says they were doing otherwise.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were tied up and the reason for almost all cases of white violence was," Hattery said.
You needed a white man's cooperation to justify the chaining.
According to Hattery's distinction between whites and blacks, when the fighters for vote law like Susan B. Anthony examined at the end of the 19th century and realized that election law could have only one group of people - women or blacks.
"They decided to put cards on the right to vote for women and to focus on the right to black people later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why black women don't believe in whites.
We didn't get a good job.
We've never been black enough to protect their wives and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they started to organize the association of South Asian women for the first time.
The group was born 40 years after the blacks first said about help.
According to Mitchell's report on the response of white feminists to the questions raised by the action in Ferguson - the issue of police conduct, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "get" questions that the black generation had encountered.
"It wouldn't be great if activists in these [traditional feminism] spaces read the right to raise a child as seriously as they read the right to the anti-concept?" Mitchell added.
The second wave of feminists who have done their career in the fight against reproductive law and access to anti-conceptives now find out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot at by Facebook, where they published the Rebecca Carroll column from the Guardian, which demanded that white Americans protest more differently against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding are at risk in society – and views on race which are significantly different from those of public opinion – will try to change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steine has stopped intersessional feminism, which includes racial and gender issues, its comments on racial issues in America have been made by some people.
The U.S. Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who stole feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men, are “more vulnerable than their sisters”, but the notes of Steine's side of Ferguson are facing the criticism that she had raised earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program Our Brother's Keeper, which helped vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, caused this in many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's frustrated reaction.
The police relationship with the Black Community is not the only problem that is facing the interests of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police held this year on the southwestern side of the country about 63,000 young people without a permit, the question of reform of immigration laws again arose - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, a women's mobilisation organization for the reform of immigration laws, said that to be a possible question as an issue for women as necessary, the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercad.
In view of the fact that most of the permits are granted to men and women who come with them, they are considered to be vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories are in women's organisations," she said.
Accomodation for sale in Ipswichi
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, it rested on it in a pile of dust.
One-room private house, which is sold for 120,000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which it rests with its head on the dog's back.
The real office of Connells said the dog on the photo is a pet pet.
"The photo was mistaken there and was already removed," said the speaker.
In information on property, the real office of Connells described the former prayer as "a single single single single single-room house."
Although the photo office has already removed it from its websites, it continues to appear in propaganda materials.
The sale of the house attracted interest in social networks where some asked whether the dog was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey's city has a southwestern millionaire.
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A new millionaire on the southeastern of Perth, one lucky guy from Saturday's home lottery is going to take $1.1 million.
Traffic in Harvey had already doubled over the next five years, last November 2009 on a million-dollar profit.
It's a good deal, but it's just going to have to be logged in first.
The store owner Steve Forward said he was talking about winning the whole city on the southwestern of Perth.
It's the main theme and they're all broken up.
We thought a similar prize was on the dock.
Eight winners in Western Australia won one win last month, which ended in several happy weeks.
Last week a player in Canning Valley became one of five Serbian millionaires and just a few weeks ago in Belmont won an incredible 7.5 million dollars.
A winning couple sat down for 20 years and said that they won the world for them to process and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey is the only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, totalling $85 million.
The German Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Engineers want higher noises
In the press release, the GDL identified a protest for a security stand for which he freely chose time outside the transport unit.
At the allowed time, GDL rates take into account many people who return from the weekend by train until the first working day.
At the same time, we think of people coming to work during the day," said a committee meeting on Monday morning in a press release to state the status.
"Our first step should focus on freight transport, less travel," added the GDL.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the statement of rates.
It is not even clear how protest action affects international rail connections, except with the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase of five per cent between drivers and two hours of work per week.
At present, the average fee of drivers is moving depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million koruna) per year.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to adapt to the increase in wages when working time is reduced.
They point out that the peer evaluation of drivers must be developed in the same way as that of the other railway staff in which DB is not calculated by shortening the working week.
It was dangerous for Christ's car to start burning.
That's why Barum rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was about the damage of the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think something like that could happen.
There was no need to fix it temporarily and continue in less time to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we were to make it right there, yeah.
But we're still waiting for two more strikes, and it didn't happen.
He's got a high temperature and a risk of getting a car started burning, it was big.
I can't afford it.
In full time, you've had five rapid tests.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were quick, but I didn't get over the wind.
Everything was caused by the fact that we've been driving more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed us this.
You broke it so you could really think about winning.
I made myself and my car so we really had a game.
The work didn't come out tonight.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought about was missing.
But it's Barumka.
The technician unfortunately said no.
You weren't the only one of the guys who got away early from the war on primary.
They also came out of him with foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have gone away?
Yes.
Mostly for the fans, it was a damage because the race ended earlier.
He moved for a long time on the bridge and Jaromír Tarabus, which you're driving.
He just paid for coming out of the track and picking up almost two minutes' missing.
How did you feel about his performance?
It's bad because he could've repeated his winnings.
Well, he's been through the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had a good car.
It's very fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, although you appeared at the start of Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular participant in rally sports?
Of course not at this time.
I told Loni that Barumka is my last race and I didn't get it anyway.
I decided I'd eat it again.
It was my last nine-year-old start, and if it's gonna be a chance again in a year, I'll probably go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people got into trouble just because of you.
Did that make you happy?
We've been starting to a certain extent just because of him.
A crowd of people, whether known or unknown, kept asking whether I was going to eat.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you for Barumce?
The team's still on.
Next week we're going to the Highway, where Robert Adolf will run.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
In addition to this competition, he wants to borrow from us Fabi Honza Sykora.
Miro and I are waiting for a European bicycle in Switzerland and in Corsica.
That's what we're gonna have to do next year.
Can you tell me something?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsica rally belonged to the world's mystery, you got your maximum in the series.
Don't you mind trying the dark road again?
He's not hungry.
The oral agreement with the employee may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not given up on your doctor's confirmation of your disability, which serves as proof to the organisation that you cannot perform your work obligations for health reasons.
You didn't even recognize your employees.
The next line came to the agreement that the dates will be recorded as permitted, but the agreement was only oral.
Although the labour law does not lay down the obligation to allow a written confirmation of the employee's agreement with a cut-off permit, this procedure has been certified in practice.
If it comes only to the oral agreement, you have no confirmation agreement.
Later, there may be a certain agreement with the cut-off, as in your case, about whether or not the work is considered a long-term absence, and therefore the reason for the sudden interruption of the employment rate in accordance with § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a court dispute with your employees there is thus no evidence to prove it.
The working relationship with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, you only have certain days listed in the calculation list as an unexplained absence.
The unspoken absence in the budget does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to take a mass unemployment insurance), although it is therefore difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit your doctor again and let you confirm in writing that you have actually arrived at a level where you were incapacitated (sometimes called "nothin'", it's only a doctor's record).
When looking for a new job, you can present the above evidence and explain the situation.
In practice, it is not appropriate to assess whether the presentation of written medical evidence of disability, both the rapid notification of employees or the request for written consent with surgery is permitted.
You're avoiding any such complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back
Back on track ended for Tony Stewart only half the Atlantic Motor Speedway track.
Stewart second came into play after he ran the right front pneumatic in 172 round and finished the race for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car into the garage, didn't show up to the reporters and left.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said that car number 14 is broken, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and we'll hope we'll get more.
Stewart got to play first in the Sunday evening competition with Kyle Busche, which required the right side of his car.
"We have hoped for a good end to today's race," said Johnston and added, "that just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was down and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and had to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get his place in the table.
He returned to the race during a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart to the race.
The authorities said that the investigation of the cause of the accident would take at least two more weeks.
It's not yet decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
A three-year-old champion was waiting for a hot excitement before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, started at the start of the race at 10th and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd car, Busch's car is no.
18 got out of control, got out of the second shot and landed at Stewart, where both cars were sent to the parking lot.
Stewart went on, but he got to the 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, making 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new tax administration.
In 103 parking stations, it is worth 12.3 million koruna per year.
In recent years, for the same places for drivers of taxis, it has chosen 150 thousand kroner a year.
He informed the staff of Lukaš Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city was used for the selection of administrators.
Then the winner won the rent for the past 1,000 crowns per year.
She's right, but she's changed.
At the present time, it decides on the above tenders.
"The year since the opening of the original rental contracts and the start of the selection proceedings has shown that the new rental system is far more favourable and more just for Prague," he says.
The most precious flag is in Paris
The highest price was offered by interested people on the streets of Paris.
It's gonna pay $2.1 million a year.
About 1.5 million of the new managers paid for places before the General House or at the Václavs.
The new rules for renting of the tax office were adopted by the Council in the fall of 2012 and announced the original rental contracts in the spring of the year.
The election was held in four valleys and the new manager found 29 seats.
We've had to clean up the study for the second time this year.
We've all released her every time she got practically another fish around the chat.
Then we found Savo there.
Incredible smell!
Our study in the club always drew enough beautiful spring water.
And it wasn't a person who was done professionally, her grandfather used to get her out.
It's been a long time.
It was just like three rounds and totally awesome, like everything else on the chat, but as I say.
The water was great.
By the summer.
When we started the season, of course, we got water.
When she was there for a few months, she deserved it.
Well, it seemed to us that the water wasn't coming any further.
We were hit if something didn't happen there.
In the place where the skull was passed, it was possible for a few bruises, the desk wasn't even there, so the opening was sealed by the smell of silence.
Our inspection confirmed that the cell was moving.
Otherwise there was nothing in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we let her go again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we've improved improvised pressure around the tube.
We've noticed strange things in the closet.
There was a beautiful package on the ground with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And the next piece of cake.
Now it looked like a brilliant mouse.
In the top, in the places where the ghosts are, the finders were the rest of the fish!
And it's heavy!
Our decision is also fair.
Someone would say that grandpa just gave up on the chat.
And he wouldn't be so far away from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just an inspired letter, just the ceiling is submerged.
They're mostly on board.
And the car.
And a lighthouse on the beach.
The door with a wide margin was open most of the way someone walked there in one corner.
A few of the already mentioned passages.
Without a net, they usually fly flying there, and a nest is on the tracks.
It's too much to mention the mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fight, and that's it.
The air didn't help now.
The whole bunch of bastards.
So we cleaned up the whole decision.
In particular, the fish on the beach was alive!
We also pulled out things that were around: a prank, a sheraklic board, and so on.
Our chat in the distance welcomed the incoming disinfectant.
We were wondering who could find out about those unpleasant remains there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in all.
It's hard for her to go to church.
Grandpa attacked a neighbor who's not completely fine.
If he didn't give us the pleasure of the French, did he?
It's practically all year after year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to keep an eye on and control it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, while only on the floor and washing before the tests are finished, but it was good.
Tahat water from the forest students is nothing I'd like to do for a while.
One time we heard a terrible grueling squeezing of our legs.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw in the bed next to the verandy a long, strong black hat.
She jumped a rope over her and burned it like crazy.
Her mother betrayed her because she thought that Réza had won a tragic defeat from her rival.
Suddenly, though, the hat parted into the club, and part of it moved forward.
Balcony's coming up.
The line's got hysterical hits.
We ran down.
The needle, long over a meter and fat as a bull, wanted to kiss a huge hole and Réza protected her in it.
It wasn't clear whether she wanted to save the thief or if she wanted to eat it herself, but it was inappropriate.
When the wolf saw the violence like our entire family, she probably said we'd get it when we're hungry, and she'd come to the conclusion with an elegance.
We flew for her.
It's like a blizzard jump for a study.
It's just that we noticed on her back another bottle of spray.
According to the waves, it's about fish.
She wasn't there before!
Our new security around the core was a bit of a shadow.
And that's what we've been closing up over the day.
I wish I could...
We went out, and we got everyone there looking for one spring.
We haven't waited a long time.
It's embarrassing for the student.
First there was a flat head with yellow months on the chest.
And then she jumped out on her test.
She stopped around her neck and started getting inside.
The ex-employee complained, bought a notebook and sold it
After his release an employee bought it to the computer company and then sold it.
The money we got was still going to be lost before the police were arrested.
In a short time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand korunas.
"Notebooks after the transfer took him to Olomanoca, where he sold them on the market," said superior Schuper Police Commissioner Rostislav Brüngner.
The reason for the subpoenas was the city's employees for the release and also the profit of the money.
"In hearing he claimed that he used money on credit payments," said Brücker.
The police also found out that the undercover is a pathological player who was repeatedly treated for psychiatric care.
The money could also be spent in excellent devices or in videotape terminals.
"The fact is, we haven't found any money," said the Commissioner.
A deputy who has already been convicted of theft is now threatening to stay in prison for a year to five years.
The police have not yet explained whether it is dangerous to punish also the markets that the notebooks bought at the price and continue to sell.
"It is true that new goods have been completely converted, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged yet.
Come on, another kiss, you'll manage it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, our computers made some changes.
This was the biggest change in the path that led to the flood, instead of bringing it back to the Yellow Plains.
At the race I enjoyed with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I decided to survive it a little from the other side.
With the whole team we decided to treat our readers personally at the station where we took photos and videos together.
To give my view on the other hand to perfection, I took the role of my personal leader.
Together with a friend of Katia, we arranged carefully before the start at the end of the corridor 60 to 70 minutes.
We got along with friends who walked around us into the sector for a faster run.
There wasn't much time left.
Several games to play, start sports tests, take off and start!
The spring calls, but the quick start was followed by the purchase of the starter.
In five minutes, we'll get to the front, stop measuring, and we'll blow up for 10 hours.
We're going out with the yellow hat of runners who like Katia run their first race.
Meanwhile, all the fresh, slightly sloping sun on the surface gives a look at the White House almost as wet dreams.
The pulsating mass coming across the border looks like the whole of Prague is running.
On the border between the Temple and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has the power.
The light doll at the Palacke village encourages many runners to slow down or jump into the foot.
Just before crossing into the Divadel, I saw a police investigation and immediately followed him by Viek Pavlista at an incredible rate.
I'm hearing the amazing excitement of other runners.
I'm moving to the end of the road, I'm going to wake him up, he's going to cry with me, but just before that, he's gonna break my leg and our hands are going through.
The Divadel Street itself offers a chance for a short rest and relaxation.
There's a need for places where I can see the breath.
A tour of the Manes bridge shows Prague throughout the beautiful sunset.
I don't breathe and my legs aren't almost alone.
For the first time in town, there's a moment of truth.
During the passage of the Kátía road, it is covered with a blanket and shows a jump of blue.
I'll see if she doesn't need help, and I'll let a series of exciting words get her out of her mind.
This is one of the most southerly places to go. In this stage of the race there is no such thing as this, but there is a need to follow the environment well.
I don't know yet that the idea of the southernmost place gets its real meaning later on.
For Prussian protection, tourists and friends of other runners are encouraging us.
I'm trying to communicate with everyone who's offering hands, and I'm doing it in Káté, because ten of the fans are like half of the energy dynamics.
The fact is it works, we're speeding up again, and if we're going to lose enough, now the moving train is starting.
We're running out of ten runners when I have someone especially tired, I'm trying to encourage him a few words: "Come on, you'll do it again, you'll do it!"
No one's running us for the last restaurant, we're speeding up.
We've been running for an hour and a fourth, adding, it's all right to wait.
Three kilometers to the target are going to be painful, but it's really necessary to stop.
The sun has already set a little west and the final day is at the end of the race.
The last escape to the bridge, the perimeter and the only line to the target.
The time we're running, I wonder where this girl is going?
"Come on, let's go in thirty hours, let's go!" I call.
We're trying it, we're printing, and there's a target here.
It's thirty-six seconds.
Well, what can be done?
The trainer's been down for 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
That's a great result.
I'm just trying to help Kate get her feet on the ground. I'm gonna help her get some rest.
It's on her to see frustration, but she's also lucky for the well done performance.
I'll take her out for a while.
Euphoria doesn't give us any idea of the pressure on the way to the store.
It's here to see that Kosia Street wasn't the southernmost place.
It's here for the purpose of a flood that's under pressure of about ten thousand runners stuck to the ground.
If someone doesn't like giving, it's not a place for him.
And after a while I lose my head and wonder if these beautiful views and around the last few years have become the most interesting course for what's going on.
From my own experience, I know there's no fun to run the race.
If tens of thousands of people are added to it, the rich and reliable programme and closure of the entire Prague Centre for All Transport is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of track showed the runners many interesting places, which also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere scattered in the Yellow Laes moved between the race and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random fans pushed it on every meter of track.
At the city's historic center, unfortunately, I have to count with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is on one side of the wall is restricted and on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race has ended with the passing goal, I'll appreciate it as a very stated one.
My goal was to have some fear of the health of the participants, but it finally worked out well.
Write us into the discussion if you like the road and what you say about the situation in the target.
Special observers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff throughout Bulgaria participated in the international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
They have been reimbursed to the peaceful demonstration of their demand for reinstatement of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
The list of requirements to be met with the interim minister of justice, Christo Ivanov, is also higher.
Months were symbolically protested against a new working time and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shift.
Although the prison officers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"The meeting is still underway," said BNR’s director general of the prison services Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Committeeal Organisations of Employees in the Ministry of the Interior will also join in the protests of prison officials.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them
The physical habits of bestsellers are not written, but Brian Green of the Columbia University was hit into black in 1999.
His book The Elegant universe has become the most accessible road for lying, how to discover the vastness of problems that exist today in a series of theoretical physics - trying to combine two very powerful but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantitative theory and general relativity theory.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant universe is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a sad story.
The physical basic problem between the two key theories (but at this time our de facto universe is divided into two worlds with different laws) has been resolved and has so solved the idea that it stands for relativism and the lay people.
In addition, Greene was so fresh that he could not read how interesting it was in his book.
In addition, he made his "failure" from most of the two other books: the structure of the universe and the hidden reality.
It seems that neither the author would object to the fact that if his book were to continue faster, the fact is that even after 15 years the elegant universe is still providing almost everything that the informed era with a desire to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next few years there will be only something more alive in this area (maybe because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full-flow"), so it is a good time to get into Greenen’s nonviolent openings of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound travel, fantastic, strange or mystical.
However, he is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let's turn our sky from the universe as a whole to something more earthly, specifically to a long and thin garden adjoining.
Imagine that you are taking a stomatometer away from one side of the canyon on the other and you are following the whole scenario from a half-kilometre distance (as on the picture and on the next page).
From this distance, you can easily record the length of the adjudicated adhesion in water, but if you do not exactly tolerate bistrosrosis, you know the weight of adhesion.
In view of its great distance from the hake, you would think that the haze brought to life on the hake has only one dimension in which you can walk: the left-right dimension of the hake.
If someone asks you where the dragon was at the moment, answer him with only one statement: the distance of the dragon from the left (or right) end of the dragon.
This is all we want to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, the long neck of a hat looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, he's got a fat ass.
If we increase it all, we look at this second dimension - in the shape of a circle of surrounding adhesion.
In such an increased view it is evident that the sailor can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right size along the length of the hat, but also in a "size in/against the direction of the movement of the hours gloves", so around the round of the hat.
You start to understand that in order to determine the position of a small mollusc, you have to set two numbers: how far from the end of the hat and where it's on the circle of the surrounding hat.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the adhesion is bidimensional (e.g. experts point out that this chapter focuses purely on the misleading theory of the page.
Paragraphs 12 and 13 shall apply.)
The surface of the adhesion is two-dimensional: one long subdimensional dimension is reflected directly in the direction of the direction of the direction, marked by a circle, is short and narrow.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size of the side handle is long and easy to see.
The size of the adjacent chain is short, "cut" and highly known.
In order to know the existence of the circumference, we had to test the adhesion with a much better solution.
The above example illustrates an important property of space dimensions.
That they're split into two groups.
They can be big, bright, and therefore straight, or small, wild and very noticeable.
Of course, in that case, we did not go straight ahead so that we could find out the "fucking" dimensions of the thickness of the adhesion.
You've had enough to get help from a remote look.
But if the hats were thin -- like hair or capillary -- we'd only figure out the dime dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent her article to Einstein in 1919, in which he expressed the alarming thought that space geometry could have more than three known dimensions.
He argued that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's current relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can lead to a single, combined concept structure.
Suddenly the question of how this Kaluz bridge goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly proposed between the order and which he clearly expressed and clarified Swedish mathematics Oscar Klein in 1926 is, and it falls with the claim that the space geometry of our universe can have both large and modest dimensions.
This means that just as the dimension in the direction of the length of the agora has our universe has a large, transparent and easy-to-see three dimensions, whose existence we know every moment.
But the analogous with the cross-section of the garden can also have an extra dimension, which has been thrown into space so unscathed that the past has remained hidden even before our most perfect experimental equipment.
To get a clearer view of Kaluz's proposal, let's stay for a while.
Imagine we're drawing a black color in the direction of a series of circles.
The walls still look like a thin one-dimensional frame.
With the distance now, thanks to the cross, we're going to figure out the sine dimension again, we'll see the same motif from picture 2.
Obviously we see that the surface of the adhesion is bidimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with another short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circle dimension has three large space dimensions, together with four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw object with too many dimensions.
To help us with our presentation a little bit, note the illustration on page 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circle dimension.
On the picture, we increase the view of the geometry of the space as we have increased the surface of the adhesion.
Each following level represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have an additional dimension (see them on the fourth level of enlargement), if they are dragged into a sufficiently small space; thus we explain that we have not yet noticed them directly.
The four network usually reflects the known "large" dimension, while the circles are new, small and sinusted dimensions.
Just like drawings in a thick blanket, these circles exist in each place of normal dimensions - only because of the attention we have focused them on only the percentages on the four-line network.
The background of Figure 4 usually reflects the known structure of the space - the common world around us - in such normal measurements as meters, observed by the small square side of the square.
In each of the following images, we focus on the small area of the previous image; we increase it to become visible.
At first, there's nothing special about it, as we see on some of the first level increases.
However, if we go on our path with the microscopic properties of space geometry - on the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 - we look at this new, shape of the circle with a slightly smaller dimension, which I like to draw even in the thick shape of the cube.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional cross-sectional dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of an adjoining cross-section in each point of their length.
In the interest of observation, we have only highlighted the circumference of the cross-section in some regular points.
Figure 4 Kaluz and Klein's exhibition on the microscopic structure of the space geometry.
The comparison with the hat is obvious, perhaps we also notice important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-reaching space dimensions (of which we drew only two), where the universe has only one large dimension.
Even more important difference is that we're talking about space geometry of the universe itself, never just about some object inside the universe, we need our adhesion.
The basic idea is the same.
If the additional rounded-up dimension is extremely minimal, recognize it as - as the cross-section of adhesion - much more difficult than to observe the apparent, large and wide dimensions.
If the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be discovered over the power of our latest tools to increase.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a large circle within the usual dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration correctly indicates.
The circumference dimension is a new dimension, which exists in each of the three common dimensions.
It is the size of the other three dimensions independent of each other, as are the dimensions of the Shora-down, the left-right and the front-back independent (and the third) one.
A sufficient small threshold could move in all four dimensions and in determining its position we would need four data except three more common positions in the circle dimension; if we also count time, then five data, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Did it kill you?

The e-book price is 149, - Kč.
To our surprise, then, we find that if we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's view is not excluded from the existence of additional narrow dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have a calmer dimension than we can see only with our eyes.
How small should they be?
The latest technical equipment can identify the structure of a large billion cubic metres.
We can look at the smaller weed dimensions of the nest.
In 1926 Klein combined Kaluz's original concept with a number of ideas from right-wing quantitative mechanics.
Its calculations indicated that the additional circumference dimension could have a size of about one Plank's length, so the size is far from the range of the capabilities of today's devices.
Since then physics has called for additional small space dimensions of Kaluzov-Klein's theory.
Hohnout Honza Homola suggests how to exercise on electric guitar: Part 5.
The whole "twenty" is based on a 12-twentieth harmonic form which you can freely repeat.
Who's the type in the music theory, finds her principle detailed here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
Learning a lottery and a lottery leader whose facebook profile can be followed here, has been living as a chart 20 years ago from maturity.
He's a cytar of Captain Wohnout who's probably not going to leave.
Kitaristou is after his father, just like Brother Matthew, leader of the Wohnouts.
Start training on one side.
"The rhythmic model is only for you, you can imagine anything, then it's enough to apply it to a harmonic model of twelve," says Honza.
When you add another page, you can change the figure again.
It's enough to listen to and follow Honz what can be thought of by 12 harmony on two pages and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you pick up a third party, you can already cocktail some songs with melodies.
When you finally add the fourth, attention to the change in the ship, warning Honza in the video.
The next time Honza comes back to the pentatonica and try to get her together with the twelve.
So keep her a good time.
As best you can, you can read it in a conversation with Jane Homol in his first lesson in his school games on an electric guitar here.
Another hole without waiting?
It's not for a great celebration, it's a garden of Christmas.
We take him down and we like him.
The first time we had more chances, the second at home," he repaired an attacker who this time cut out of the kitchen stove.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but you just gave her a huge sandbag?
In particular, I didn't realize it, even if it was on the second branch where there were domestic fans, it'd probably be worse.
You've finished the pendulum in half an hour, but you've also got a hole from the pen in a few minutes.
What happened?
We slept first, we were passive, got out of this hole and then a pentalate.
You've been after her and you've been a better team for the first time.
Why did that change after the switch?
It's hard to say.
I agree with the fact that we've been playing after the incantation until we're done with the stopper.
In the cabin we said we wanted to keep the game going, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's also true that the housekeepers said something about their game, they didn't seem to have much peace with her.
You first scored on the competition game, while you don't have to go home yet.
Why is that so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it depends on us how we cope with it.
We started out well in Brno, but then it was bad for us, Plzen, it's another category.
You've been waiting for four tapes on your head, weren't you afraid it might be similar after the last run?
It's probably not, but we're obviously glad that we don't have to talk about waiting in the back of the game.
Now we've added another one without waiting, but there's only three in the six game, which is not yet on the big screen.
Iceland - a lion reaches from miles away from the crater.
A lion flying on the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the ice crater Vatnajökulll, is attracted by the underground tunnel from miles away.
This is located under the refrigerator, as is the same part of the underground rail tunnel mentioned.
This reality is now the most worrying scientist...
The situation in the past remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still leaves around the same number of lions.
Unlike the original estimates, however, it is less than 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
On the contrary, the previous outbreaks of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x greater.
However, scientists are afraid that the lava tunnel could be opened even in places where it's under the ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the similar intensity of the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, as in the Jökulsá á Fjöllum River, as in other rivers.
Around the rupture it's a strong smell of cheese, from the trunks of leaves and lungs.
It is not clear whether the ERU is suitable for the tourist movement, as it was in the case of the ERU in Fimmvördühals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is much more gas here," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, since yesterday, there has been a significant improvement, in early hours there has been a shortage of air.
The feet after the sandstorms were empty.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air operations the orange level (second highest) for Bardarbung and yellow (third) for Askju is paid.
The sky above Chebe belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She's gone after the wings.
A flight day in Chebu.
On the Boeing Starman PT-17 was presented by Peggy Walentinová, who flew out of the cabin to the house on top of a double wing and also between the wings.
It's only about the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Chebu was already over this year, and the suppliers were able to prepare a few interesting flight tickets again.
The prime minister at the oldest Czech airport was not only "the horse after the wings" in giving German acrobatics Peggy Walentino, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft flight 18.
The one who drew attention to himself is his own vicious spirit.
Acrobatic called Wingwalking has its origin in the United States.
After World War I, many former military pilots tried to do so.
Only because of a large number of fatalities, he was banned.
But today they're going back to the flight days program.
Peggy's gonna get out of the couch on the top wing after the start.
There's a variety of exercises there.
At the end of the exhibition they are moved to space between the wings of the airport where the show continues," said Ludék Matéjěček from the Chebsk Ultralight Club and the organizer of the airport day.
The pilot Boeing Starman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main theme of the program, then the next presentation of the Mustang sticker was a storyteller on the cake.
The legendary striker joined the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in custody (also in numbers).
Such a composition could have been seen by flying fans in Česk for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavsky then brought the breaths of acrobatics with a plane from 1945.
He was still made for war, but he probably never participated.
He was in military reserves.
Since 1963 he's been in the civil sphere.
And like a race flight.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich City.
At the same location there is also another spare part of the Czech flight day, two-engine Beechcraft C45H Explorer.
He didn't go to the airport to look at a possible machine.
It's a long way off. It's a long way off.
The mirror also obtained the machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French aircraft.
The small transport aircraft jumped into the abandoned Turbolet and from the German Hofu took part of the German delegation on a flight day.
German neighbors were introduced to Cheba with rebuilt planes like 18T or triangular formation of two-year-old Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return to the camera!
The parental care of Lucie Borhy was exchanged at least for tonight for those workers.
Stress or nervousness - a blond modator doesn't know anything about it.
Modernization of television news was as good for her as it would never stop with him for two months!
It's just two weeks after the blonding ended six weeks after women were born to experience the greatest stress.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main report on TV New.
Regular return awaits her according to information Blask.cz up to a month.
But only her daughter Linda needs more than television fans now.
Lucie Borhy's back on the TV screen, and it was a black trip.
Shows for a year in Prague?
She'd sell herself, she's planning a divorce for Jagr.
It would be appropriate if such a thing were done during the mystery of the world.
But it depends on how the match stands for it," he said after an exhibition called the Golden Curtain, in which a brilliant Nagan team once again met.
And the players who shared in the gold hattrick.
The players should taste it, should they?
I'm sure.
It would be short to make a divorce with the golden generation during the mystery.
I think during the tournament they're allowed to find one of two days when it's completely free and where such an escape would be made.
Let's say this to Gum (Jirjem Schlegro) or Bejj Šcherban (the owner of the Yihlav game) who would take care of it...
Arena would sell herself.
So what if you play New Jersey play-off?
So when I get there...
The game in the representation, but you don't want it.
Or did the Jihlav meeting somehow change your decision?
The representations and exhibitions are two different things and they are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially to the mystery of the world.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy this nagan?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
Man's relived history and lived a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans but also for us hockeyists.
The most important thing was Ivan Hlink's kiss.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and that there's a generation that's really been going on.
Famous Lener, Vladimir Rožíčka and Petr Čechmanek for the miners.
You're still gonna get your first representation?
He doesn't remember anything like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Rechel, we grew up in one third.
For all, it was the first representative start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, it wouldn't be said.
In Jihlava he caught Dominic Hashek for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
I'm never surprised by the Hashan on my ice.
I wanted to bring it back to him with this criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticised Jágra for reasons why he decided to end up in representation).He just got great.
And Hnilička's got a great show.
He was right there with me once in the night and he was brave there.
And now he's getting famous.
First United States and then the Netherlands, footballers start to qualify
In the morning, prominent guests arrived at the NH Hotel.
People could see the need for a nurse Petra Čecha from Chelsea, the representative trainer Paul Vrba...
And over there, it's in a black shirt, it's Tomás Rosic!
Mr Arsenal and the President of the delegation arrived at the meeting about half of the latter.
We're waiting for a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said when he was represented in a representative interview before the reporter.
Czech Representative Programme
Monday 1st September: start of the race, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Train opened for fans (18:30, summer) Autogram (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Česko - USA (20:15, summer)
Tuesday 9 September - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the race
Russian and sex. Fananists can still support the US Middle East (20:15).
The representation for them also opened the afternoon training which begins at 18:30 a.m. on the Year.
And he'll be followed by an autograph that Rosic and Chech won't miss.
Otherwise, it'll be more comfortable for the national team.
Which commends the Vrba trainer who has just complained about the amount of social action he has taken.
Finally, we're going to commit what we want to commit.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's good if you have players together for eight days.
We'll have time to practice things that haven't been so long," said Vrba, who is officially leading the national team since January.
The Czech football representation will take place at the time of entry into a new qualifying cycle.
The representative has three seats under the Wrbo, all ready.
With Norway and Finland she lost 2:2 and Rakouske lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's it.
The catch with the Netherlands is still relaunching the qualification of the European Mastership Process 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech man if it could also rule the General against the United States.
It was the first half to get to know each other.
Now there are important results.
We have to think about it so we can be successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player of the three-accompanied nominee who has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
It's hot.
If he couldn't get to the middle trial against the United States, trainer Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she had died after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After she was diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her life in the belief that she was only surviving for a few years.
In fact, it was about Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of parental disorders that damage nerves beyond the brain and the liver.
The charity CMT UK said that bad diagnosis is a common problem among CMT people, because it is only a small amount of disability.
It is estimated that in the United Kingdom some 23,000 people are suffering from CMT, which can show symptoms in the field of motor vehicles such as muscle weakness, non-motor feet and broken fingers on the throat.
In those who have reached, there may also be a lack of sensitivity or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms are worse in time.
When Rogers was thirteen, she thought he was suffering from Freidreich's attack (FA) - a disease that has a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrates the 18th birthday she'll be nailed to a Christmas tree, and she'll die before she's thirty.
A mother of two children who are now 51 says: “As a child I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell down every day and everything took a while.
I've never been able to ride with other children on bicycles or on a skateboard, and at school I was shocked by how I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 and was after several operations to release her Achilles tears and to clean up her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room and look at her documentation where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I followed, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about disability in the library and wrote to the Association FA,” she says.
When they answered, I was in shock, I was really panicking.
I thought I'd end up on the train before it's eighteen, and before it's fifty, I'll die, and I'll gradually lose all my abilities.
I was totally alone and I planned my funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to ride had not increased as much as she imagined, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood there, kissed her, and said: “Dear, I don’t think you have a disease here, otherwise you would be on the car.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After several genetic tests were completed, it was found to have CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child," she declared.
The CMT UK Charity Organisation has started a month of information on CMT to alert the patient.
Washington sub-contractors: tax is paid by the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new study published last week, the company’s state and local tax rates in the country, with the acceleration of economic health last year, were steadily rising and the companies in Washington were no exception.
The participants in Maryland and Virginia totalled $27.6 billion for the fiscal year 2013 in the state and local accounts, which is 3.8 % higher than $26.6 billion chosen in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - was 4.3% for 671 billion dollars last year compared to 3,9% last year and was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when tax fell.
According to the study carried out by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political collection Centre on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster by 4.3 % than local remedies by 3.9 %.
More than half of the tax revenue of the range is 56 % of the tax on livestock tax and 36 % of the revenue of Maryland is from the company.
Virginia, with 28 %, shows a reasonable minimum tax revenue from the company.
According to the researchers, the majority of the tax revenue increase is due to an increase in the property value of the related companies, which increased by 3.7% in the three years to come.
Although most profits come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the same situation appears to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, representing an annual increase of 4.2 % compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not raise so much State and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax represents less than five companies' taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the tax on property represents almost half of the state and local tax.
"In Maryland, the company owns a lot of property, in particular the tax base around D.C., government or non-profit organisation that does not pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenue from the company cannot be attributed only to the realising market with real estate.
According to the data, revenue from the company is also rising.
Companies in this region have published revenue from businesses of $2.3 billion, which has increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has chosen one billion dollars in the company's income taxes, most in the region.
Despite the same trend, the local tax burden on businesses does not rise as quickly as possible in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national level, at 4.3 %, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9 %.
In Virginia alone, the tax rate increased by 4.1 %.
Virginia has the lowest income tax of all three companies (of which all have the same taxes) 6 %.
The tax rate of commercial companies in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, to 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has a lower state and local tax rate and a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. study was inappropriate.
Through this benefit, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a tax reduction law of 6.9% to 6%, like Virginia, and the tax will fall to 5% next year.
If the revenue targets are to continue to be met in the coming year, the rate of revenue tax could be reduced by 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study with small businesses in Washington, this is why they pay higher State and local taxes.
The tax on biofuels carried out by small businesses as personal income tax - the cost-response structure of the increase in prices, according to which the majority of companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia have grown by 20% over the last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
According to researchers, the trend and the overall increase in biofuel tax will probably continue next year, the total tax revenue from sales for both state and local governments will increase by 6.2 % in comparison with the same period in the last year of the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington may, however, remain behind the others because the reduction of state expenditure will choose its tax on the labour market.
What happened to you: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafato's legs
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for a meeting on New Russia
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in south-eastern Ukraine where government units with a pro-Russian rebellion have been subjected from deep down.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, it would be difficult to return to the Russian market.
Support provided by the West for the fight against the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, according to which it supports democratic values.
The end of the conflict, according to him, depends on Kyiv, and it cannot be said when the Ukrainian crisis ends.
Further sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has granted the right to disagree with the party
The European Commission, together with the diplomats, will propose another confirmation of anti-virus sanctions by week, decided at night on the EU summit today.
This was told by the Permanent President of the Meeting of the Member States of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for the adoption of the sanctions were already prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye rewards in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Union summit on behalf of the European Council, thus known as the Union President, who conducts the summits of the Member States.
From December to December two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be rewarded.
In the face of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton's Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is founded by Federica Mogherinov.
Italy, which will thus become the Vice-President of the European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.

The sender for the ČSSD Stanislav Huml is clearly aware of who shot the Malaysian aircraft over Ukraine.
According to him it is apparent that "the hard sanctions that have been declared in view of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with about 300 dead have been deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, it's also known as the CIA manuscript.
Unfulfillable promises.
The choices are closer and the sides are offered again and impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and walk over Prague.
This is repeated before any elections: parties make no promises.
Also now, with the nearby municipal elections, politicians are offering who likes the voters more.

It was August 30, 1944, when the Czech-Slovenian independent Brigade moved to France.
Her manager, Alois Liška, systematically asked for the addition of technical equipment and forwarding to the front.
The British side finally recovered and organized this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the hands of German forces.

Joan Rivers family: "We keep our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has shown today that she does not lose hope that a eleven-year-old comic book will heal.
"Thank you for your welcome and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her hands.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a telephone call to the rescue service that she received at the heart of the Yorkkill Endoscopy at the Upper East Side, as she introduced the source.
Doctors carefully maintain it under the influence of satativa and under strict supervision until they are sure of its status, which remains “responsible”.
Responses to themselves did not last long, including ineffective internet support from such individuals as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Realita is overtitled
That the media overrule the reality, there's no news.
I know the headlines are "prosperous" news, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been suffering a lot lately, the most extreme is the word of punishment.
This is particularly true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It's quite common to read "Israel is trapped in Gaza".
First you read in the text that the Israeli "flight" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, which is sometimes appropriate at the time indicated.
This will then appear on the title "The Both Sides Disappeared Right".
Does a journalist realize that this process directly forms part of the anti-semitic existences that are growing across Europe (and not just there)?
It hasn't even lasted sixty years since the end of World War II.
So far, people who have survived Shoo are alive.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the tax called the word "Jewish swine" and similar superstitions, I was shocked.
That's what the world wants to accomplish what didn't tell Hitler?
Do our journalists know that after the Jews were assigned to liquidate Slovenia?
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You're often marked for "watching dog democracy".
So kiss her.
As long as he's here.
And also deny the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its citizens.
How would you like our government to be maintained if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech people would be rid of the map of the world and the Czech Republic?
Maybe you should also know another fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs live in Israel's territory.
And they're all right there.
If you ask them why they don't go between "theirs" and maybe in Gaza, they'll tell you why they're doing it?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and spy health (I have seen on my own eyes how to visit Hadassa's private hospital, which is funded from Jewish sponsoral gifts from around the world, often also goes to Arabs and are well-informed there).
Hamas is also attacking his Arab brothers with his rifles.
The only real help to Gaza, and yet this unpleasant area, is to rescue Hamas and protect him.
And don't forbid Israel to be straight in titles.
Tell me about Hamas' practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Please report that Hamas intends to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
And for the death of innocent Arab children.
Please report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please inform me that within nine years of self-determination in Gaza, this area could have been exciting thanks to humanitarian assistance from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, where neither Gaza nor Gaza managers are paid, even it is clear that supply supply is now being cancelled.
If Hamas did not invest money in underground tunnels to destroy suicide victims in Israel, but needs to build homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers in Gaza would be better off.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitter
AMAZON just confirmed the claim Information from the morning: Internet retailer - producer of videos and hundreds of other things - buys $1.04 billion ($990 million) video streaming service Twitter.
The announcement did not surprise anyone because no one would expect Twitter to buy someone, but because it was expected that the buyer would be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitter Googlu seemed to be one billion safe, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitter, which founded Justin.tv just three years ago, was designed to become a popular video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who sent online transfers from her - words Business Insider “YouTube for Life-Translated Game”.
Twitche interface.
On YouTube there are already popular videos "Let's play", the type where smart (most of the older) give the game of processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that when YouTube saysTwitche comes to an extreme, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch, no one has much to say, was an example of how the alleged company pays possible competition.
They wondered why the agreement with YouTube did not go out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the statement by CEO Twitter Emmeta Sheara: "We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster."
Another surprise is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitter.
For substances like me who claim that sports are doing better than they are watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about playing instead of playing real games just to watch.
One thing is to look at three morning friends over the shoulder as Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is to look at someone else how he gets twenty principles into his head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could just look at.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular heroes are from the perspectives of the players, so looking at their record without having a perspective to control, it's quite a good recipe as to how to fix the beads.
Let me let the games type speed run, in which Roger Banisteri will finish our electronic time game in record time is fun.
But if someone's not the master of play or humor, his channel on Twitter will probably not be very interesting.
But what about this skeptic like me?
Twitter has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth on top of internet service.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitter is moving to Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it could be connected to YouTube.
But Twitter has something that she wants to attract every company: the pride of young men who want interns.
As Twitter director Shear, Amazon and Twitter said, "They believe in the future of her" and the media don't seem to be surprised, nor do they look like - kisses - fans.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American Atheist Logger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss a variety of matters that conflict with their worship, they often ask us the question: Whom will you believe?
A word of God or a word of man?
It's like if human research was completely useless compared to the authority they claim to have their doctrines.
Only when they say "man", they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really exists intelligently with the Creator with some purpose, then it is who created the fossil record that leaves evolution history, and it must be who created the genetic model that they respond to, and it must be who has added a series of evidence that shows beyond the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, make fun of it.
And they were people who wrote all these texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every holy teaching that is clearly taught by any religion in the world describes itself as man - made, not gods.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their beloved gods or should have listened to the dictatorship of angels, but these texts were not written to any other than the mortals with a certain degree of imagination, no angels and no gods at all.
If there really was a real god, it would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, super-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire universe.
If the essence of such size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, one sacred letter.
It would be known anywhere in the world, without precedents, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure with such a work.
And people would not want to believe it carefully because it would be consistent, based on verifiable and verifiable evidence, and would reveal deep maturity and wisdom far beyond all human boundaries.
She'd be inspired by every reader to the unit of common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
Only what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the only religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all continue to break down more and more separate denominations, searching for the truth and in every way harming God’s guidance, regardless of the continuous deviation and division in each direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Baha'u'llah of Kitáb-i-Akkadás, the Zarathustro Adí-Granth, the Sikh Mahabharatska Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the only true God" and all of them are said to be on their way.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on their way to a certain extent.
None of the above-mentioned books shall benefit from any other advantage.
None of them have evidence and no historical evidence can be confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I'm not saying I've proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies because they contain inequalities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So you can't claim they're evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them are spreading wild animals instead of living things, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy - by the fact that anyone can also contain a prophecy that was not fulfilled.
Former theologians admit that all sacred texts were written by human hands and are thus the subject of interpretation, ideas, and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, which explain many of the contradictions and differences in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, rather a mutual comment.
We have to show again that there are two different authors here whose work has been somewhat humorous together during some editorial audit.
It is true that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not a good witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five books of Moses and Moses do not attribute authority to any of them, since almost there was no such thing as the Bible describes it.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Esdraše) of a number of irrefutable oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were overfiltered at the same time and all were signed by human authors.
The Bible is not as old as her beliefs.
The witnesses from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds known for their inexhaustible foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Dridic cults, Chinese or Egyptian worship.
Christianity began as a Gnostic religion, followed by doctrines and Bionics and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were divided and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these regulations relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young worship of Moses, the authors of the New Law decided to laugh and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount" changed to the "Lord Much" in Belgium.
So the Bible was gradually and substantially altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the 4th century B.C.E. in a series of Commission decisions on film in Nicaragua.
The four Gospels were accepted, and the sixteen others were rejected by a mere raising of hands, such as if the reality of something was given to accept or refuse to vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in those Christian centers.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that it was close to the same Gospel accounts.
And so the nuclear canon emerged from the bonds of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as evangelism any relevant stories that prevailed among uneducated masses at that time.
However, more than ten books of the Bible were collected in the same way, even though they referred to books that were approved.
Among the items rejected are the letters of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was this real editor?
The Bible often mentions human writers.
But how could this be approved if God was the real author of this complicated mechanism of history, similarity, and sad lyrics?
Surely the Bible was written by men and certainly not by too much light!
That's why it's so large part of its historical and scientific content completely wrong, whether it's about anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that gods and gods could speak, believed in spirits, blood sacrifices, ritual formulas, miraculous objects, fire literature, astrology and five living magic.
They thought that if they use a blood transfusion, they'd treat it better.
We're talking about people who thought that the queens are rappers and the necrops are birds and the bears are fish and beer is a whole number.
These people believed that when they show pregnant cows, they give birth to crushed bodies.
How could anyone say this? Who knows anything about genetics?
The authors of this book certainly didn't know about it.
If the Bible had been written by some higher quality, it would not have contained the mistakes it contained.
If she had come from the peer she was really obsessed with the apartment and was thought to be a literal history, then she wouldn't have anything to do with what she's saying.
As a moral guide, it is generally common because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and greedy wild beasts who observed or supported cruelty against animals, insects, children, abuse of children, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, child abuse, loss, murder, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To provoke their ignorance by claiming to seek God's will.
But creativeists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites claim that if there is any truth in conflict with the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their favorite books, they wouldn't even have God.
There's one and the other in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "the act of creating instead of the Creator".
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and the god of themselves, and they even insist that their rendering of their "holy" books is probably some sort of God who is as good as such.
No version of them is God, but all versions of God.
The creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and that the Bible could be corrupted at the same time, for it cannot be separated from the divine doctrine.
So it is about a kind of prayer where believers worship man - made compilations, such as if these books were the same God because they think they are Jehovah’s Word.
Because God has never recorded or quoted any of the scriptures of any religion.
All that people have acknowledged or rejected in their supposedly "invisible word" of any god has been designed, constructed, assembled, translated, interpreted, corrected, and often changed and overridden by only imperfect humans.

The participants in the call made their way out of the chair
When she fell on her head with ice water, Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom cried out to her for damage to the structure of her facial bones.
This white challenge didn't come up.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried out to the white ring to clear her forehead.

A refugee in a Chinese school beat up nine people, three of whom died
A man named Čchen, according to the agency New China, got into a basic school early in the morning, and about half of the local time he was arrested.
Three of the nine who won later died in the hospital.
Čechen later killed himself by a jump from the top, introduced New China with reference to the regional government.
In recent years China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.

The first Germans in Länech showed how he had to sit in school
At least nine schools took students to their classes, where they were waiting for the president's arrival with the teacher.
Then he showed the kid how he had to sit in the school by himself.
"We've had to sit behind the back with our hands, it's no longer your luck, you're already free people," said the child Zeman.

In time, he was promoted to the hockey competition in Lithuania.
"They were the first, so I accepted an invitation to participate in the beginning of the school year," the minister added.
The Minister of School Marcel Chladek (ČSSD) started a school year in private sports schools in Lithuania.
In the first three years there were 115 thousand initials.
Over 850 000 children will go to primary schools and over 405,000 students will be taught in secondary schools, reports the Ministry of Education.

Apple iCloud probably looked down on hackers, got our photos of celebrite
Screenshot of the printout of isolated files
While an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic pictures of American celebrites, the US server Mashable.com warned.
He probably got incorrect access to user accounts on the Applu servers, where the user's achievements were replaced by automatic recording of the iPhones and iPads images.
Apple hasn't solved the problem yet.
Some celebrite rejects photos as faked but has already acknowledged several of the rights of the images concerned.
Among them are Hercules Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss's title in the series of Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in Death Fall 4.0.
The goal of hacker is to use the photos and videos obtained to enrich.
In fact, American newspapers have shown interest in the events, according to a report on the 4chan server, but hacker wants more money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely to be weak in the security of iCloud.
On the GitHub server the same tool appeared two days ago, which allowed you to get passwords to user accounts through the hard force, so by automatically reverseing attempts to sign up with different passwords.
This tool was clearly working, but Apple shut down the security tower two days later.
However, it is true that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the publication of this tool.
Users of iCloud should therefore for preventive reasons change their password associated with Apple ID.
It's important for a long word, not its complexity.
It is appropriate to have at least 12 characters.
The only direct images to celebrate are to be considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the company's servers such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, which are much safer than computers in households or smaller companies, are uploading sensitive photos in an unsecured form of risk.
If you want to post an explicit photo online or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also wise to set up an automatic photo storage from the phone so that it can only run on Wi-Fi and after connecting to the provider.
Thus you will have the opportunity to move sensitive photos "to security", and you will mainly have space to reduce the unspoken images, so they will not take the space online.
The guide on how to encrypt files and communications online, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book by Michala Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
Wise How to Save for High School Script
In view of the fact that the price for high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, an emerging student of the second year came in a wise way to reduce costs.
He designed a system to borrow books from senior officials with a nominal compensation offer to maintain their return.
"The book of calculations, which is usually $180, I got ten per semester and for cooking needles," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covent College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would still be $430, he says.
Utratil 120.
According to the University Council, the average student will lose more than $1,200 per year, but students have different options for managing these costs.
The preferred choice of students is to become online businesses and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
At the entrance is the rent of a school, which allows students to use the book semester, often with an excellent discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, who is conducting more than 250 bookshops in the area of campuses, says that the book rental has doubled since 2011.
A study in the department shows that around a quarter of the books in university libraries were in the past year's season of loans, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the training texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Business in University Bookshops.
There's 101 of the best ways to make it.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be on the Internet up to a third lower than in the university library.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” Rona Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteller is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new $239.99 on Chegg.com, in retail specializing in the school.
Buy Used
If you are not aware of other people’s or needs and habits, the appropriate means of learning are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that at Amazon.com he paid for the used edition "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new one was sold for $48.
University student Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students in their students should check whether older versions are acceptable.
Sometimes there are no changes to work in seminars.
If so, older issues can be sold at the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a favorite option for buying used books as well as eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
It is also worth considering that if you deal well with them, you will not forget to return them and you will not need them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the costs for a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $2.
List out the terms and conditions of the trade in which you borrow the book, including the position of the mark, expression or use and damage.
Remember: If you do not return the book at any time, the account may be higher than the price of the new books.
E-book
Another option is to watch instead of the normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are mainly purchased in the form of electronic licenses available after a certain period of distributions such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, these most suitable offers can be found by students of literary courses, since many classes are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, you're going after business.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends running by ISBN because it guarantees that you're buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the Internet, make sure it's really ready, Gault does.
He was convinced of his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university library.
Bahno, same bahno.
And then they found it in a study bag of guns from the end of the war.
This study is a visit from the Church of St. Jiří.
We discovered growth around us and began to extract the flying nose - a rough meter and a half yards and a dry leaf.
As we got closer to the yellow bottom, we got hit by the head," said Radomil Novak.
We took her out, cleaned her up and found out that it was a bunch of German attack rifles used by SS units.
Well, it's probably unusual.
According to my information, such guns were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three thousand of them," Novak added.
All wood construction materials were disintegrated from time to time, so it's useless.
Her body is all preserved - she keeps her face.
How do you feel?
There's one explanation.
Maybe people who needed to get rid of weapons used by SS units were there, probably afraid they wouldn't be fired.
The fascists on the run wouldn't have done it.
You threw weapons into the woods," they think they find.
The gun was the only thing the students found from the Holy Spirit of God in the study.
"There could have been hand grenades, those were always around here, so we missed the funeral work, and we were careful about the mess so there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novák approached.
The study ends at the museum's depository at the castle in the nearby Slysky Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the Czech Republic
Exclusive conversation Currently.cz with General Colonel Volodumyre Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Russian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... call me from Donécka," said about eight times during an exclusive conversation with Current.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, also director of the local Centre for the Liberation of War Workers.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
At any such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban would tell his opponent at the second end of the phone.
"That'll be it--go over there," he concluded one of the bloc discussions with Donnick and remarried ours.
Reuben's Volodymur is a general base, a pilot of strikers and an active participant in anti-government protests in Midian.
Yesterday - when we had a conversation - he was in Donic.
The release of Ukrainian soldiers from the occupation of the Russian separatists is committed to four thousand hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that the Russian separatists are also fighting Chechnya.
Our counterstudent calculates their number to thirty.
It can be a lot more.
Have you met a Czech employee at your meetings?
Vodomymyr Ruban: I've already released Serbs, Dagestance, Chechnya, one of Sweden, Georgia... but Chech still hasn't.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we were to attack your prisoner and could release him.
Ukrainian army occupied by separatists
A.cz: What do you do to the Czechs who join the Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if they, like Czechs, fight in the Ukrainian ranks of volunteers and separatists take them, they will be shot without mercy, just like any other stranger.
The separatists consider these men to be tenants and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take up a group of Donatian separatists - and there is also a need for Czechs - then they place it behind the grid and treat it as a military prisoner.
This guy's a short life.
The Ukrainian side is also in war as a state.
A.cz: And how much has it been possible for you to save Ukrainian employees?
If I understand it well, I'll change it.
Some sources say it's been over a hundred men for a long time.
We've been counting on how many people we've helped.
But we just released them... they didn't save them before the war if they decided to continue in fear.
The rescuers are in the medical war, the surgeons, but we're definitely not.
That's right.
And every day they get more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one or four or five.
And it's not always about exchange.
Sometimes it's enough to let go of employees and just a human request.
A.cz: It's reported that in a few months, you've gained great authority and even trust in the Russian separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officials in Kyiv gave me a look at "a crazy general with eyeglasses."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe it's also the basis of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Deputy Congregation, I've already received some authority.
I never cheat, I don't give up, I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government or the Dutch or Luhanian very uncomfortable.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're suffering and killing them.
And they're crimes.
I'm often at risk of life, even if I'm in the exchange of employees and employees... this job can mean the end... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How much do you know about repair and torture of employees?
... (long silence) The Ukrainians are also separatist in the hearings to torture the prisoners.
I'm sorry.
What about repairs?
They're only playing on the bottom side.
I don't have any information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also fixing the loan.
Not even signs of the Ukrainian army being allowed to do something like that.
We have an idea of the amount of correction, but I can't give the number and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characteristics and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
It's trying to be independent and perhaps democracy in Doneck or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play any more games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their incalculable resistance - to life and death.
As we say, they ate them up to their throat.
The same dreams and complaints were passed through the village of Midian.
And now I'm a little suspicious: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the other hand, the Ukrainian state.
One speculative thinks it's big and the other it's small.
I'm already here, but there's an incalculable dispute in it.
A.cz: How does one of the strongest leaders of the Russian separatists Igor Bezler, for example?
Every time I cross the lines of war fronts, I don't have any weapons and I'm showing soldiers or armed men broken hands.
And I always have both sides of these two seats or three hundred meters on a man or an optical observer.
Those faces of people who care about me, I can see every good thing... and they can always shake their arms.
A helicopter experienced by a Colonel with German and Ukrainian precedents.
He is considered a Russian official, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it's just like a small government in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it, and Ukraine considers what kind of misunderstanding has occurred.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an incalculable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we're talking about characters - in a discussion show of Ukrainian TV you named your Prime Minister Arsenija Jacenuka as a weak, unskilled "leader", who would do the best if he left quickly.
In these three hundred yards of hair I'll always get at least five times.
So why should I be silent about the fact that Jacquenuk is a very poor prime minister and that it damages our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians of Jacquenuk look like "the Queen."
And the king is not in the eyes of Ukrainians an animal from which he would be afraid or should have respect and authority.
His behavior directly copys the Queen's behavior.
Maybe it's a good economy, but as prime minister, he doesn't have the right to cry in Parliament, ask him to play his intrusion with him, threaten that he's in charge... he has to run the country, fix it and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, there is no premium on family, friends, rest on payee emotion.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
What about Jacenuku?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yeah, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never strong... he doesn't fight for Ukraine, but he's always complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
As in the past, it's better for Ukraine.
Why Galaxies Could Not Save Markets
The 3 Sylvester Stallonee returned from a nine hundred million budget in the United States less than 30 million dollars and Sin City: Jenska, for which I would have killed only 12 million dollars.
The movie Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first week and also films for children like how to train dragon 2 were for cinematour.
According to an article in the film critic Robbie Collina in Telegraph, children’s films are about their own quality.
Collin marked 2014 as "lower" year of child films and how to train dragon 2 called it "functional" only.
When it comes to films placed on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem must not be in the quality of the films itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared cinemaScore and Metacritics servers and their average annual film premiums sent at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of viewers and film critics indicate that the annual film level is similar to the long-term hits.
According to some commentators, there can be a change in the way viewers approach and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Fabreau, who is currently working on Disney's work on the Young People's Book, told Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We have to let it go and don't try to be ashamed of what's already happened.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash markets crisis, Netflix was won by online services of $1.2 billion, which is almost twice as much as $837 million in length.
Last year, director Steven Spielberg criticized the study because they relied too much on the rights of the commissioners, and he warned Hollywood about the "injury".
In the light of the current explosion, some commentators claim that there can be something on his catastrophic scale.
With the introduction of possible large cash markets in 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimón and the Jurska world, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
Manufacturer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked the fall in markets for a simple "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter, he said: "The next summer will be the largest cash markets in history and no one will worry about sales."
KLDR again threatened Soulu, fired another short flight rocket
North Korea fired another short flight rocket into the sea, announced Soul.
A certain missile test was carried out shortly after the United States and South Korea joint military maneuvers were completed, which Pchjongjang considered to be an invasion preparation.
The province of Čagan lies in the northwestern KDLR border with China.
The spokesman of the South Korean Ministry of Defence according to the DPA Agency stated that the shots were fired from the northwestern KLDR and flew 200 kilometers away.
North Korea was apparently the first to fire a rocket from the province of Čagang, bringing the South Korean media to withdraw from the army.
In the province there is a underground fire ramp for Scud-type rockets.
It is another of the series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in the last few weeks.
North Korea has performed an extraordinary amount of rocket and missile tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, the NATO summit protest was held in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the center of Newport to participate in NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to Cardiff's office for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the situation during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be airborne from Blue Mountains
DVA young tourists were taken out of the plane and transported safely after spending the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and 18-year-old man went out on a tour to Govets Leap in Blackhead.
When they didn't come home, the neighbors called the police about eight o'clock in the evening.
She was sent by a patrol number, including the local police and a rescue team, and a couple were found around 11 o'clock in the evening near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl ran down her knees and the man fell down and then fell to his head.
The police stayed with them through the night and were taken out in the morning.
In the stabilized state, they were transferred to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought from Opavay only point, the game was on the foot of Vashček
The 23-year-old forvard could have decided in two biggest chances but failed.
After all, she called mostly about three minutes before the end, a place on the network but ended up at the bank of the Joseph Quatton.
I had it on my feet, so I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," he fell asleep on his head.
"If I had to put it up under my neck, I had a little bit of sit down," he confessed.
Sigmy's defense did not allow Opave much, except for Mikul's 11-minute ride, which, however, covered the huge Reichl.
Then they started to press Hanác, but in the chance they didn't let the guards down in the block and shot out of the distance he got Quéton.
We compared 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
The second time we were better, we had more games and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the shot shot didn't change, and it ended at 0:0," said coach Hanák Leoše Kalvod.
The punishment was also due to the absence of a unit where, in addition to two injured persons, Peter Vavrík was missing with triangular shooter Petre Ševček who are staying in Slezska from Sigmy.
This did not allow them to become independent of their previous policies.
Rewarders deserve absolute authority.
Sigma made football, but until one standard we didn't let her go," said the coach of Slézanós Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of tension, aggression and war.
The remiza is probably deserved, the point is for us to pay attention," he added.
Sigma's remigma got on four points, which means 13 places.
Nothing could ease Joseph Lebra's head club, which, after his defeat with Znojm, has made his millions of deposits into a richly different performance in other stocks.
"We realized Mr. Lébra's warning, so it can't be about the boys wanting to fight," Kalvoda noticed, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter, "I believe it's coming and when it's raining, it's going to fall there.
But after the first step, I'll shoot him right away so he can shoot his balls on other tapes," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino overrun Benatky twice.
Film Festival otherwise survives the crisis
After a huge surprise at the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Innárrit met together among serious candidates at the Golden Lava, the following days showed that he was interested in 71th annual festival in Benátakás some time.
Whether the number of seats in the largest room has increased to fourteen, or because the criticisms have been followed by Birdmans, but for the viewers less attractive pictures of genocide in Indonesia in the 60s I see silence and other films with a social theme from the American 99 houses after Iran's announcements, there has been a short stay of empty seats in the cinemas.
Chemistry of comics
Not even the red cube before the festival hall had been reduced by such taxes as in the past and probably ceased to be the problem of finding a place in the hotel for the last time.
The crisis in Italy is more than any other, and it's not surprising that there have been such well-known institutions as Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
The tragedy of the crisis is not a lack of personality, but it is extremely important in connection with the film.
While young fans reported on the autographs of the comical superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles throughout 99 homes, for all generations, it became the main event of the visit of legendary priest Ala Pacin.
He's got two more shots right now.
In the story of the Enlightenment, which was mentioned outside the competition that the archaeologist Barry Levison, according to the novel Philip Rotha, has a 14-year-old Pacino role that is close to him: the hero at the top of the glory that suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him on the second day as a unique railway owner from a foreign city in the Manglehorn film that David Gordon Green discovered, it was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpio's food for the best herke performance should not be missed - but his artist still needs a price in Pacin's format?
Perhaps it is the greatest satisfaction of the public's love for him, and in particular for Italy, because although born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his ancestors come.
Body for Italy
The last time the Italian film is being held in Benatach this year, it's very good.
The black soul, which ruled Francesco Munzi, became the first picture of Birdman, the long-responsive creature.
The calabrian ratio mafia is taken into account by a view of the family relations between clans that fight each other about power and money, and the director was able to follow all assumptions for good film: quality scenario, camera, music and herce.
He also occupied a roomy psychothriller cold heart that found Severio Costanzo and Albo Rohwwarcher in the role of a woman who at least loses her own child.
On the other hand, the French competitive films did not expect to receive a warm reception, nor did 3 hearts, both of which were inspired by the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of heretic representatives.
But finally, two really exciting films, so Birdman and Black Souls, aren't at the first half of the festival so small.
And perhaps festival photos have all over the world depressive objects, a new picture by Peter Bogdanoviche named She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy mentioned in the Benatachs, despite the competition and set up in the style of the American holidays of the 40th century, has been able to invite the event for more than one day.
Police arrested four pervitin producers in Prague, took drugs from Poland
"In recent days, three men aged 42, 42 and 37 years and a 50-year-old woman who produced and sold pervitin drugs in Prague 9" said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First of all, on Tuesday, 12 July, the rape unit in the Ciclářářá street caught a 20-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who was listed in the group as buying medicines in Poland and selling a dose.
The following day the detectives held on the basis of the previous agreement of the representative of another member of the group, which is a seven-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers hit the middle early 20th of August in the area of small fuel," she said.
A woman received a third of the drugs for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a broad field of competence.
In a part of the summer area, in a garden house in Horoméric, in the Konov Street and elsewhere on Prague 9, he produced pervitin, supplied various aids and chemicals needed for his production and provided transportation of drugs with pseudoefedrin from the Polish Republic.
He continued to weigh the drug produced, distributed it into plastic bags and then sold pervitin.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, he was helped by a 50-year-old, still a woman who was not depressed.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third drug produced," Rössler added.
Criminals also carried out a number of domestic inspections on the basis of the order of the judge, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, payloads, injection syringes, hats and other aids and articles which, according to experts, can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been tortured seven times since 1995
"The police found out from the available evidence that since 1995, the main organizer has been sentenced to a total of seven times as a result of his or her own criminal activity, the woman has not been prosecuted," the police spokesman added.
The last one was detained in 2006 on condition that he was convicted of a criminal offence and a seven-year-old auto mechanic who was released was sentenced to nine sentences since 2009.
And it was a major crime for him.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a crime of illicit production and other control of drugs and psychotropic substances and food, which is a threat to them up to a decade of imprisonment.
To three persons he finally gave the investigator to the national representative and appealed to the motion for a ruling where the judge finally settled," said the speaker.
The fourth defendant, a seven-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as important as those of the other accused.
Police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wooden and carbon chips.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for many "interested" prices.
As a good example, a hand-made chess in Italy with a playboard of size 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, get over $40,000.
The direct price is 43 405 Kč.
The customer shall obtain fruit of wood black and redly laminated figures placed in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
It's not surprising to anyone that instead of a classic driver, players have a horse-repetition figure.
If you do not think chess is a valuable gift enough, you also need Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course manually) at 1:1,8.
The price of this game makes 318 305 Kč.
The destruction of gymnasiums and high school doesn't make any sense.
In addition, the Czech Republic has a small number of educated people and statistics show that Gymnasians have good applications.
It's the beginning of the school year.
In schools in the last fourteen days, great preparations were made.
Most of the routine concerns, such as the transfer of flowers from the annual position back to the class and the markings.
They're going to have a little bigger fruit.
A few days before the start of the season, they scan the contents, computers and other technical equipment and literature into the library.
The four-year gymnasium in Horíči opened and resumed its activity after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the depositors.
They had to wait for confirmation of the school's existence by bringing it into the MSMT school register.
"The French socialists should shut down and put France in order," says the key link between Francoise Holland
Walls calls for a strong left-wing to "show her support" to the war-affected socialist president whose new division of functions was not in agreement with the majority of the French.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay on his side," he said and closed his pocket.
As a peaceful gesture, the President of the Government held that his Government would not question the controversial French thirty-three-hour working week and that despite the overwhelming achievements of Emmanuel Macrona, the new finance minister who proposed at the beginning of the week to set the rules free.
On Saturday, Holland asked socialists to remain "constant" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, Minister of Justice, but made a point of congratulating him over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist envoys where she criticized the Socialist party for "the French lost faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, a leading extremely conservative right, laughed at the ongoing internal disputes between socialists when she declared that it did not predict that the new Walls government would last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is a nobleman and Prince Manuel Walls. They were also granted a new government when the past did not last until the end of the year.
"And the new will not last until the end of the winter or the winter," Le Penv said to his contractors.
She reiterated her call to Parliament for a resolution and declared that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered in the early municipal elections and in May the extreme conservative right was successful in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion study in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk that it will be divided into several rival groups even before the end of the 2017 period.
Pascal Perrineau, political scientist of the University of Sciences Po, warned that French people would soon be suffering if the new socialist government could not improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"This is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hazard and street art are no longer confined to choice
The amendments to the relevant declarations should be prepared and approved until new management of the capital.
From the streets of Prague, other heroes do not disappear before municipal elections and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no restrictions on the marriage of dogs.
Prague will not arrive at the October elections to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant declarations.
"The decision to change should also not be made by the current management of the city which will end within a few weeks," said the consultant Lukaš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, a number of workers, such as Prague 5 and 7.
Hern, but he's not going to disappear. The emergency report will not change until it's over.
It's the task of a new city after elections.
Now we wouldn't even technically take this into account, for example, the length of the reminder and similar," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the present representative, which must be approved by the amendment of the statement, was on 11 September.
The referendum on a flat ban on gambling is held on the day of municipal elections in the city parts of Praha 1 and Praha 8.
At the present time there is a ban on gambling, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the complaint will not be changed in the case of street art, so-called "busing".
He is particularly concerned about Praha 1, which has already sent the master of a site proposal which she would like to extend to the current list of prohibited places.
The singers also don't want Praha 5 around Angel.
The list of dog marriage regulations for the city will last several months, but it is not yet completed.
The location of the heren and the problem of the bushing solves the city's statements.
It can only be issued or managed by the representation of the capital.
The councillors only have an advisory vote, they must not make statements themselves.
Last week he gave the victory to the advocates of Scotland's independence on the reach of the hand
The Scottish campaign for independence was in danger of making this mistake when she put at least on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether Scotti wants to be rich.
But you don't get to the heart of Scottish voters by calling on their money, or you don't get their respect when you start threatening them.
The moral of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although only a few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to avoid shifts from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knew this well, and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect "the will of the Scottish people", if the Scottish voters would vote for independence and start a single exchange for Scotland and England.
This Darlinga used to love the Scottish civil society and the London financial system, and he fell into this trap with the grimas.
Of course Darling doesn't support sending Scottish voters.
However, this debate on what will have a Scottish currency has already been largely neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fervor, the job opportunities and the protection of public health, which are free of charge.
Darling supported the London banker in my case and also called for the opinion that he would not protest against the privatization of health.
By saying, "He went into bed with a condom."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish volunteer knows that Scots businessmen are in a condom bed.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke nothing to the voters in Scotland but to the "boss" association of the British industry confederates.
It becomes clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmonde was a serious mistake for the Union's campaign.
Cameron looks like a crazy housewife.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland can be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that. It's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not to jump and they have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic beginning of school according to Miloše Urbana
Illustrations to tell next year
Miloš Urban Next year
The end of the holiday was the best, the last week that I had never eaten before, and we just had lunch and we had dinner with my grandmother in summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
A new dress when it was made from Tuzexu, boots from East Germany.
The reading of the Quick Ships, already falling to the top of the empire, to the back of the Empire, to the back of Vary, to the tennis courts, there was no longer a veil, the sun colded behind and the shoulder, the paper was rolled up on the loose.
A calm night of nervousness, still in holiday mode, sleeps up to half a week, will be up in the week, moments before I wake up from a few minutes to two hours, then get up in the morning at half a week.
He's coming tomorrow.
Most of the time, however, this summer, it's getting worse in front of school.
To serve in air-light on the plate and to appear like a plastic stand in a glass of gravity, there is this school, U.S.A.
An old famous face also has a few new, better keys, more attractive girls.
There are horrors, to avoid them, it's just as interesting as it's innocent to keep a job and how fast they're here.
And these grown-up girls who came to call are now smiling at something hysterically, maybe something changed in their lives over the holidays while I'm all around the old man.
And again new starters, some nerves and other pleasures, why are they even here?
Because they have to, uh, teach the military.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the schoolmate with the mope, still regrets the same thing as it buys a key from the back desk where they are allowed to leave the classrooms and which are still so small.
For a bottle.
The smell of the hat remains in memory, now it's not done, it's pretty aired, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
It's just that the stomach is playing out and it's starting to hurt its head.
The head that's still up to learn from mathematics, the devil's games for free, between which I don't belong and I'll never be.
Again the three and four, the nobility of the fifth, hide before the test, enter into the lavender and bestly sublimate, be there and not, exist only as a name in the classroom and enjoy the stories of nice girls and beautiful buildings, the antennas into the universe where no one competes with anyone, does not humiliate anyone and does not support anyone's feet.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's the first day, like years ago.
The born daughters were allowed to die.
She is threatened with extraordinary punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 at the office of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any foreign help, she was born into a girl who, after swallowing a doll, hid under her bed and took her to a road guidecar, where she put her in a few dozen yards from the road.
I was born on my way to school.
It came to me a while ago.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom in the bus. I was born there.
She was born alive. She looked at me.
I broke my popcorn ring with the legs I had taken to school," she said to the complainant and said that she was pregnant.
"The next day she returned to the place, the child's body was put into the bag and taken away, the body was taken out of the bag, wrapped in a black needle bag and hid and left under the shelter in her grandmother's house in Havličkova Boat," she complains that it is not quite obvious when it came to the death of a newborn.
It could be in ten minutes, but even a couple of hours after birth, breathing when hiding a baby or putting under a band, swallowing or bleeding from an uncooked doll.
A similar scenario was repeated the next year on the stage.
A woman near undiscovered from February to June 12 when the child was found by innocent witnesses at the port of Havličkobrodsk, was born on her own.
This time in a bathroom under the roof of the family home.
Before she realized that she was born alive, without shooting, and she had a doll that was surrounded by the breast, she put the child into several plastic lakes, including Igelitan bags, and left it in the bathroom.
Next in the afternoon, he was taken to the fishermen together with this partner.
She was finally married by a friend.
The father was just a friend of the two children who complained but apparently did not know about the strengths of the partner.
Even for that reason they are not present before the court, only he has been convicted of a violation of the funeral law.
It was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not stressed out as a partner.
He was manipulating my baby against my expectations.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it came to me right now as a human," she did not hide her regret, which was likely a man's fault and feared it.
During her speech, a young woman spoke quite well.
Sly took her to her eye until the moment she spoke about her relationship with her parents, which she left after she reached adulthood.
She didn't want to kill me.
"He goes after me every 14 days on a visit, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't use my training because I didn't want kids, I seemed young.
I just wanted to get him into my baby box, but I don't know what happened because I didn't do it.
I can't explain it to you," she answered the judge's question.
She refused, however, to deal with the thought and the intention of killing a newborn.
The second child, according to her claim, was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I've been smoking too," she said.
Despite her pregnancy in both cases, she claimed that she had a health problem that she was pregnant.
And that's my friends.
The main calculation will be continued by the Court of First Instance in the hearings of the Court of First Instance.
In the middle there could already be a judgment.
A woman is threatened with a criminal sentence of up to 18 years in prison, perhaps with an exceptional burden.
Norwegian Cruise closes to the three billion repurchasing company Prestige Cruise
According to sources known as the whole, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third largest shipowner in the world, in agreement with Prestige Cruises International Inc., has moved around three billion dollars.
The sale by Norwegian Cruise, a company with market value of $6.8 billion, which is opposed to increased competition between Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) has enabled access to the luxury cruise ship Prestige Cruises and the rich customer.
The agreement may be published this week, delivered on Sunday, but warned that the meeting must not be completed successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns twenty percent share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because they are not public.
The representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for a comment, the speaker Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise sails in Miami on thirty sailing ships in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's acceptance in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises is under the marks of Ocean and Regent, which together include eight sailing ships flying in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced a market of $1.2 billion, 6 % more than last year.
It is expected that in the coming year, the nine billionth segment of vacation swimming pools will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India.
The companies compete to become preferred options for these customers in the selection of vacation swimming pools.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public tender in January 2014 at the US regulatory authorities.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the closing of the trade in 850 million dollars.
Norwayan Cruise has been in its current form since 2000, when it came to meet with the operator of the flight swimming pool owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of companies operating in free time and casinos controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
The Norwegian Cruise company introduced the stock market in January 2013.
According to the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned 28 % capital, Apollo 20 % and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documents, the first public tenders include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise total 82% of North American passengers.
The prodemocracy activists in Hong Kong day after the vote decision provoke the Chinese authorities
Next came a group of loyal people to Beijing who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National Human Congress agreed on Sunday that only two of the three candidates in Hong Kong should be present in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointing committee, which will likely be composed of faithful Beijing members.
Therefore, it is almost impossible for opposition democracy to get to the electoral lists and to allow pro-democratic activists to renew promises and protect the Hong Kong financial centre of the "Central Procurement" protest.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, Chinese leading representatives fear that the demand for democracy will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published in June a detailed report on Chinese official rights in Hong Kong, democratic activists organized an informal referendum on elections in the special office, and hundreds of thousands of people entered and included in the city's commercial district.
The press conference held by Prime Minister Li is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, several press conferences were also to be held by the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and the Vice-President of the State Council of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei.
The students announced that they would meet in front of the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong before the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago.
Putin asks Kyev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on "State sovereignty"
According to the Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start the "State sovereignty" negotiations on remote areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not mean that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reviewed so that the Russian-speaking area would have the right to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's challenge of the Kyiv government to deal with the Russian rebels as if they were equal, is consistent with the apparent strategy that led to the expulsion of the peacekeepers five months ago: Help separatists to occupy the territory and give the Ukrainian government a new declared New Russia's actual independence so that the place could be connected to Russia instead of the West.
In a speech for the first state television channel Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions that were to regain the eastern regions of Donécka and Luhansk, which ruled separatists in March and April after Moscow anectotes the Crimean Poles belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
Kremlin and separatist recently occupied territories have been designated as ‘New Russia’ or ‘New Russia’, a term referring to the glorious days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, which say everyone believes that peaceful action is in view of the fact that Ukrainian politicians began before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government authorities are attacking civil society in areas dominated by separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must start a meaningful conversation without delay, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the Statute of State Sovereignty of South-East Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's attack on state sovereignty was thought to be in the context of a wider autonomy, which, with the leadership of Kyev for several months, should alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov pointed out that the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not about the issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about the internal Ukrainian conflict."
The closure of the speech Kremlin, which was to correct the "inaccurate interpretation" of Putin's notes, highlighted Russia's approach to resolving the rise of separatists in the east, which is different from the open containment of Crimea, where most of the two-million people are headed by ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had much more difficulty to announce Doněck and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million citizens are not Russians and public opinion studies that were still under way in the face of the conflict have shown widespread support for Ukraine's service.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional government of Ukraine the right to determine its own commercial agreements and international relations and, in particular, to give Kremlin effective control over the territory that would link Russian stability with Krym.
The Black Sea peninsula anectotes five months ago is the seat of the main Russian marine fleet, the marine trade land and the historical coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Krym are also centrally low, factory and canal, which produce important components for the Russian army.
During its opening appearance on 7 June, Ukrainian President Pedro Porosenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution which would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy, however, is much different from the view of Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is charged with the development and entrepreneurship of violence.
Putinova’s last challenge is to treat Kyev as a separatist in the same way as himself following the next step of the rebels last week after the Russian units and tanks from the former rest of the region of the Azov Sea crossed east of Ukraine.
The separatists of Russia took control of Novoazov's forces so that Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that it is intended to contain strategic coastal territories to the Crimea.
This has intensified the enormous civil and military effort to rebuild Maripulol, a port with a metallurgy combination of 500,000 inhabitants located between the Novoazovian and the coastal border on the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday he appeared at the meeting of the leading representatives of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroschenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecific scale of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, speaking to the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday to reporters in Kyiv, said that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilova after two weeks of Russian-backed vehicles and 1,000 military units crossed the Danube to support the vulnerable separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were involved in the Russian invasion of Ilova were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian officers taken a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, on Sunday Lysenko.
There are also Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the scandal with isolated photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his frustration over the hacker who probably stole his intimate photos of his nephew Gabi Greco and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after which, in the largest scandal with hacked celebrite photographs, he got on the Internet a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrenc's wedding.
Hacker claims he's got sixteen pictures with a star with a Hungarian Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevigne, singer Rihanny, Ariany Grande and Lee Michel and heretic Kirsten Dunstov.
Because of the exemption from iCloud, personal photographs of Australian herpes Teresy Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski and Melbournce Greek also were publicly available.
There's 101 celebrites on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for a hand from Greece last month, said to the Confidential magazine: "It's unsatisfied."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information is given to steal and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, reported online news reporters that hacking is "unsteady" and those who have become its target are "degradable".
It's because hacker got thirty photos of Palmer with former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which he went up without a break at the pool.
Palmer's effect was, for example, in the love and honor film where he was her opponent, Liam Hemsworth.
The Palmer, the star of Chuck Strahowski's TV series and the sugar Punch Browning thriller didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrenc's TMZ said, "It's about a clear breach of privacy."
Herec Seth Rogen hacker on his Twitter criticised: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, disclosure of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy's football team approved Lebra, and no win.
Olomouc - Hromy and blocs, which co-founder Sigmy Josef Lébr sat on his underprivileged last week, are, it seems, past.
To be from Opava finally brings only the point for the no-franch regime.
The find and fight of the club's boss was only a little approved.
The money for the expenses could soon come to the club.
"I'm leaving another game like I talked about last week, but I'm even more optimistic," Lébr confirmed, although Sigma didn't win, her players convinced her of a better performance.
The fight and the tension we played mostly during the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In this case, I'm able to forgive that he doesn't win.
If we were to play like this from the beginning of the season, I'm sure we haven't won yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opave stopped the initial pressure of domestics, then the game ended and was better in the second half.
After Calvin’s victory, the believers were defeated, but they did not get their opportunity to fight, and they could not win.
The result of the network is not according to our idea.
We missed complete peace but only one changed chance," Lébr declared, who does not think that the change in the approach of photographers has only led to his extinction.
There must have been more aspects there.
Whether it's from my side, from the coach's side or from the fans," said Lebr.
With pressure, Sigma must count
The players didn't want to comment after the game in Opave from last week's event.
I'm trying to get these things out of my way.
I tried not to let it go," cut young banker Michal Reichl's head.
Then, without any comment, he left the question on Lebrov's statement from last week's attacker Václav Vášićek, who has not changed the biggest opportunity of Sigmy in Saturday's game.
But he's only gonna tell us a little bit about the pressure.
We're still under pressure.
Everybody wants to get us out of here.
Today we have shown that if we fight and run all over our ass, that's how it goes," he said.
Warnings Touched the Heart
Not even Mr. Leoš Kalvoda pointed out that the preparation for the event was not the easiest view of the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomoca last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the guys realized it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lebra's warning took them to heart.
Even though it wasn't before that they didn't want to fight and avoid it," said the Oomous trainer.
It was like today's first fifteen minutes.
It's been a long time before we compared ourselves to the firm and realized what the other league is about.
That it's not just about football, but mostly about that war," said Kalvoda.
There's no hope that Sigme will be working in the next game from the beginning.
"I'd really like to believe it," he added.
