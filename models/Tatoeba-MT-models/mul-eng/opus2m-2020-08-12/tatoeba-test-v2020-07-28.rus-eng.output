I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of the dog.
There was a girl at the party.
I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.
How did you get Tom's impression?
Why does he hate me?
It's enough to scare him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd smoke.
Stay here with them.
Avarya heard he didn't deserve to live.
He bought a bottle.
We're home already.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't take me for granted.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Get some snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you three hours.
I lost the exam.
Eat until it's hot.
So it had to be three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I told him to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Last week I moved to Boston to Tom.
Tom's pretty.
Tom didn't know Mary wanted to be ready.
I told him you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdotes?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what he has to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bike.
I'll pay now!
Do you want to sit down for a role?
I've been working all day yesterday.
They're rivals.
The coins were lying under the table.
She's leaving.
Help the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
The caravan of fifty-five warplanes moved about in the wilderness in a stuporous manner.
You must be ashamed of your own ignorance.
I talked to Tom about places.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not gonna try to convince you.
I knew Tom was missing.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
Why are you mad?
Tom didn't tell me how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you I had an allergic reaction to the arrhis?
I know how old you are.
I won't show him to anyone anymore.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to upset Tom.
I'll teach you.
I've got food.
He got to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to stop Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
The cosmonauts wear shoes.
Algeria is buying artillery weapons in Russia.
Tell Tom what happened?
Give me something.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
We're in Germany!
We spent the night under the open sky.
Don't stop the door.
When are you free?
Isn't that supposed to be October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who's this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Defense is one of five feelings.
What's wrong with you?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Because something's hiding from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you thought about your newborn name?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got sick of him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I've prepared you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do this.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The throat will be fixed.
He's so hot that he can't be.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where did you get so badly hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I've been waiting for them good news.
Distilled water is tasteless.
My father's in the garden now.
Harry works part-time in the local supermarket.
It's unlikely I'll be late.
I told them to be on their feet.
Tom said he was upset.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to get married to his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom locked the door in his bedroom.
I've known Tom for a few months.
You're unnecessary!
Tom plays very well on the script.
No one blames you.
The next year is the year of the King.
Tom's almost always taking a bath in front of the oven.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I'm saying.
Now I'm adding the last stitches.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have a book.
Tennis is the only kind of sport Tom has.
Come to the coast.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I slept right away.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember I love you.
As they claim, he's a killer.
Mary didn't want to put on Halloween an open suit, so she decided to dress like a woman.
Tom's undercover.
Tom waited three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I won't be like this anymore.
Every morning I go shopping.
The kids are getting it.
Tom refused to sign a document.
Tom didn't even freeze.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I've been watching how you're doing.
It has the ability to do math.
On the way to the election.
He's a new father.
The men were men then.
Swiss banks are very secret.
As soon as you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you can.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
The birth is near.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts were futile.
He's got another stick.
Please pay attention, I'm starting to listen to the patient now, and make sure that you have followed the correct procedure - you need to contact her tomorrow.
Please, Saul.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the ambar.
You're wearing your own eyes.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary's got?
You're late for school again.
What's your favorite casino?
So I didn't have to ask twice.
You have to go to Boston.
I'm excited.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you with Tom.
I'm tall enough.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings in his plan.
It's the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
Your face looks like you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I got to Harvard.
You're like an angry plastic.
I can't let him go alone.
That was Tom's window.
When Jesus allowed his followers to go into the herd of pigs, he demonstrated the inexhaustibility of God’s Law on unclean animals.
I'm Captain.
I think we're gonna be fine.
We had to come.
I've been wrong about this.
Today is my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's not worth it, I'll buy her.
I told him what to do.
She can't hear it.
It was a good movie.
You're a promo?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom stopped me from talking to you.
Who are you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave me a lot of anger.
The missing boy was known for his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She almost refuses to follow his advice because she does not like him.
Did you write it?
I know you're working on them.
I hope I can help you.
Do your parents know about this?
The officer sent a white box on the table.
That day I stayed home because the roof was raining.
Is there an appetite around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and reported my car was stolen.
We can discuss it later.
It's a little helpful.
The goats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak openly?
I work for a oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom applied Mary's milk to our milk.
He hurt his left hand.
She's Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is reduced by every year.
Dan didn't want to show off.
Can't you tell me anything about yourself?
Did you find the difference between these two pictures?
He never saw so many books gathered in one place.
You look a little tired.
Don't forget to call me.
It's a dirty language.
I'd never do that.
Please correct him.
You need to apply the ice-cream package to reduce the father.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another drink.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you for nationality?" "Argents."
Why are you so cruel?
I can do it better than you do.
Don't forget your sights!
I really think so.
The sun has fallen.
Tom's got his room in order.
Did you complain?
I don't love Tom very much.
That's why we're gonna have to change the plans.
Someone tried him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's your new Mary pay?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Can we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
You're the blame.
Tom told everyone that he was taken.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Bring her somewhere.
I was like this once when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Here you go.
It wakes up from deep sleep.
You're bigger.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do this.
I hope I see him on Monday.
Do you really want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girl on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why it happened.
We'll send them an opening.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard these promises before.
What did you and Tom do after the wedding?
I'm very uncomfortable.
As is often the case today, Mike was late for the meeting.
Tom told me Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These idiots violated a law that prohibited them from breaking the law.
It's not done yet.
John was so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his point of view.
I didn't give it to Tom.
They're going to be weird.
I know you're rich.
Bill put a hundred dollars on a trip.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom's got his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not gonna die.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to warm up.
He lived in the car and walked away.
Tell Him everything that's happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still do not know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's already had three days of toothache.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You kind of said it was yours.
Where did he buy these bottles?
Don't make me do this.
Why did you fall in love with me?
Tom usually goes to work on the bus.
Fadell went to school.
I used to work with Tom.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart's going to be more and more every time I see her.
Do I think so?
All except Tom, shoes.
She gives him everything he asks us to do.
Is it sold?
I'm going to get worse.
Do you have that much more?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It's just making the problem worse.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a funny baby in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can you take your car soon?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're soft.
There's some sugar in the package.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something really good has happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get into foreign affairs.
Who's in my son's football?
Tom's American accent.
I don't have any money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
It's dark to see.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She took care of her marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom's gone.
It's Wednesday now.
Live force.
I needed to make sure he'd come here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the cap.
Maybe we're going for a walk?
He's capable of mathematics.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of a cat.
I heard you're playing well on the band.
Did you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom speaks more French than ever.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You're not coming with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I've barely been able to sit on a trip.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fiction movies?
I make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house behind the wheel.
He was resurrected, and I didn't get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you in a pretty way now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 discounts.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle your job.
After Mary gave him a drink, she poured out a bottle of wine and took a firm step to get out of the restaurant, took a dead silence.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We've met them.
Tom's going to improve the line tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary together.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a credit.
The father of Tom, who's in prison, never writes to him.
It's expensive.
I haven't had any reports of him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we'd all meet a long time ago.
They're all interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of.
Please, just do everything I can.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
Here's what's called success.
It was so dark in the room that I had to take a break.
How many planes in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Have another drink, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young people grow up in the cold of winter.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why are they looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it worked.
It all sounds so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How many are you swimming in?
Bring me a mouse.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
You bought some candles?
Canada is a family of ice hockeys.
The brain is very complex.
They would agree.
Your Japanese good.
The door broke through the window.
Peacocks are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without hair, like a soup without salt.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
That's what happened today.
I saw how the car got human.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm up to death.
You know what your kids are doing right now?
Do you want her to stay?
He's shooting at her.
Please tell me I'm right.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Tom kept calling her.
Six is coming in front of the family.
I went to my grandmother's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man yesterday who was hanging out of the ice-cream.
I think Tom picked me up.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed that John was crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
You signed a contract?
I told Tom he had to talk to a lawyer.
They don't live on that bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of girlfriends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom - Antisemit.
What is your most powerful side of it?
Tom doesn't like it when they understand it.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song in the words of Nekleev, could she imagine that he was going to vote for the president?
There's a yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
It's always open.
The form must be there for two-thirds.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he couldn't.
Was Tom not in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants a kiss.
My favorite restaurant burned.
He's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep the kids away from the farm.
Let's talk about this tonight.
I have to do it.
They don't know French.
Let's go!
I knew what Jackson was doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants an archipelago oil.
That's how you're going.
Tom's getting a little drunk.
I barely understood it.
He's been avoiding seizures.
You can live in a big house, and you can't feel it all the same.
I hope Tom tells me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
That's better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can Tom give me a few words?
Don't smile like that.
When did Tom get arrested?
We're eating at 6:00.
The bull became a victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to talk to her for us.
Are you with us?
Give me a wish.
Tom's alive.
It may take ten years to lie in the water, but it won't become a crocodile.
Tom made a point that he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw what happened.
I don't think there can be any other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was stolen last week.
How do you always get that energy?
Put your signature here.
What a man!
So you bought it?
A man is as old as he feels himself, and a woman is as beautiful as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be enough.
Tom told Mary she was telling the truth.
You don't want a daughter yet?
I like to play down the river.
You can go with me.
That word is a great gift for us.
"How long?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom lived on his motorcycle and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him for ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his head.
Why do you want to go?
How's French going to be "to see"?
It wasn't that long.
What about your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to let you go.
You really think Tom's gonna be able to swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
They often say that every week in the world, it disappears in one language.
She's got a little advantage.
I thought we were talking about it already.
How angry my parents would have been if I had failed.
I'll burn my cat every day in the morning and in the evening.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before any changes to the existing code are made.
I don't have teeth.
I think you've done a great job.
Last night we had a lot of rain.
What did you bring Tom?
That's what I wanted.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's where he hurt her.
I need to tell you something about him.
What choice did I still have?
You should stay up there.
Back home earlier, Bill.
She sat on the chair and read the magazine.
Since then, crying has been forbidden.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you. I'm not talking to you. I'm confused.
You don't even think about it!
Beautiful in white, the house seems to be more.
I found it hard to find the original quote.
I didn't realize you had a sign with her.
What's the point of doing this?
What dog is yours?
You have to give him more time.
You didn't tell me Tom was speaking French.
Tom will be back in Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a film in French with English subtitles.
I'll eat.
I'm sorry, Tom played well.
He's just another vinity, and he never does.
Can you play on the band?
Tom came to Mary and woke her up.
"When are you coming back?" "It's all up to time."
How many people live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
At the end of my house construction, I was three years old.
I was upset.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his dinner.
I understood what was going on.
She said it's late.
Your parents are still living in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom won almost everything.
What would you want Daddy Moroz to take you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of the finale?
Why did you hurt me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
Captain told his men to shoot him.
Sit there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom prayed with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl and work like a bad one.
Let me start talking to her.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting at my desk?
It sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in the back.
Put him on the field.
I thought you found someone else.
There will always be a large number of vehicles on the road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has a brother or a sister.
He must have loved you.
It makes no sense to pretend that you're making me believe I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
After all, he's sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If it's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, it looks like he didn't know you.
I refuse to help him.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything other than the Bible?
Read to me the show in the basement.
What's this gentleman doing for himself?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Your parents know about this?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoebe is not to say thoughts above and below the knee.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the shock.
I don't know your name.
How many trips does he get to Boston?
What are the lyrics of this song?
Mary likes to see my brother.
The law on my side.
That's why I had to find where to live.
Tom and Mary were all morning.
The publication of the article was postponed until the day of the birth of the professor.
You got a phone call a few times while you were in your soul.
She came for him for money.
No bird has five.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
It must make its own decisions.
Count, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You've got your birthday soon.
Let's go.
I don't like those boots.
Tom's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think it's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
No doubt he's best suited for this job.
You're making it easy for me to work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Dedline's gone.
You look much like me.
You know who those men are?
Tom left the room, didn't say a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Are you finished?
Tom and Mary spoke at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will be opened.
How much do you need?
I came back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the last one?
I'd like to show you how this is going on.
I told Tom to come.
You've got a beer.
Mom taught me not to waste my money.
We could go on foot.
She ended up yesterday in the second half of the day.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a place for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I called for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important for you.
They all knew her.
We better stay.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm really hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's holding on to bad guys.
Why didn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they kill them.
They turned Tom off the life insurance device.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary are very popular.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They don't shoot me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's both begging you.
Tom was shocked.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you start telling Tom?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He shouldn't have done that.
The 12-hour journey has left me exhausted.
The boy slept in the middle of the night.
I said I stood up.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw how we did it.
He came back two days later.
Tom's back in the morning.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are praying.
Eda!
Did you help him break the window?
It's out of my powers.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm out here.
Don't tell him what happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
Then what are you gonna say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get out of here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I broke the sword.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me today, and advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She got married to him when she was 20 years old.
I can't give anyone that word.
Give me that box.
They're saying his father died abroad.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I don't have time to do this today.
Mary told him what would help him.
Multiplicity of "person" is "people", not "persons".

I think that's why I had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me the name of the boy.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone's weak.
I hope you're paid well.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
That book was interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I'll see. I'll be late.
Your children know French?
Tom called and ran out of the room.
This soup will give you fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I was teaching French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, speaking with fear from the viewpoint of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of Aramaic rather than the heretics, thus showed the inconsistency of claims of the existence of any sacred language that is particularly close to God in prayers.
So Tom thought about it.
I think it's easy to be different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's doing.
The weather forecast didn't go wrong.
Tom, obviously, no one knows.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a glasses.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in my soul.
You remind me of a young man.
Tonight, Tom's out on the desert.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing for a little bit.
I thought you were a vision.
Tom got up early.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in his room.
It's important to breathe.
You already called Lucy?
A good idea came to her mind at the last moment.
It's a very thin air in this room.
Why aren't you in the suite today?
Font is a unit of weight.
I'd never talk to him again in your place.
Japan consumes a lot of books.
It's very hard.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be very busy.
And I'm very glad to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
The guy's a routine job.
Who else on your list?
Don't give him my phone.
I already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
The children of Tom must have been lying about him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
That's what you saved me?
He was very brave in sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom knew Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do this.
Please stop messing around.
Grandfather always said there's gonna be days like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.

Why won't you be tomorrow?
We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I never worried about them.
He was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I live with Tom.
Your voice is confused.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will benefit you a lot.
Tell him to be here for half a third.
It's not God's knowledge of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't talk to her.
I'm afraid there'll be rain.
You want a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the brink of starvation.
I've learned so much about my mistakes that I'm thinking about doing a few more!

I've made some adjustments.

Come to me.

Why did she do that?
Tom's got her?
I finally got to work.
Tom on the kitchen, my crew.

Tom won't ask me to do this.
I want to be like him.

The bus was overloaded.
Where do you want to go to the next exit?
How great is that?
I'm hungry.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is good for sale.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't deal with us like that.
His words hurt me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know he had to do it.
Give her a call from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer is all gone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in answer?
I'm leaving before I go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I'm dreaming.
That's why we don't work for anyone except ourselves.

Tom's calling Mary.
It's my favorite song.

He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we break it!

Tom threw Mary's keys.
I'm always talking to him.
I can't laugh at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the enthronement of Jesus Christ as King of kings and priests.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Every one of us went home.

Tom is not able to find satisfaction in life.
I want you to ask me a word.
I don't like anyone.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
- "Tom in the course." - "Yes, you told him?" - "No, he knew it all by himself."

Are you happy?
That's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.

We must respect their wishes.
How did you treat her?
I was already in Sapporo.

Would you buy that?
Tom's late on the plane.
She'll always get up early.
Do you want her to help you?

Come on!
I have to go further.
She called with her nose to the glass.

There's nothing to hide.

What did you find?
Can you explain this to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.

I'm on the ladder.
It's the largest car in the world.
Tom's almost never asked why.

Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've done it already.
What's the deal?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Aren't you gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know I'll always love you.

She was crying.

You're both idiots.
You like living out of town?
How long have you been here?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's manager.
Who are you planning on going to Australia?

Give me the cigarette.
Do as they told you.
Please watch this movie.

I can't love your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're so taller than Tom.
You can use his library.
I greeted him with a son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Fom's out of the door.

Did you tell Tom?
I am!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your dad think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did it all.
I don't want to listen to your theories.

It's been ten hours.
White bread, please.
I love you.
Tom's not grammatical.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We treat each other perfectly.
French complex, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before we get there.
He must've hit her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far?
How long has it been in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what they told us to do.
Fred Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll get it.
Last week I saw you and Tom.
Where did you get your shoes?
We're going to the beach.
Do you think this year will be snow on Christmas?
How was Tom's dinner?
I need a toilet.
I stayed in one of my pal's friends.
I'll work for you when you pay me the same good.
I'd like to have a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth since.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to pay me.
She's stuck.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom appreciates Mary's hair.
Tom didn't make me happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom is regularly dry with his mother.
We forgot to record!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I didn't stop at all.
She's the only one I know.
Mary's already taken her to the room?
I'll forgive him this time.
I like Chinese drinks.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a traitor.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
That's the count.
He's obviously disappointed me.
Tom won't win any more.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in in induction plates for direct heating.
I was scared.
Tom wants to learn how to play a drum.
Get out of here now.
Can I look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 songs with you for the exchange of prayers on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia as well.
I didn't know exactly what to start with.
That's what I remember!
Only love can break your heart.
I got two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's drunk.
He produced several letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pool?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to hang out behind the garden.
A cup of tea weighs about a hundred grams.
I had to leave a note to him.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half a third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Anyone else noticed this?
This proposal is not in English.
I'll take care of it, Tom.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are the same.
The infection got in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll say thank you sometimes.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I'm still taking a bad look.
Get out of here, you bastard!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I just slept two hours later.
Mary did not give in to despair.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought it would be.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say it's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Judge at all, she's healthy.
Tom's been in the stairwell.
Look at your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you already done it?
I love a hot drink.
How often do you get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change this?
Spain adopted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never gave up on you.
We used to do this together.
My house's not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no winners.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom's gonna be able to draw.
They're packed.
I didn't know what it would be impossible to do.
You're having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't understand Tom.
Did you kill her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary were almost one year old.
I was impressed.
I'm not going to give you advice.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom took Mary to breakfast.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wants to go to a zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll take it to the top of the mountain.
We're both familiar with her.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the old gloves.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Tom saw it?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it was to say.
His eyes were wide open, and his face was usually healed and covered with Romanians.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Here you go.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were lifted from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do this carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom's still living in Boston.
Let me take your bag.
Besides, I can't dance.
I don't expect to see you when I see you.
Why are you in my boots?
Power in Tom's hands.
I learned to deal and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not working at all right now.
Children enjoy playing more than learning.
He was taken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
They all tell me I look like my father.
Remember what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boy's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of thing.
Bring your wife.
Everything that's been in the mode right now?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're angry.
Our grandson was born last night.
On Tom's suit of pirates.
That's the pure truth!
They went for a walk.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
It must be here in 15 minutes.
I hope Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We're proud of our achievements.
That's why I had to invite Mary.
Tom had to order.
Do you love me?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I'll be there every day.
She became a postalian.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop being a cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this person is the one he's been after?
King Harold Hormsson, known as Harold Sinezubey, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He's been warned.
That's where Tom could stay longer.
Almost everything was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days have been very hot.
He's got a black coat.
I forgot to pick up the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Then Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom's very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom picked up Mary?
Tom likes to read German Hess.
I'm speaking the truth. I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal proceedings were brought before the court, it was generally accepted that there were twelve persons in the court.
What was Tom doing in Australia's mission?
Tom and I started seeing each other.
The boys marched around four in a row.
Tom was very disappointed.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do this.
There's another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got camera tastes all over me.
Tom, hurry up, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing drums.
You from Tokyo?
I want her not in my house.
You're probably not gonna be able to do this.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's world famous for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a very expensive present.
Do you have any idea?
Do you like these spirits?
Locked down.
Almaz is a precious stone.
Get dressed, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stop it, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to take us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want better.
Tom works as an officer.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many suffer from low self - esteem?
Was that too simple?
What Ellis faced, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war, it was a playful sound, so hard to break her drums, and so loud to reach heaven.
I lost him in the dust.
We talked about Jim when he came into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So I can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
Every year, many books are published.
Tom suddenly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My steel car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We've got to get him.
I tried hard to solve the problem.
You should've done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As soon as he wakes up, he wakes up.
We took the cannon.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Is Tom not remarkable?
He's your teacher?
The rich sometimes look high on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his zone.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
The defense went into the wood.
The language I hear is very complicated.
Your kid can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's the youngest of me.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President shall be four years old.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can't you solve this?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would he do that?
In the building twenty floors.
If you don't come, I won't go either.
You're probably not in the course when Tom comes back?
I don't have Tom's photo.
Can you wait a while?
Are you going to give him something for Christmas?
She won't let him down.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm a Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this song.
If he had followed my advice then he would now be a rich man.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind has gone up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to hang out with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How many are you planning to stay home tonight?
Sudka's gone.
Are you feeling okay?
He's like an asshole.
I think you can stand up.
She knew she wasn't right.
It's so fucking cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to dinner.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom talked to me last night.
Tom's ready to protect himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but I picked up a girl with a pipe.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We must maintain the plan.
I'll tell him what you called.
Tom is very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready to go to hell.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I'm smiling at the monkey.
They're always sorry.
Tom has little luck.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of upset.
It's not bad for her.
I'd better stay.
That's why there's a glowing idea in my head.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom's late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to make sure everything's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect he has to go to Boston next week.
Don't go abroad.
Tom saw it in horror.
Tom's face has grown.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
You're afraid of your own dark.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
There's a new chair in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom's here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
I'm the one who got hurt.
Unfortunately, yesterday there was rain.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you scared of the cross?
How much do you want to go?
She had legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the same square root of two?
Tom ran ahead and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're going to get hurt.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom did it a lot.
I hope we don't do this anymore.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These are precious gems.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I'm done, it's time to open up.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also good for animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom included the fanric and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll eat as soon as the rain stops.
The photo came from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was a daughter.
Who won't wake them up?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Just wait and hear.
Why did you split up like that?
From milk you can make oil, cheese, and a lot more.
You don't have the authority to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.

Take yourself pretty.
You like Jaz?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an anonymous guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as they expected.
He insisted on the answer.

I know you want to see them.
We're on the right track.
You'll get everything if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I'm eating like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?
No one's hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snow lions doesn't feel guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she's saying.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom didn't want to leave.

She sucked his ass.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red leg.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been lying.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who's playing Tom with?
I need a light coat.
I've done my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's wrong.
You're not coming?
I reassembled his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
It's yours.
Tom found a job without a job.
This book in public access?
Please, can't you talk to the mob?
I'll tell him to get in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please contact me, not like Jacob Matthewwich.
She's not one anymore.

You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You don't have me.
Tell them we're going.
I'm like a guy who wants to marry?
I closed the door, but I didn't stop her.
Therefore, we should be careful not to kiss Mary in person.
Can we help them?
Thanks for calling.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'm in command!
People, we've been doing good all year.
I'm not sorry.
I know Tom won't get married.
I don't like her very much.
He doesn't.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20.
She thought I'd take her.
I'm living in Boston now.
Tom took his secret with him into the brain.
You really want to put your money in that bank?

I'm a married man.
He bought his son's camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.

It's a good sign.
Some are convinced that their guardian is protecting them.

You're gonna beat her up?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payments will be made depending on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

I decided I wouldn't stay.
I'm looking forward to you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I was thinking.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want success.
There are no exceptions.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home earlier today?
You wouldn't survive.
Tom didn't think Mary'd upset it.
There's a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your balls.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I'll remember you.
That's interesting news.

You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Is everything ready tomorrow?
We checked.
Let's see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.

How many are you coming in tomorrow?
An open bag.

As it happened here, it's impossible to know now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A lot of voices were invented.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you now.
He'll probably be here soon.

I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how different Iraq is from Iran.
That's why they told me not to do it.
Two days ago, I got my pardon.
I was expecting him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's get some coffee or something.
You got something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom--he'll tell you the same thing.
He saw that laptop himself and agreed to move his hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I was thinking about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You must protect yourself.
There's no conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I'm excited about your respect.

Don't let me do this again.
Almost your turn, Barar!
You're rude.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they're doing to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does this.
I don't want anyone.
Tom's gonna work on these exits.
Give her a call, please.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.

Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
It's time you got enough.
We should've been more careful.
You have to sleep.
I'm proud that my father is a good fighter.
You want to tell me something else?

No one's been paying attention to me.
So there were thirteen at that time.
I'm going to Boston on my bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay ahead.
You made coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Put yourself on a suit like that.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your leg?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he went about his business.
Why did he need Tom?
It's a capital investment.
It's really hot.
There's no time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the key?
She didn't even look at me.
You promise?
I know you've done this embarrassingly.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
A net!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
Thank you.
Until certain conditions are met.

What actually happened back in Boston?
What does it mean to learn?
These Persians are not very sweet.
I don't think these blacks can be taken out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay her.
I can't forgive his tears.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom got out of school.

They offered us their help.
Tom firmly decided to kiss Mashu.
You're very hungry?
What's going on with him?

You can't always win.
It's some kind of celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As they all know, he's genius.
Cartina's on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy's afraid of the darkness.
I've prepared a job for him.
Russia has become a second state.
I'm worried about them too.
He went to mail to send a letter.
Throw that shit into the water bottle.
Will you come with her?
Let's take one of those ready meals that are sold on the market.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go across the border?
Don't blame the government.
Put it in place.
How did you get to know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per room in Manhattan is about $4,000 per month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any cousins.
Let's see something else.
You think this is the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to.
That's why I'm doing something here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stay here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't touch the door.
You must take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom became suspicious that something was wrong.

It can be anyone.
One language is never enough.

That's not true.
There is a significant difference between them.

You have to tell him not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.

Come closer.
We stopped at Hilton.
That's why Mary has to tell the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.

All attention!
In the same second, I fell in love with that language.

Every community is dangerous, especially that.

Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom's thinking.
I knew it was something like this.
You're hiding something, aren't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account shall be paid to the first number of the next month.
My French coward.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was a victim of demand.
I can't talk about my colleague.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why don't I die?
Slowly it's over.
I didn't take it.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave an answer.
You didn't choose that man.
They risked their lives.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He was better before.
Tom wants to see us.

He's out of bed.
They're following the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that language cannot be spoken.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the Exams be here today?
What motivates you?
He himself gave Leele his computer.
Put your hand down.
I was hoping you'd be back.
You think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say that anyone in America can become president, but it's probably not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
First on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you leave?
Mary tried to calm down.
How much is a trip going on?
How much is this trip going to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John met each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I gave him a piece of paper.
It's the neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come here yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You can't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Please translate it into French.
Take the cold chair!
He needs a cab.
The crowd grew fast.
Mary told me she loved me.
That's what Tom told me about what happened.
Cut your hair and kill it.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers with Tom's answers.
Tom's weak heart.
That's why he'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you borrow me a carnivorous knife?
Tom took off his paycheck.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do this on your own.
No one saw how you took it.
I'll get half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally did it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was pregnant.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth month?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's going to a white boy's wedding dress.
It's a magazine.
I'll have to wait.
He was resurrected yesterday, not Saturday.
Anyone here with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom reminded me.
That's what we can do.
He knows his weaknesses.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary wears a black suit.
We ate at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many wide-ranging prospects in this city.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry the next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She doesn't force me.
You haven't told him yet?
She's got a double.
We can't force people to do this.
Let's get her.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't endure this color.
They're sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her go.
The neighbors were begging us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot the bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust him.
She's missing too.
I wonder why he needs it.
I think that's suspicious.
I'll make sure you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Do you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to be happy?
You're a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
The winter is about to end.
I don't mean any titles or prizes.
Where did you find him at all?
The meeting's over.
I'll meet you.
Have you had a good time out there?
Tom's five beer.
You don't want to do it. Don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need enough.
Bring him a drink.
What do you want to eat on these exits?
Get out of here!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She got tired of me.
He's afraid we're going crazy.
I can't call him home.

The boy ran away to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help him.
I'm joining you with her.
She's got the highest scores.
Tom may be upset.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have for your child?
I'm in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used his full home.
I'd like to take care of it.
Give me a note books or something like that.
I don't want to get out of the house tonight.
He'll be here today.
Cot's dead.
Now only half a ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have dinner with me today.

Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car's covered with a deep hole.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom discovered Mary's door open.
Laurie home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make this mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to get married.
I've been waiting all my life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he run an exam?
The plane came into the trunk.
It wasn't him.
Do you have a friend on record in Indonesia?
You might want to help her.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play with you in chess.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be pleased to meet you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your zones?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom.
Where are you?
I didn't hear death yesterday.
I've got everything.
She didn't have food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of vehicles passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
In the attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: they'll ever transfer it.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
They all loved you.
We're family souls with him.
I have a grandson of your age.
I'm sorry I took your dinner.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She's starting to get into her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
Now a couple of early drinking drinks, right?
My parents don't like my dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit his tail and he's strong.
Why, worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I get you a hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the sound.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about your destiny.
The series needs to start to see when all seasons are gone!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where did you go to bed?
You were in Paris?
It's a very impressive prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a scarf hand.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a photo together.
I lost my exam.
They all knew about it.
You better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
They're coming too?
She's sleeping like a young man.
Tom forgot to let the brakes go.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
You're gonna blow up the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they woke up.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children already?
Tom didn't want to get involved.
They like him.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is an idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let's get out of here.
I know you're all crazy.
Tom thinks it's a sin to take out the products.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is lost right away.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved.
Let's go to church.
Tom Potato whiskey.
Was it heavy?
He's responding.
I haven't met him before.
How much did he stand?
I need to see you immediately.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The fish is caught in a net.
I'm the same as I used to be.
You know the guy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
A thief steals a thief and a thief.
Because Tom's not going very well?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went to the fishing.
He was just a shadow of the past.
How do we do this?
I can't believe Tom actually doesn't want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them go.
Everyone's here.
What day is it?
Let's give him another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a normal guy.
Wake me up before you ask.
Is that true?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day he died.
Tom and I should stay together.
I just heard about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
Don't compare yourself with us.
I saw the car coming up.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never choose my Pleistheshn.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay calm!
What kind of loving telegram do you have?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
The next day, Tom's gone.
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for me, your son.
Her father seems to be a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to go home today.
You need them.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to worry about him.
The officer mustered up courage in his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm just thinking about trying something like that right now.
I don't understand very much.
I'm going to prepare a meat house on the floor first.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many zones do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom soon became very famous.
All this has been known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay for it.
Mom, look what I found.
It's interesting what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said so.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw how he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
It must be home.
She was the one I thought about.
Tom showed his driving rights to the police.
I meet every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to let them go.
It's apple acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go to the fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
You're gonna get a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus burned the holy fire to the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before it got burned.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than me.
In our town there are many talented people, but Tom doesn't care about them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're getting checks.
My bike's gone.

We've seen it before.
How much did you buy?
We never give up hope.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
Even if I'm not talking about the price, it won't pay me.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think I'd be punished.
Write it down.
We didn't build it.
You better go help him.
That's right?
Tomorrow morning they're selling tickets to the Shakiri concert.
It was better today.
I know Tom's a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not funny.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to go.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
No one's seen that.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
They all love money.
They went astray in the woods.
When were you last time?
I have a heart attack.
My father won't let me in one movie.
I saw it like a boat tonette.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll support you.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbor?
My father will watch TV after school.
He's drinking wine.
Please clear up your apple pie, I've prepared it for you.
I mean, Tom didn't understand the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it in time if you get out now.
There were no special problems with Tom.
The dark didn't hide it.
I invited him to work.
I'm sure finding a place will be easy.
I took two tablets of aspirin from the headache.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last copy.
Don't laugh!
Love won't blame anyone.
If you come to him now, you'll probably stop watching his TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't want to try them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made a selfie without a doll.
In which kingdom was this church built?
Soon we can put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back anymore.
I'm sure Tom would love to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
So I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater falls on this tube.
I've always considered Tom a close friend.
I'm one of the girls who spend more time with guys.
Don't worry, I've got insurance.
Tom's gonna be here with me.
It's hard for my father to drink.
No one's offering you to take care of this.
He's been working in this company since Monday after his resurrection.
Mary forgot to turn on the car.
I'm old.
Tom went with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call him tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who's he for nationality?
He was sitting with John in one room.
I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In our time men are harder to be... themselves.
I'll never talk to him again.
Sh-sh, Tom, wake up!
I'm keeping my burden payments.
I did what I promised them to do.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She came out of her house and cried at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The hunters are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
You like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
You wanted to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still in love.
You'll be better tomorrow.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of a banana?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I get it.
Tom spoke Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my mind.
Toma's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously smart.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to dinner.
Her hair is wet from the pot.
I'm just buying a soft toilet book.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom lives on the field between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it takes?
The boat driver is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary?
All the stairs in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got everything to do.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in a room with a brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna start it all, right?
I can't breathe.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
In 1857, the Dinamite defeated Alfred Nobel.
We have to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my eyes.
I've already talked to that student.
What is the chemical symbol of Bromisto-dwelling acid?
We got a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the same shade.
I asked Tom.
That's why you need to talk to your lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Clyvo!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a courtman.
I respect his views, even though I don't agree with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She connected his sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the ground.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't benefit them?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
You're planning on staying for a long time?
We ate quickly and left at the same time.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're right.
Careful, don't throw anything at your feet.
Start every meal with a soup.
I'm afraid I'm alone.
What did she get you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him at all?
He didn't stop the car.
He lived directly against me.
The door was open.
I brought wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Big apples.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's coming?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom was interested.
I think they're happy.
You understand Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're kidding me.
She was wondering what his loss would be like.
A good trainer trains this command.
The tree's sick.
The trip was delayed because of a severe snowstorm.
Why don't you give it to them?
What do you think I don't want to go with?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you have done?
Don't you know her?
I didn't ask Tom whether he's planning to do this or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was cold, he didn't go out on the street.
On the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephant is made of the elephant bone.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native French.
It's a good thumb.
She stopped falling.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Impartiality is his only positive quality.
My hobbies are the collection of dirty people.
The boy Tom lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went further.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she has a nice beauty.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, young people are buried under the trees.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you just listened.
What should I have done in that situation?
I'm sorry he broke you up.
He who has never left the borders of his country has committed adultery.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping women.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd be back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I included an idea.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was against me being alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get you that way.
You know what you're doing, right?
I can't trust machine translation.
She hit me, not him.
You don't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing more than a miracle.
We're related to her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
He's released.
What, they said, what happened?
Can't you leave the door open?
You'll have to wait for it.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's both older than me.
Tom knows what they did was wrong.
A mild climate in Japan.
Check it again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the wounded game.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
Our trip was very hungry.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France once, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped. You can reopen the window.
I've never been with that before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when I called.
I don't have to bear it.
Always get in the way of moving things.
We're being asked to present ourselves.
I would like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's good, but I don't like her.
I can get you fired if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have this problem?
I never asked her.
Nothing gets weaker like a hot tub.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You don't have to regret it.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice is like a musical song of siren to me.
How's your marriage?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why she didn't like Mary.
My fingers were left on the glass of printing.
Chemistry is a remarkable science.
I feel that my French is not going to be much better.
How can I get my passport?
Maybe you're in a position to help him.
Tom is the best waitress I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Let's get another light.
I gave my sister a word.
It's my father's car, but she'll soon be mine.
You forgot what his name is?
If I had time to do it, I would.
You see Tom's boat?
A big fam?
This medicine will help you.
Stop smiling.
I've got a life that hurts.
You know how I was employed?
Tom agreed to do it.
I trust someone.
She's a "Sex in a Big City".
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Get in touch with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this often?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here's a few interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's breathe here.
Are you in the new boots?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you wanted?
That's what my mom said.
She cut off the grass when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Cooking is strictly forbidden.
That Persian is beautiful.
You see?
Tom's not in the mood for this.
You shouldn't have been in such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here's a few letters for you.
This is virtually impossible for a scientist at such a level to make such an elemental mistake.
He has no evidence.
You look bad.
He was very good when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I've filled the kitchen with confidence.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house are you living in?
I told them it wasn't nice.
Why do we live?
Will there be rain today?
We know about her.
You could help us.
I'm driving a car a lot.
That's why I don't like the end of the movie.
Just walk inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I like endings.
It's in the library.
So you were at school?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sleep with us?
You're good enough?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting to the next resurrection.
She thinks it can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's family.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like Carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
Who did Tom sell his car?
Tom's smiling.
I need to earn money so I can buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
That's why Mary and I need to rest.
He was sleeping.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's key is.
What book are you looking for?
I'll sleep a little.
You'll fall there sometime.
Tom's good with Mary.
- "You owe me money." - "No, you don't."
He came and stood on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did it for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom works three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to preparation, no one's like Mary.
You haven't been yourself lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked the shark.
I'll drink it for you.
We'll do it as time goes on.
I'll be three times older next year.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your brand collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's pretty much above Mary.
He looks like nobody knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This guy's gonna stick to your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up a professional guitar game.
Now I'm married.
It was all a couple of times.
This time you went too far.
It's working.
Are you going to meet Tom before he leaves?
It's nothing weird, Tom answered.
We want to take the apartment out of town.
They spoke French.
It's so expensive.
He's not coming anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't been gone yet.
Tom for a couple of games above Mary.
I'm glad you offered it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is the world’s language.
It sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for work.
Why does he need a baby?
I'm afraid of darkness.
The situation is getting worse.
I'm going to choose where to taste.
Tom decided to buy a maintenance car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She broke up.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give it to him.
Get out of here. That's what they're arresting you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom set himself up to meditate every morning.
You checked your accounts?
He tried to build a short story.
The stone without a book, like the body without a soul.
Why did God try us so hard?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I met Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make impressions.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle thought the Earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
No one understands me.
There's so many stars in heaven, I can't count them.
They all came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in Arctic.
I told you I'd be the best.
I told you Tom wants to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do something a few times.
So today let the possession of the property be destroyed by the man who was to be cast into the fish's belly.
I'm so unarmed!
I'd never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's running out of Russian -- at least he told me that.
Tom is a third coach.
How long will you stay?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a great father.
The trip was overdue.
The house's beautiful.
I think I'm starting with beer bottles.
You know Boston pretty well?
Orchestra started to play.
Mary was dressed in a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a bully.
He was born on June 5, 1970, at seven o'clock.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are neighbors.
Tom's just a white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We have three rules.
She bought one of her own.
The security didn't see Tom.
Tom's been busy lately.
I helped transport those bags.
They've got full time.
Fifty-five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are up.
I've always been a woman.
Finally, she did it.
That's an inferno that they weren't spared from the fire.
We've got a dog money.
The examan was split into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, you guys are so cute here!
Reading the book is like traveling.
Tom saw Mary enter the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would soon win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't like Boston so much.
She keeps writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I don't bring disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said upset everyone.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She showed her talents.
I'd like that to be possible.
I guess you can't do this.
I thought I was alive.
Bob will play his first role at the next school.
You must remain in shape.
All day long, I've been lying about the seeds.
By the way, I realized that he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Be merciful!
Tom's down.
All people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
Are you gonna be able to fall on your back?
The Duke has many lands.
Well, they're just having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel like a home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
If it doesn't sell goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom improved the money.
Why didn't you go to your room?
If God doesn't, it's all allowed.
Our name is Mary.
I knew I had to get married for him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please set up rocks at the time of harvest and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like sea products.
I've waited a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
You built all this yourself?
I'm looking forward to summer vacation with great patience.
Can you make this a different one?
From here on he's looking at it.
Wooded homes are easily depleted.
Let's get Tom's dinner.
You're still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you swore.
Blood is very comfortable.
I'll report it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's stuck.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for his coming here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's booby.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
It's all ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a naughty guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the suit.
What bird can't fly?
That's what we need to do.
Tom didn't answer it right away.
Tom died in 70 years.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks French.
The invention of the transistor was a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexie?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on on the 10th floor?
I hate spinach.
Mother's preparing dinner.
Tom is a palmist.
What can I do?
Her son Gianni.
I know you saw terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give up emotion.
We had to learn about his death.
Why didn't they leave?
I didn't see you.
You're just going to find out.
He had cancer.
You're responsible for what happened.
It's just like time.
I know where you're going.
You understand everything on the flight.
Let's blame him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do it.
I don't like it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's on the writing table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not making any more noise.
Tom was a drunk smoker.
Tom's got some glasses.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this kind of thing.
I'm wondering who's gonna help him get a snowball?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family life?
What's that noise?
My son has hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He left the glass.
I don't know if there's a light country where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is the attack.
She's getting married this summer.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easier.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
What's life like?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
Why did you decide you couldn't?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for correcting me.
With your mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted evidence.
Tom cleans his heart.
Tom can't get on the bike.
I'm not talking about the body at all.
Why did Tom get away with it?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at the tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to eat at home.
Where it's convenient.
They didn't make it for a while.
Now seven and thirty.
I see, you've got it.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs have been dead for a long time.
I usually climb through one step.
Tom got out that year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
What about you from Boston?
Put it on my desk.
Tom was taken from the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
You know Tom's brother?
All herbs can take off the eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
Today I've got everything on my hands.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom's only 30 learned to drive.
I'm glad he didn't suffer.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed so long.
The kitchen knife was not hard enough to cut meat, so I used my perforated knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon adapt to a wooden life.
Keep some water safe.
You're no longer a child.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all on board.
This is where the river's deep.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I'm sure you should tell him.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed each other.
The writing of individual words in cases where they must be written is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the rest of the finished painting?
She died ten years ago.
Tom met Mary last year.
You need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary were studying at the university.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
A woman who doesn't wash — you don't wash your feet.
I'll take you to six.
I teach Tom French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary's got eyes on her.
I'd like to know how long Tom's planning to go to Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do this?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom's gone.
He's selling cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"You think he'll come?" "I hope he doesn't."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I've been shopping for years.
They shot at me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave Mary a rose.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They took the bus first.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anybody know them here?
This must be a mistake.
He can't let himself take his leave.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship is still strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom's sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes prayer will be twice in one place.
I don't get tired.
Leave me alone.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Make it up to me.
You were surprised?
We counted the annual keys on the tree that we cut down and determined that it was thirty years old.
I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
The queens are multiplying quickly.
I don't want to discuss it now.
How much do you need a clean coat?
We're beautiful.
Open your ear.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness comes to your door.
You need to listen to her.
I want you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me plainly.
I'll come in whatever happens.
Don't you dare make another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom's gone last.
Tom signed an apology.
Did you try to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She was acting out of her innocence.
We don't know so much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me some time.
Do you want them to help?
Tom's not visible anywhere.
That's what I told him to come here.
Find out what they said.
The apples are the best fruits.
You couldn't close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
In the near future, we can meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a hero.
I fell asleep alive.
Keep me in the course.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she was buying it.
I've prepared breakfast.
I'd like to buy two marks for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bicycle on your birthday.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
The beer is beer.
I don't think that's why I like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You kind of said she was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
It's extremely interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Do they all have fun?
Tom's watching the figure on TV.
We're going to have to sleep on the street today.
That's what Tom showed Mary how this is going on?
Incredible, isn't it?
I cut the rose.
The school's gone in five minutes.
Tom put a bed in his arm.
Is that the only thing that's going to bother you?
Do you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide the tears.
Self - confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you a reference.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
How many others know about this?
I'm excited.
We didn't meet in Paris.
Are there volunteers?
I told her she wasn't interested.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
People often complain about the weather.
I just need you to sign it.
I felt something wrong.
Tom stole a beer.
I'll tell you what to do.
A man born in France is French.
I'm not used to it.
It's a gift from her.
Do you have a home?
Don't feed the liquid.
Hey, it's me.
Now tell me something about yourself.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom is teaching my children French.
Tom says he didn't spend three days.
It doesn't look like Tom's gonna be happy.
There's some bugs here.
I had to tell him to go there.
We're gonna finish it.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick gave me a picture.
You said you'd help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't see her face.
It could come up.
Someone sent us a present.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, right?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked me for advice.
Tom started crying.
Hope for her ass.
He would never gather me.
She wasn't sick.
I tried to be nice.
He's deliberately gone away so he won't kill me.
You think I'd change my mind?
Tom is a citizen of Australia.
You bought them?
Tom just looked at Mary and fell asleep.
I gave them my old coat.
Tom came to help Mary.
Did you release or a conservator?
We don't know exactly why this happens.
The presence is mandatory.
He himself got away from Leila's camera.
There was rain on Monday in Boston.
I just don't agree with you.
The new president can be set up, can't he?
I'd like some coffee if you do it.
I'll tell you something about it.
How many do you want?
They say Venice is a beautiful city.
You should talk to Tom.
It's a Chinese name.
In the end, she didn't call.
The doctor had to wait a long time: he was on surgery.
What's really bothering you?
It all changed during the twentieth century.
Please do it.
Tom is a risk driver.
Tom's got a lot of familiar, but very few friends.
I went to the museum for days.
I haven't met a more comfortable and detailed grammar guide yet.
How do you know him?
I'd like to talk to the test.
At first, I didn't like him, but now I like him.
I lost my money.
I'm on a ten-hour trip.
I can't dedicate you to my plan.
I broke her.
That's what you said?
Tom and Mary know each other very well.
You bought a long coat.
Scientists explain this differently.
What are you doing here?
Do Germans have other concerns in life than consumerism?
Does she have a brother or a sister?
Hey, what are you doing?
They're selling shoes.
The card is very nice.
Why?
It's my favorite project.
We don't have water.
Don't you want to introduce yourself?
Don't worry, even if I drink it doesn't affect how I drive the car.
Tom told me he'd stay home.
I lived in a three-room apartment when I was in Boston.
Don't look at that.
Our school has a bus stop.
That's exactly more than thirty.
Tom's got a ring.
"Oh, I die," said Peter, falling on my knees.
After I was on my way, I noticed that the bookstore was gone.
How long does Tom die?
Are you playing guitar?
We hope we don't have to do this.
We're under control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
It's obviously inevitable.
It's your fault, not mine.
I wanted everything.
We'll do it tomorrow.
Shut up, you're too much pain.
Don't trust him.
What search system are you using?
I swore I'd never do anything like that to anyone.
Tom's got a dark past.
Tom and Mary used to be friends.
I was afraid I could find out.
Are you an actor or a singer?
I like being here.
Tom noticed that the door was not closed.
Tom was sleeping with lamants.
There's only standing places.
I know Tom is a good teacher.
How cruel of you!
You kind of said you wanted me to do it.
Dan realized they were in love with Linda.
I saw Mary coming out of the house.
You couldn't get out of the room?
Tom needed some explanations.
He's my wife's friend, not mine.
Tom told me he didn't want to move to Australia.
Tom promised he wouldn't cry.
I told him everything we did yesterday.
I'm so glad.
I need to kiss the baby's chest.
Drinking is a food suitable for today’s life.
Do you know where the dog is?
Tom said he didn't care about Mary.
Why am I always?
I'd be surprised if Tom had won.
We don't know English at all.
I couldn't do anything for Tom.
I don't think I'd do that.
The door doesn't want to close.
I thought Tom hated Mary.
I'm a Japanese student.
You don't have to.
Well, I think it's time to tell this story.
I haven't been drinking for years.
Tom doesn't see Mary anymore.
Tom gave me this galley.
Why would he think of his age?
Come on in the third, please.
I feel like you don't really want me to win.
I know you're not even eighteen yet.
I went to the lawn store yesterday.
We found out he was innocent.
Tom the only one didn't know that Mary moved to Boston.
They live with you?
Don't write beautiful blacks.
Tom shouldn't have called me.
I don't want to see you.
Keep your hands on the wheel.
He'll play tennis tomorrow.
I saw your rights.
I didn't give up hope.
I'm quiet.
And it went on until early in the morning.
I've got a very nice schedule.
That's his answer to my letter.
People without a sense of humor are like a wolf without a flower.
The photo showed the location on the map.
I usually play dogs in the second half of the day.
I never wanted to try Tom.
Tom called to tell me what's going on.
I told him I was thinking.
The second is said to be the first.
You think I'm pregnant?
They probably don't know about it.
Tom and Mary are in bad company.
I thought you were asleep.
We have a little surprise for you.
He is proud of his children.
He's an El Sandwich with a bus.
Tom said Mary's crying.
Tom got tired of Mary, but she didn't answer his hug.
You don't know Tom's brother?
I don't have time for politics.
It was a strange story.
Where'd you get our address?
Tom's gonna stay home.
There's going to be a heavy rain.
Is that a name?
Tom's up.
Why can't I go to dinner?
I like that more.
I can hear it.
Drop your weapons!
Emily asked me a question.
I wanted to tell you that.
Stores work on Monday.
It may not be as difficult as you think.
Shakespeare, whose poems are known all over the world, lived about four hundred years ago.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Tom told me he was cold.
I don't blame you in any way.
Tom saw everything that happened.
How did you come to that conclusion?
Who do you know in Boston?
I'm happy because we won't be in school today until September.
I think you'll get me some help.
Hi, I'm Sepide.
I heard Tom more.
I'm sorry you didn't come with us.
Tom set me up.
We can't do that anymore.
People look like walls.
I have a better plan.
Half the world's population lives in cities.
I was so careful.
I've never seen them before.
We have a good school library.
I thought Tom--your husband.
I know you kissed Tom.
I like to play alone.
Tom didn't want to be recognized in his own innocence.
I tried to protect you.
She wanted to meet you.
You're the only Canadian I know.
I am too determined to focus on this issue right now.
I wanted to tell him something, but he didn't.
That's a problem to remember.
I'm talking about the ring.
Can I start?
It's bad for them.
She's too weak.
You can't be here.
Tomoko just didn't cry.
The main secret of ideas is where they come from, because it is impossible to catch the thought until it comes into my head, so I accept my own ideas as a gift which I have been happy to use.
Ubuntu has a lot of software.
He said I should go.
Tell him what happened?
Tom slept?
There's a big difference between the theory and the idea.
I know you can't stop them.
She likes to take a bath with a shower.
He's her teacher.
He's at his desk.
Put him on the table.
I need to go right now?
I'm in all the ports today.
We're drinking grape juice.
I want to talk to you about Tom.
The wall must be built within six months.
Tom thought you were working.
I've had an unpleasant smell on my chest.
I'll find a way to do this.
The probability of this happening is minimal.
We decided to take her to work.
Her skin is snowing.
Tom had to go back to half the third.
I'm a clone in a dream.
I saw Tom do it.
I'm not gonna be alone.
You have to do it now.
Tom would never do what you blamed him for.
Tom wasn't the only one who was late.
Let me get you something to drink.
Is it true that you like salt coffee?
I never thought Tom would want to do that.
Once you've made a promise, you've got to keep it.
I hope you don't try.
Children are forbidden to smoke.
You're starting now.
Father's there.
It's so bad for me!
I don't want you to get upset.
I couldn't deny it.
Why are you markings?
I heard this song before.
It's all serious.
I hate football.
They're not going to talk about it.
I studied the structure of the alien families.
A car with wings or you're gonna die!
You did something wrong.
Nothing more important than a friend.
Tom's always kidding.
What were we doing?
I love classical music.
I like to hear him.
I can't play an electrician.
You could ask her.
Look under your feet.
I'm surprised Tom's not here.
Do you like the movie?
I didn't ask her.
Who did it?
You had to leave me alone.
You don't mind if I look at you?
We need this woman's name.
As a result, Mary’s new pay was enjoyed.
I don't care.
You're three inches above me.
Tom advised me to do this.
I love Mindal, and I don't like Arhis.
I'm following this on myself.
Did you know you had a door open?
Are you going to tell him that?
Tom told me he couldn't remember what happened.
Just give us everything.
She said she was trying.
She's got a nice door.
They're getting better in prison.
Tom's not too smart.
She still loved him.
Even kids would understand that.
I'm a little tired.
Her story brought me back as a child.
I want you to know that Tom and I are all right.
Tell her to be here for half a third.
They were scared and killed Tom.
It's your apple.
Tom doesn't fully understand Mary.
She likes to watch TV.
In the movie theater, fire began immediately.
I came right back.
Tom missed the cat.
Why don't you find him?
He didn't like her way of explaining it.
My idea was much better.
I don't know when prices change.
Mary is one of the most beautiful women I've ever met.
I'm going to a school with Tom.
The operation lasted six hours.
You're free now?
I got it.
Tom made his girlfriend's offer, and she said yes.
Is that your teacher or mine?
Can you turn on the light?
I think I need some help.
They protected the weak.
I don't like it when my stuff comes out.
Do we have olive oil?
Don't let him be Mary.
I have two sisters and a brother.
Take us there, Tom.
They decided to marry.
Swimming with dolphins is dangerous.
I really hope Tom doesn't win.
I was very angry when Tom died.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
What's the wine?
Why are you home?
I'd like to help you.
Hey, wait a minute.
If Tom asked me for help, I'd help him.
You can take everything you like.
Tom was crying.
Are you talking about Tom or yourself?
How did you get here?
You betrayed him!
I don't think someone else noticed what Tom's doing.
I'd like to be in Boston on Friday.
I think Tom deserves it.
Tom made a picture.
I've got a lot of money.
I'd better wake them up.
Mary said she saw Tom yesterday.
We'll be ready for your visit.
Tom went to Australia.
I love Vanilla ice cream.
I don't know how to translate the word "oindre".
At least you could say thank you.
She was a little girl then.
Everything was just wounded because she was 48 years old.
Space therapy for urban cells is at an early stage of development.
I can't take it from you.
I've been in America two times.
You can go home.
Tom's not the only one who wants to win.
Mary has flowers in her hair.
Let's not be about this.
It's not heavy, it's easy.
I'll do my job tomorrow.
Why did he stop hugging me?
Tell him Mary wants to see him.
He has exceeded his authority.
Can we speak French instead?
I broke his nose.
Don't listen to him.
I gotta go.
Cut off the meat with the knife.
I know what they look like.
Mary likes to put a bullet in her eye.
Mary wanted to be a girl to Tom.
Keep practicing.
There's going to be a problem.
I opened the door.
Have you been with Tom all the time?
Tom was proud of you.
He's already gone for lunch.
Some people don't like it.
Tell them what you need.
That beautiful girl in the kitchen — Tom’s sister.
What do you know about me?
Tom did everything he could to keep Mary from becoming president of the student council.
Find some good friends and keep them.
Tomorrow he'll play with the champion in heavy weight.
It's very simple.
So they said he was too low.
I always wanted to learn how to prepare like you.
This morning I got up late.
I don't think he still needs help.
What happened?
If we start early, we can finish dinner.
I was almost sure Tom wasn't doing it.
I have some money.
Unfortunately, many Russians have inadequate representations of what is happening in Kiev.
Call me when you get back.
I saw her.
It's hard to do?
She said she was Mary.
I'm leaving Boston.
- "Keep it like that." - "Yes?" - "No, no."
Why do you pay me?
She was begging for the post office.
I'd better go earlier today.
I don't want anything right now.

You've got a nice dress.
It's an electrode.
I knew Tom would refuse to do this.
The Court rejected the outcome.
He did as he told him.
He saw the star today.
No one believes in visions in our day.
I need something to talk to you about.
My time's working wrong.
Tell him to do the same.
If we don't finish this job, we'll lose the next contract.
The drunk man couldn't go straight.
Mary's not my daughter.
The other one is a big store.
We must be ready for this.
I don't know why Tom didn't win.
That black bag of yours?
You're strangers.
There's an old church in this town.
Mary's mad at you, isn't she?
What exchange rate?
Tom was really dressed.
I'm a democracy.
He watched her drive on his car until she turned only to the next point.
He went there with her.
You should've kept it secret.

You have to close the door.
I told him to get into his room.
The city's been killed.
Is there any news?
Where's Jim?

I can't explain what I don't understand.
My sister's not learning now.
I know a man who masters Russian.
You live here alone?
Whatever happened, it's gone.
I forgot.
Would you rather not do anything?
Tom returned Mary's key.
They attend every meeting.
Get the brakes.
How many planes do you have?
Tom tried not to panic.
You can add bullets.
There was a great earthquake in India yesterday.
I won't wait forever.
I think it's time to start.
We found it this morning.
He didn't forget her.
Unfortunately, this book is all sold.
I didn't know you'd be here.
My grandson's screaming very loud.
Tom has made a list of places he would like to visit.
I'm unsecured.
The new tunnel will connect England and France.
Why aren't you with him?
Dan brought Linda into his room.
She forgave him for killing her father.
He hurt himself when he fell.
It'll be all day long.
I was just talking to your doctor.
I'd drink beer.
Where did you park the car?

I'll be home to half a third.
Can I trust her?

I need a toilet.
Stay, please!
American football for slots, these men are playing in the regby.
Do you have a hand?
The persidian cat slept under the table.
I gave him my card.
I didn't know you were so unhappy.
You don't know what Tom's capable of.
Try not to go wrong again.
What are you talking about?
It's hot here.
Just give me your order.
I told you we're late.
He couldn't remember my address.
To try Mary can be everyone, not everyone can.
Have I ever told you what you look like?
The police arrested her.
Tom moved here three months ago.
I feel weird today and I don't understand why.
He's crying because he's hungry now.
I don't know how it happened, but obviously it was so judged.
He's working on his English.
I'm spending better than I'm gonna watch the movie.
I did it myself.
Maybe I should talk to them.
I'm not going to talk to him.
In 1961, Nikolai Hrapov received seven years of camps for the writing of the Psalm entitled “Grant You Christ’s Colorful Nation,” which came to be followed by the famous Russian Baptist youth.
I thought Boston wouldn't like you.
Let her call them.
That's why I can't be there.
I don't know where my phone comes from.
He went to the store.
I asked Tom why.
I invited the neighbor to breakfast.
They've been working a lot.
Is there any view?
Life's interesting.
"If you let me, Grandma, I'd like to ask you three questions."
Tom won't be happy here.
You don't have a heart.
How long have you been missing?
I'm here to talk to you.
I'll be at the kitchen.
Mary took off her sunglasses.
I'd like to see Tom.
They're gone.
Tom just wanted to talk.
Are you buying it?
We don't know where we want to go.
There were no chairs in the room.
We took out the apartment.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
This option cannot be deleted.
Put them in the corner.
Bob didn't make the last trip, and he had to get a cab.
She likes it.
The teacher sees you.
Your parents didn't come, did they?
He met Tom along the way.
What's their plan?
Tom, single and abandoned, standing on the left side of the proposal, could not have decided to move down to finish all this story.
Did Tom really help you?
Dutch is a close relative of German.
How's the factory doing now?
Didn't you just call Tom?
I thought Tom didn't have a car.
Prostitution, gambling, drug use, drinking, violation of the established order and all other illegal activities of the STROG.
Tom didn't comment on it.
Don't you mind if I write this conversation?
What's your name?
The sun has gone down.
I'll see you in two weeks.
Then I'll get it.
I'm glad you accepted my offer.
Can I help you?
Well, it's a dragonfly!
That's where I was born.
I just need Tom's help.
Moscow is a Russian city.
Don't cross the road into the red light.

You have to win today.
I thought Tom was a woman.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
It's yours.
Jim's above all his friends.
Everything except you were laughing.
Do you have a favorite restaurant in Boston?
I guess I'll get used to it for a while.
You've got to make an order before.
Are you watching the game?
Tom's got a big penis.
What you're saying is more important than what you're saying.
The victory was achieved through Tom’s strategic experience.
I'll get him inside.
I'm sorry.
The doors have been left open.
I have terrible pain.
He's committed to her.
You've lost everything.
Tom's got a lot of excitement.
Where are you today?
We're talking about your work.
Here's my ticket.
You kind of said you liked Tom.
Tom sat on the stairs and smoked a cigarette.
Tom's probably going to be sentenced to death.
It's interesting that this is it.
I don't even know how old I am.
Tom was late for work.
Tom began to lose patience.
We haven't been late for the trip.
Looks like something's gonna happen soon.
Look at something.
"You're natural or gay?" "I'm natural."
I'll go if you don't go.

The meeting lasted an hour.
Tom got too tired to work.
Tell them I'm coming back.
He buys and sells leather products.
Tom left me a surprise.
The sharks may even feel a small amount of blood in the water.

Get this hole in the water.
Arenda's here on his way.
Tom and Mary are still young.
Tom's coming in.
Don't forget!
I can't stand face to face.
We must probably tell him what happened.
All your goldfish are dead.
Tom has a very stressful job.
I knew Tom would like to drink.
We have to go.
I didn't know you could do that.
Do you have any visions?
Tom went to the fishing.
Take mine.
It's a temporary condition.
Clean your teeth.
I want them to pay me today.
Tom opened his window.
Tom's been attacked.
Mary received a Nobel Prize.
All I have left is to drink vodka and forget to sleep.
Two plus two will be four.
