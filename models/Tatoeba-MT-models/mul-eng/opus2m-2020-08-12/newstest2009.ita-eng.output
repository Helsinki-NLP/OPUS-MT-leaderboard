The Borsa di Prague at the end of the market had a negative impact.
After the storm of the morning, the Borsa di Prague recovered the losses.
The CEZ operations have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Borsa di Prague recovered from the day before it was almost 6%.
Back to this peak there's the action hall at Wall Street.
Thus, we too have a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the local financial sector stabilisation plan.
Croll of Action in Asia
On Tuesday the actions of the Asian Borse have lived a dramatic horror, although the figures, however, have subsequently cancelled part of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong Borsa index has canceled almost 4% during the day, but then a part of the losses has been stabilized by 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the move of Chinese actions to Hong Kong Borsa, has decreased by 3.8% while in Shanghai markets have been closed.
The actions at Sydney's Borsa were more than 5% lost, but at the end of the losses, the losses were estimated at 4.3%.
Thay-Wan's Borsa, according to the local index, decreased by 3.6%.
"The planning of rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, manages its financial policy alone, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries also have consequences.
The United States of America's Action Strategy
The US Parliament rejected the support plan for the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars had to be allocated (about twelve billion Czech crowns).
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares on Monday have lived a star and the main indicators of the shares have recorded the largest rot from over a century ago.
The Dow Jones index was down by almost 7% and a similar scale was observed last time in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but as soon as it was found that the draft law was not approved, it fell free.
The Congress has dropped: the US government can expand 700 billion dollars to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators cut the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (about twelve billion crowns).
But it's not yet done.
The representatives of the Congress must therefore define some details of the mind before they publish the final form of the law and vote for it.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
This is what she said to the Reuters agency, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the Barney Frank room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and most fundamental psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
But then you will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be achieved.
Paulson: the Plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step forward."
"We have clarified our different opinions on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place Sunday.
The legislators' delegates met on Saturday and Sunday with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-cashable mortgage assets from financial companies, which would put financial companies at risk and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to bring the rest plan forward, but I think we're here," said Paulson.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is very much on the markets of the actions that are currently breaking up.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress even before Sunday.
In other words, investors want to calm down before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote for the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still make a lot of changes.
The total amount provided for in support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the rest of the sum in case the program does not perform its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision the Congress may, but he may exercise his right of vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has been maintained, i.e. to obtain funds to buy passive mortgage values, whose price has risen by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate Monday," the Senator mentioned.
US President Bush is also satisfied with progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush is satisfied with the positive progress of Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold paracautes
The president of the banking committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of the taxpayers from losses, the closure of the reduction budget, the fractionation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold paraquats to the managers of companies participating in the programme and is creating a committee that will control funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan relates to aid to owners of houses that have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates that it will cover with the aim of reducing monthly rates for creditors and allowing them to have their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and at what price the problem assets will be bought
This will be determined by how the financial sector and the government will share losses," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week it is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is that this week the representatives of the convention have reached an agreement on the support of this plan and that they are baptized as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
End of blood: MP3 readers against cell
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why we should seek an autonomous reader.
The choice depends on the way of use and the requirements of the future owner.
You may find it hard to buy high-quality bicycles to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not appear as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if there are hard-rock, jazz or blues violets on your cheeks, it is likely that you will dream of it.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compact music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly manage the market's twenty crown covers.
Two extremes of which there's enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the duration of the battery.
Some high-quality music players are able to do much more than simply read music, but they don't even make cell phones for mistakes.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone and texting, you can read music and videos, record both and have a camera, sometimes better and possibly even navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and palmaris, you will also have a minimizing computer.
It's a small miracle since no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell is also a source of disadvantages.
More functions you use on your cell phone and first the display indicator will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest) are much more effective.
As far as the economic cells are concerned, they can last for more than a few hours.
If you're still adding us, from when, some calls, you're looking for work to secure another battery, this is also true for the most expensive devices.
But you will not have this problem with a MP3 player, even the worst will last at least 9 hours in continuous functionality with a load.
A further problem arises when you download music from your cell phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices have a universal USB port and no more can be connected to your computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few readers of memory are able to make it unadjusted for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, other than some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most of the cell phones and readers are created only by a multimedia library ordered by the names of the performers, the name of the album, the genre or by the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
The readers are easier to manage, the cell phones can do more.
When you choose a particular device you are particularly interested in the resistance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly of the ease of use.
If music serves you especially from the bottom and if you listen to it all the days just briefly on the tram you have enough cell phone to read MP3.
This can be done now, obviously on any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about who the cell phone or the reader recognises.
The MP3 players all support them, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be right in this format.
In addition to this format, which belongs to the most common, most devices support WMA-format music.
Less AAC is available (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best cell phones also allow, for example, on-line music to buy.
Just visit, via the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another supplier) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument to buy a cell-reader.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is poor and is usually limited only to hits at the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of sale of music (whether via GSM , internet or wireless Internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
Most people always have their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to any fruit in the bag while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it is also dependent on this, if you always carry the cafiettes or at least the wireless earphone.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of cell-readers will be, for many, the price.
The most economics usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entry for the coffee shops.
The best and technically best-equipped cells and also with 3.5 mm for common coffee makers cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead of the advantage of readers , it is also easy to manage.
The simpler ones are not necessarily more economic (see our choice) than anyone really does to manage them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of manoeuvre to a time with the common stereo or perhaps the girdish, is of course.
There is no danger of misbehaving the start of the mobile Internet network and consequently of a giant data transmission ticket.
What device to use
Even the most economical cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (e.g. M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, return to the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy a low cost MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, you will prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and service comfort thus approaching the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more roads, whose walkman lines have the same use scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above brands ensure the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in line with maximum to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing – a virtual operator that requires traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
The fact that blind operators belong to the most expensive in Europe has been written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the accounts ČTÜ has also confirmed it, which has noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the regulation of roaming tariffs, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of mobile operators who are blind, SMS will cost less than the outside than the home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to start the dispute.
Maybe it sounds safe, even though we have three mobile networks and covering more than 100%.
Instead of operators of mobile telephones, they like to boast about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvorák, who once said that there was no other operator in the Czech Republic, is also often emphasised.
It is true that the traditional operator with its network may no longer have many possibilities. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequencies now.)
But there's another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry into the market of virtual operators itself has led to a significant reduction in prices, which should then have been responded to by traditional operators.
At the same time, even before the entry of scales such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, there were similar sounds in Great Britain like us.
However, it has been demonstrated that there is room for operators of the species and that they can have really succeeded.
In the end of the accounts for example, we don't have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual mobileking operator in Poland.
In the middle of the year, this operator has been able to acquire more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group in which the Czech Republic belongs among other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group.
In order to actually function, there are many less clients than a traditional operator.
They are not behind, that is to say, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually offer low cost, low price calls and SMS, which is often balanced with the offer of the most limited services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that costs at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobiling in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move too on a group-bersaglio not at all.
This operator therefore refers specifically to men.
"The real men choose mobileking operators who like and whom they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say a concept similar to that in Poland.
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
In addition to the point of view of services, it is relatively satisfactorily."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there'll ever be an operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"It is about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, negotiations do not have many expectations.
The increase in Mobilking will take place in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studničková, the printer of the Penta financial group.
It thus confirmed indirectly that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not strongly favouring this view.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything because there is no competitive potential.
For a while, it does not hide its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would do so would take another step towards becoming a real competitionr of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecoms.
And first you do better than it is.
We have repeatedly negotiated this opportunity with all the hidden operators of the mobile network.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," says the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
From the informal information it appears that the first virtual operator must have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not believe that in the Czech market there is room for the creation of a full-titled virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has turned to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň of the print section of Telefonika O2.
The specificities of the Czech market also apply to other operators.
The press spokesman for T-Mobil Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with statement O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial business project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build."
And it adds: "The T-Mobile network will hardly appear a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be considered as horizontal."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Add Miroslav Čepicky : "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most productive of our customers' view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with the competent operators
The attitude of mobile phone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, resulting in lower prices and thereby a decrease in profit.
Then why facilitate access to such a competitor?
The walls around creation U:fon testify that when operators have something they can recover from the same part.
Perhaps the great pressure was pushin' against ČTÜ in the U:fon creation period towards T-Mobile company.
This shows public access from the ČTÜ websites.
But now U:fon itself serves as an argument that does not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been slightly enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typeology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another competitor would affect him and above all his high-priced services."
However, the attitude of mobile phone operators is simply surprising the full interest of the blind regulatory bodies.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTU which is unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere with economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position in relation to all the problems.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator has been completed.
No such contract was concluded until now because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa , from the ÚOHS External Relations Section, said in response to our questionnaire.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead of the office which must defend the interests of consumers and above all the fact that no one benefits from its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Where virtual operators work jointly, we can note that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile phone services."
But of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not fall within the interests of ÚOHS.
It's really shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators as a result of their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is one, it is one.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrol is different from the result of coincidence and competition.
"The section has not found signs of anti-competitive behaviour on this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so there is no corresponding greater responsibility for its market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, which provides telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition.
On a market of the kind, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator there is always a need for the network's operator's agreement.
And the mobile operator has - at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of his network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not agree with this argument, ÚOHS should be at least a warning that three mobile operators are doing so extremely similar.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a quite frequent trick with which ÚOHS is out of the picture.
We've already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that many experts were expecting to improve the situation.
The representatives of ÚOHS must know this better, but perhaps their interests are different.
You can do it when no one looks.
While there is no need for us to continue the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of which are located in the silent mobile networks.
This is companies that publish their lists of prices for mobile phone services which are only partially published.
These are usually companies that are dealing with multilevel marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the eligible persons.
The magic is in fact that the company in relation to the operator is like a classic company customer, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special offers (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators prevent a similar prevalence.
"If there are cases of which you are talking about, of which we are interested, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and it could focus on the conclusion of cooperation with that company," answered Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that a kind of activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile phone operators.
In particular, in the case of the 3 companies mentioned above, thousands of customers can be treated.
No operator defends himself at the same time from a nature attitude.
From the activity of these companies they draw a non-inferior benefit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepickyy warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only one percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they can't fully have it as normal customers of mobile phone operators."
But this should be at least a surprise to the CTU.
In addition, another issue for UOHS is opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a kind of attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has sufficient rights to eliminate similar activities and if he does not want to, he will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all of this and that their commercial conditions prevent him from doing so.
When we won't be expensive anymore
As already mentioned in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time practically all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small market, to too much content, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, regulatory bodies have been involved, not from mobile phone operators, but from their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then reached the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies run from one to the other as a bollating potatoes.
For our experience we cannot escape the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes it more comfortable.
But we didn't get the sponge.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile phone market will return to engine.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly ÚOHS could remain incompatible with the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we will probably stop calling for higher prices than for the rest of Europe.
The new Czech wine has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Inno.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new registrations of the national Inno "Kde dorov myj" on the day of the Czech State's recognition.
The new registration of the Inno was made by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bälohlávek.
There are four versions available – assole with male or female voice, choir step and instrument edition.
The canto is headed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Inno revisions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bälohlävek considers the national song Czech one of the most beautiful women.
He has already told the radio "Český rzhlas" that he has chosen carefully to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, who are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to take care that both and the core, they have the clear statement, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national wine will celebrate the next year's 175^ anniversary.
The song "Where my home" was sung for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskäh theatre in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it.
The first strike of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national stage.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the Czech Republic.
How the "new" sounds inno
Prague's MHD Wednesday will be with you for the first time with an e-mail box.
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the subway, tram and bus will take out the first passengers that will take place in place of the ticket.
At this moment you can search for it about a hundred thousand people who own their Opencard bag.
Passengers can buy that from 30 days and 90 days and years (which will come from the first January 2009) and at the same time get their mail downloaded from the Infopoints and the Transport Company's offices and to the metro plant Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andrí, Roztyly, Letnýny, Kobylissy, Rajská zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
The sizes can be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers benefited from the service before noon.
Those who start using the Internet service can completely forget sports in the meters where they had to make long files for card tickets.
The cutout is purchased online and on Opencard it is charged on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a sports hall with a personal format that will help interested people to buy on the Internet and even record on their card the credit they bought."
In addition to the libraries, you will be able to load the electronic sizes on Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these banknotes?
They're red, they're dreaming of the ticketers and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the Roztyly, Budějoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year which should be expected," Opatrný concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the author from the bankomat.
The banking service that will work tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard bag and prior payment of the cutout, you will be loaded up.
The electronic tessers will be valid from morning to morning not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
This is in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which residents of the central Bohemian communities take to reach capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are coined controllers of card readers with which they verify the temporary and zone validity," he explained how to control the tickets Philip by the Ropid organisation, which points to the time of the collective transport of Prague.
Urban buses have the reader of integrated cards in the car home.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but more needs to support the Opencard at a certain point next to the house.
This is how the author checks the validity of loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of loaded cuts, there is nothing easier than to ask the author about this type of information," Drapal added.
Passengers who take the city buses and will not remember, when they break down the cutting validity, can return to the self-service bankomt, where the cuts are loaded on the paper.
Here they will display information about the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the South in 1945 asked to include Shumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Southern Germans rebelled in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is in addition to the letter preserved in a private archive and now stored in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask the US President not to allow the return of the "Shuumava district" – occupied by Hitler under the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that the American units arrive in the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," writes the letter signed with the words "People who have the destiny of Shumava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annex to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans only hope for brutality, lack of respect, incompetence, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take the protection on Shumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a state of foreignness, which oppresses and devastates ethnic minorities and has not contributed for anything, even for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," writes the letter.
The reason why authors can't sign it is the supposed fear of the seven sales by the "secret printers".
If the President of the United States had to question the conviction of the Germans of Shumava , it would be sufficient to hold in the district a referendum on the desire of its citizens to become part of the United States or to live under the US's standard.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of postwar war, according to some witnesses, it properly describes the expectations of then the Germans of the South.
Although the Germans had to at least insist that they would have been moved from the Republic, only a few of them would have accepted the whole possibility of moving from the Republic.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others believed that they would simply have stayed in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and imprisoned in Holštýn , dozens of other blind Germans went to find him so that he could teach him the Czech.
"These thought that once the blind man came home, he would have made him comfortable," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, he said, would have been transferred from the Republic on the basis of Benez's decrees.
Don't think about it!
The emotional campaign will touch the authors
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
It could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébíček is expected to discourage drivers from a dangerous behaviour to the volunteer.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, Internet but also on volunteers.
Autists should be encouraged by the rapid guide and by the effect of alcohol on the flight.
And remind them also to put the belt before leaving.
He wants to touch in consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not professional leaders.
What's going to happen in the spot?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the fact that it is "sanguous" slogan throughout the campaign:
Don't think about it!
The word "don't think" is written on the chart.
And in a blood bag there's the word "paying."
This must mean that a person can in a way of entertainment pay with his own life.
The spots will "spaventer" the spectators by 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of the victims of accidents can be seen commonly.
It is thus promised to reduce the number of incidents and deaths on hidden roads.
The spot was prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and sticks for drivers
"The carat and cotton system works with the authors.
The carat for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The basston is the danger of the penalty or accident.
It is necessary to remind leaders of the risk," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of Hospital Na Homolce.
And that's why we want information campaigns in print and, above all, negative publicity, believe the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn the drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed warning of danger, it will probably meet with the environment soon and the leaders will not pay any more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all the territories occupied in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Interim Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, expressed his appreciation for the restoration of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the mountains of Golan, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that is to say that it will be necessary to restore almost all areas (worked) if not all of them," said Olmert to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories but to the Palestinians we will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any refund would also include East Jerusalem .
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want the Russians or the Spaniards to take the passports, as happened to one of my best friends, should give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the event of two attacks in the city of July, during which some people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arab.
It won't work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from the mountains of Golan, i.e. the condition that it is necessary to conclude this peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the movement of the Scythians); they will have to give up their standing support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the movement of the Scythians) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Question after the incident: Are Stewards illegal in buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padova of the Pullman of the Student Agency company, the question arose whether Stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws seriously and formally, Steward's activity is in conflict with road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanselka.
The incident last week with which a 22-year-old hostess lost his life was caused by a truck that cuts the road to the pulman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the car driver at the less secure place of the pulser, although there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or freeze quickly even when the coffee or newspapers are distributed.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or less than foot-and-mouthed according to the movement manual.
If passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
The Student Agency's buses did not take place, confirmed it on the website Aktualn .cz the director of the Radim Jancúra ditta.
"We have assessed this with the Ministry and initially did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
Afterward it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have assigned the place," he expressed his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the Stewart – no law deals with the regulation of this role."
No regulation, however, prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds the spokesman Hanselka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the law is sufficient to address this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approved positions.
Everything," she says.
Category buses in urban areas where there are limited foot stations and maximum speeds, interurbans with foot stations with higher and long legs without foot stations with the maximum allowed speed and seating with safety belt.
Like in the air, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Horrín does not find the problem of the background in the movement of the Stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet course there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
Not even there is safe when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can break his head."
"If the bus makes a frozen noise, obviously the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the urban pulse or on the tram.
The transporter must resolve the safety of the Stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jancúra is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers the services of the Stewards..
This doesn't take about two hundred.
The director even considers their mission dangerous after the incident.
"As soon as I have the feeling that I must consider the profession of the Steward as a dangerous job, I will reject it.
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers while they're on their way.
It would also reduce costs," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a line fraction compared to the Student Agency, has motivated the absence of the Stewards on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hosts, we've been opposing each other since the beginning.
First or then it will end with a fatal incident," he said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has occurred.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young hostess of the Plzeň region died, which had been working for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck is probably coming out of the emergency course without using the frequency and blocked the road to the pulse.
The driver of the pulser tried to avoid it with a dirty handle, but he pulled it with the front right.
Jancúra rejected the fact that the two places reserved for the stawart rest had been occupied.
"It is not possible to book these places in long-term pulses, they are indestructible."
The fingertip has in mind to accuse the driver of the truck.
The Agency shall not wait for the Court's judgment to pay damage to the girl's family, but shall expect financial compensation from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not visible
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than one year, could lead to the precise movement of the Stewarts on board the buses.
"No concrete results have been achieved, however.
They don't consider them so much pulses, they take more of the point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the cell during the guide," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewart's activity as a major threat to passenger safety," concludes the porter Havelka, that road safety control is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Francoforte
There are no words in the letter of the WestLB director addressed to the house staff.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market centre of the financial group's savings funds" through the meeting of the unit of Düsseldorf bank institution with the Deka-bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting benefits in such a company.
In addition, this whole Union could be a decisive boost to further links in the Länder banks.
This is how it is read when a board of directors in difficult times wants to show the ability to act.
Because the WestLB disaster is still under intense pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervision Service Entrepreneurship, noting time has gone by to the regional government of Northern Rhine - Westphalia that time is devoted to seeking a future solution.
I have a link between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Resparmio Cases because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB is probably already talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, Deka-Bank Franz Waas referred to the act of presenting the invoice of the first half of the year that a merger of the house near Magonza with a national bank such as the Helaba or the West LB did not make sense.
However, the Deca Administrative Council, which is brought by regional banks and savings pools, has delegated to the Management Board to conduct talks with the West LB on common contracts.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations have, as they say in the business scene, just started.
From the Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those who account for more in France for business, not the first time when it comes to consolidate the savings fund sector.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that the Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this three-party association, there's nothing to do with it.
As soon as projects were published, the Asian regional bank was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach agreement.
The Renania-Palatinate Regional Bank went instead to the Baden-Württemberg Regional Bank in Stockcarda.
But they often thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl , president of the Helaba Board of Directors , he expressed his opposition to design games to meet with his home.
In addition, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with the Baden-Württemberg could be checked first.
For Helaba it's not all good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will be left without hands.
In the South we would now have the junior partner, although so far we have had a much better financial crisis in Monaco and Scotland.
The Association of Asia-Turingia Saving Cases, which participated with 85 percent of Helaba, placed the cateneration at the meeting with the WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasons are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to combat the various business models of individual houses.
In June Merl noted that the decisive question with which the future of regional banks would be ensured would not have been answered by the German savings fund association.
In the end, the West LB division may also come out, which is of course not desired.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of individual parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time for Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says it's all different.
Behind them next to the 5l bars of the Kaiser brand is a massive barbaric and shows about 200 passengers who are the deep tones that can produce from the gol.
Elena first gives Luca a pack and then a kiss.
I came from Bologna to Verona.
From here on the bus parking near Porta Nuova station, there are 23,45 four passengers on this evening with Monaco's destination, Burra's Festival", I arrive at 6.30 p.m.
Three corridors are reserved for Italians, in another Brazilian alone.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so funny, says Marco, that it's not for the Italians.
Marco who wears a long hat with fake fur hats and a couple of glasses with large silver bars belong to the buses.
From 5 years to Octoberfest, this year is 3 tour.
The night shift, from day to day at the party, goes back to 22.30.
Nighttime would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
THE cost of 45 Euro includes travel, the welcome of the Brindisi with the Kaiser beer, made according to the standards of Bavarian generosity, the disease case and the German guide – Marco has attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the turn of the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the passengers sleep.
Better this way, they will still need their forces.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian flag on the A9 highway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as planned, the group of Marco arrives at 6.30 on the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are grouped together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First: put the yellow hat on.
On it to the left there is "Oktoberfest" next to Marco's travel agency's internet address: "Conoscersivijaddo.it".
Second: "When I open the doors of the bull's tent, it means running!" Marco says first thing in the morning.
"Run!" running and occupying the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not before, but we are blocking, and not all the yellow bears sitting on the same panties, divide themselves into the current space!"
The oral cost is 8.25 Euro, Marco.
And don't forget to give food.
"Show the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they will disappear."
Third: "We'll meet again at 22.30 points! Got it?"
You're already going to the party.
On the road one attacks as follows through the jungles on trees, the road maps and even a public cartel of a large popular Bavarian party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as "the weekend of the Italians".
There are no accurate data, there are 50 thousand, which are born to cross the Alps and invasive the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors are due to come from Italy.
Monaco's police are strengthened with 7 High Adige agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarese Red Cross, which provides statistics on nationalitys, where Italians first have 200 medical care in front of English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the tent of Hofbräuhaus.
1. Dream Nights for the creditors of the Real Estate Hypo
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that policy has used the word "relative" and has also stressed that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started at the end of the week.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, receives from a German bank consortium a billion credit in order to protect themselves from market turbulence.
An expert in the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
The Real Estate Hypo must only pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from private banks and from the public.
Deep down are the losses of the Defa affiliate.
The State financer according to a newspaper article has been refinanced in the short term – which is no longer possible due to market confidence.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves were reduced by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of capital itself dropped from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current incomes and net income from financial business fell to 0 compared to last year, the benefits from increases were both of questions and of certain actions as to the liquidation of loans by more than 70% of the EUR 5 million.
Only because of higher earnings from the reimbursement of sub-ordered compensation costs which are incurred by the restructuring of the former Defa group and by the return of interest under the single text of tax laws and the management of business for business associations, the negative profit has been sufficiently moderate with about 16%.
The former public financer after being privatised in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were incorporated into the Aerial Bank.
As the performance in the classic state funding was too low, the Defa committed more to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint private and state investors projects (PPPs) and was internationally diversified.
The Real Estate Hypo must now amortise the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends were canceled.
Already in 2007 there were 2/3 reductions.
The Real Estate Hypo after the use of the Depfa is an important financer of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the market between banks compared to other institutions because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Because of the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the grant of credit between banks in most cases was exhausted because banks accumulated liquidity.
The Real Estate Hypo is required annually for part of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 billion – short-term funding means.
According to the Hypo Real State, the group's financial requirement was covered by credit for a certain period and the company was protected from the influence of international monetary markets for the most non-functional.
In other sources it is felt that, thanks to the money, funding is ensured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Steering Committee, Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE Group would not need short-term cash markets.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervision Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that the profitability of the HRE Group is still guaranteed.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
There will be no guarantee in view of the dynamic and impreciseness of the crisis.
It is possible that funding is not fully used.
But neither should the opposite be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank had learned what it was going to fail, the immediate rescue failed to calm the souls.
The operating course is 75% over the 3.30 Euro.
They're pretty good with each other's courses.
While the previous debt is almost irrevocable, the rates of post-marketed credit are dropped.
In particular, there are those who have been attacked by Württemberg-Hypo affiliates, which are significantly more likely to decline over 2009.
Before the walls of Della HRE seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, their validity must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system following the strengthening of the bank and institution itself.
Until the central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an amortization of the years within the term.
Even if it comes into force, what no one is looking forward to – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
However, concerning the information raised due to partial statistics, the probability is almost certain that it has become a justifiable hope.
In particular, it will create for long-term investors some sleep nights with the decision if they are divided by their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the countervailing duty on surpluses.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should be presented to Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-nel the new Japan account exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
Like I was excited.
I even liked going to school.
I'm staying at Tokyo's border towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to reach Tachibana High School.
I had to find the road alone and luckily I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first lesson doesn't seem to have been set as well as by us in Bassa Saxony.
The students arrived on a plane from 8 to 8 in the afternoon, until 8.40 a short conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before I started the lesson, I was moved to introduce myself.
I'm not that kind of talker in front of people, in front of a class of 40 schools.
Since I had not yet had the school uniform, I was put in an old gona by the host mother, along with a shirt, blue pants and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I was sitting in front of the table and I tried to say well: "Sayonara Where she Sylvana..." - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I'm having a party between a week and my birthday.
At that time I was very glad I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have bashed, ragged and made signs and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
That's what I've known since my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessico of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I run fast to my place.
The girl next to me laughed, for her was an honor to sit next to an exchange school.
The rest of the lesson time was continued quietly, but when he sounded the gong, I was seated in the true sense of the word.
They all talked messyly and laughed at me and laughed at me with questions – then it was really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
In the break, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother made me even the lunch panier-- it's different from the new German panties.
I had taken off with species, salsicines, cetrilol salad and algae, fruit and a species of influenza with meat and fat..
To tell the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the pears put under the soles, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Bento made of herself, prepared quite artificially, with the hope of making the boy aware of it during the rehearsal.
I read it in my Manga smoke.
I'm really curious if I can find it.
"Why is Japan exactly?" my friends asked me when I told them that I would like to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years with fervor.
And to better understand the smoke and culture they contain, first or later I started learning Japanese.
I was completely convinced that we would come once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, usage and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a scarf escape when they feel the danger.
The scientist Joseph Le Doux convinced him: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how can you see if, when they act in our own way, they have our own feelings?
On the Internet magazine "Edge" for a few years, articles of scientific knowledge are published.
6. ONLY in a series, there are chosen answers to the question, "What do you think is true, without trying it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about the sense or in general about conscience, we enter an improbable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do. That's supposed to be dead, escape or attack.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a similar subjective feeling.
I don't believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it is often associated with the side front cortex with human consciousness, associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our awareness dependent on prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus adopted on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic feature should be presented in the way of speaking about man: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said that it is related to conscience.
In this case animals may be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how the conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, by analysing it through its own experience due to the special hardware, their research will present major problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of consciousness, but there is another aspect of the consciousness that science would be more easily accessible.
The processes of animal consciousness without regard to their content could be analysed, and this is what happens in the short-term memory studies of primates, in particular for the example of visualization.
So for this principle, that Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it comes first to the neural correlates of consciousness that cause mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the pre-frontal cortex for the implementation of the visualisation.
What is it about feelings?
I assume that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
So what we indicate as "dread" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) takes up the memory of work.
Thus, feelings are closely linked to regions of the cortex, which characterise primates and in particular human beings.
With the speaking nature we create subtle sounds of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Regarding this, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings are the primary activity of the regions of the body of the cortex and the head pallet, like Jack Pankseep, who, however, focused more on palaecephalo.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could definitely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
At a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unambiguous.
Pankseep gives arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears as fear, is likely to happen so with the senses in both cases: but how could you check if rats and human beings try the same thing when they behave similarly?
A crash in the face of danger escapes as if he were afraid?
In my eyes the simple behavioral similarity cannot yet show any vital similarity.
And that's the neural comparison that continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoncephalus, even a brain.
But is paleoncephalo responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for human beings, how would you like to show it on the rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, maybe the insects (who knows him), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human conscience is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In any case, there are neural progress here, in agreement with the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don't do research on language and conscience in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered myop, but I prefer to take steps forward instead of constantly fighting against a wall.
I'm an emotional practice for the point.
The President of the UEFA Platini: referral to Poland and Ukraine
Vice-President Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europe with Poland," said Vasjunik
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work is just started and there is still much to do in both countries"
Both home-owned countries are soppy in the March table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Where appropriate, the number of stages to be allocated to Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we must work with the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Association Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep our eyes open"
A more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After several scandals the management of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It would suggest "the serious danger that PZPN is not able to operate under the rules," Drzewicki told the Polish PAP Information Agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation at EM 2012 will not suffer."
A number of exhibits of the first division only in the last season were condemned for manipulation, in the end it was decided that the beginning of the League should be postponed at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid is angry
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has grain with the ex: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan told an adult his ex Dennis Quaid.
He seems to be angry and angry.
The War of the Roses late for the former couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two actors of Hollywood are now arguing with each other about a serious dispute - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time said about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been far from my unfaithful, and this has been very painful."
The port of the traditions would have come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "smoothing of the soul" was the work of Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – tells the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adult husband was clear: it would be "unaudited", said the 50th train to "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the first time repeats and rebuilds the story of our report".
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the son-in-law they had together, again "there are no public memories of pain and despair, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from separation, Quaid is newly married and will soon become father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the phrase: "My life is going forward in any case.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family that's going for the best."
Cheap air tickets and hotel deals
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were more economic than last year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be managed up to 50% more economical
Cheapest hotels and hostels have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the US Express financial provider and travel provider.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter noted a clear decline in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have been increased for years, nights in many places are already worth the price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review averaged around 6.9 compared to 2007
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 % lower than last year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the poor dollar share, which would have led to a "calient desire to travel American tourists"
Even financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would be affected by the rescheduling of hotel prices in a stronger way from industrial centres such as Hanover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% hold the record in Europe
As far as flight prices are concerned, the trend in the first quarter is still above:
Due to the rise of the Cherosene, the passengers of the Economy Class had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range flights of fuel would be allocated up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June the prices of the Economic Class air tickets are averaged by 12.5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in Business, however, price changes have been much longer.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose from 11.9 %, and in the second quarter dropped from 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices have declined.
The reason for price fluctuations would be economic growth on the one hand, explains the company.
The request in many segments of the air travel market has been deleted.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition by the agreement on open heavens, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The critical situation would be the removal of non-refundable contracts at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared failure in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats the Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the VV of Amburg becomes a Capolilist.
There is no group of 11 that works in the Luhukay region.
Here Christoffer Klein is worse the fortune landing for the national player Marko Marin .
The gladbach player entered first late in the game and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the amburg arena's corridor.
It wasn't big success in catacombs, the game break was over and most of them were back in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly 3 decades, enjoying an even greater estimate of some old players.
And so his monitor has also found a hearing in the high spheres.
Assistant allelener Cornelius Jol has announced and has raised the police on the approval mark.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change in position has not been verified.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt would have been "more relaxed".
For 1 zero those in Hamburg must thank the head hit by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Amburg players.
"It was a great victory," repeated Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV this Monday will be 121 years old.
The spectators have already celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, if they themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the grading on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a whole year without a real party.
"we are able to put everything in place," said Marcell Jansen.
The presentation shows that the provisional certificate from the table is more than an indication of the improbability of the sample than of the domination of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals later engaged – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defense officer of the Petric gate as well as Jansen submitted to the FC Bayern – finds that it is slowly itself, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more Drebbling," Jol said.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be exactly the same.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the explosions of the coal that freeze quickly, death is now on you for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates a sample – the anomaly of Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, with which they get additional slant/spint/oscillation in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens has used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What the scholars have been amazed for years is that the races don't behave as we would expect under the law on gravity.
Angi comes to irregularity in speed.
The probes become the fastest or slower supply.
So far the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year of rebuffed Swing-by's anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps it will address the general theory of Albert Einstein's relationship, which describes the force of attraction of the material with a curvature of space, could not be quite the same.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study strongly believes as before Einstein did not fail, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by through such a dark matter that astronomers have discovered in the cosmos.
"Responsible to anomaly may be the dark matter which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
From the existence of dark matter, space students are known only for about 10 years.
It is evident from her that she is a force of attraction, whose effect on other heavenly bodies is seen.
Instead of everything invisible, it means that you do not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially some visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter is at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists captured in Egypt would be again free, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release of 6 sequentials, they were killed.
In the south of Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
The risk treaties are already in progress.
The Germans are always in the shadow of the sequentials.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists captured in Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This has consistently referred to the state television of Egypt, the Arab publisher Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our concitants and other obstacles have been released
We are examining their health status," said Frattini.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safety, referred to Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a shipment in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
There is still little clear behind the retreat of a shooting that occurred before the release of the hostages: so the kidnappers, following the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, would be ready for the arrest, before the Sudanese army was killed by surprise 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," said the officer.
It would have been "still only tried to deliver the obstacles," when the unexpected came "this surprise".
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had been killed by gun attacks by 6 of their kidnappers and captured by 2 of them.
Securitors had claimed a loan of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been given by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would have been delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the sequentials wanted to release women in detention after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been detained until the rapists had had a safe escape route.
The German ambassador to Cairo refused a position regarding the relationship .
The abuses of the "they brought to the murder"
Years of abuse by the patriarch brought a woman to kill herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, by Stithians, Cornovaglia, was imprisoned for 6 years after he admitted eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he was regularly upset by his daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had been killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and living in Coventry, Trerise was troubled and sold her before having sex, while the mother was out working in a pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornovaglia.
Her daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Minister Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfist and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and had "morrowed with life".
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself focusing on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's mother, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The tie and the belt".
"I didn't bother him sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetist, and for her victim she must have been a terrorist, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This sorry saga ends with the victim who takes his life.
Even more difficult is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to be completed before the court."
I know the effects Stephanie’s father and mother had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, has learned the BBC.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the less delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal attempt.
The BBC defence representative Frank Gardner said that the movement would have come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They thought this was treated internally at the Mod and at the branch office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and the capacity of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home and taken to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
The English construction companies could face an account of more than £80m after saving Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has given 14 billion stars to protect the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savings deposits.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking savings money, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion sterline will be reimbursed if Bradford & Bingley's walls are rescinded.
But the interest that will grow in time will be paid every year to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will grow in time will be charged to 700 financial companies that accept deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is ironic that those institutions that have acted wisely... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The treasure estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million esters in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlings to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Construction Society Association, told the BBC that he believes it is wrong.
"It is disturbing that those institutions that have acted prudently in the house-to-house recovery market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," said Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members shall end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The salty milk has 5 penny per litre
The people in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in the price of its milk intake for an extra of five pennies per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
The retail sellers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Ex-Minister of Bangladesh refused the bail
A Bangladesh court refused a previous Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's bail warrant, which means she could be arrested when she comes back to the country.
His attorneys said that the court refused to grant them a bail for having pulled 50 million tacs (729.700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of Parliament.
The case is one of the many allegations of corruption against you.
The long-term political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is planned for the next week but his party, Awami League, asked that the temporary government of the country supported by the military day before the whole freedom.
They say that while you were going abroad to medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can stay free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high court has rejected the request for protection for Sheikh Hasina, leading that she can't have the security since she's already out on medical care," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huk said.
"We will present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs security to return to the country from abroad to prepare the December elections.
He is expected to return home to Sheikh Hasina after October 17, he said on Sunday an senior leader of the Awami League party.
She was arrested last year after the government joined the military force took power, but was released in June to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Afghan anti-political campaign
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, says the UN.
The UN carried forward a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it can't reach children in the part of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this was happening despite the promises of Taliban people who would not have attacked or prevented thousands of people from carrying vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the TV reval.
BSkyB was told by the Court of Appeal of the Competition to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB's participation prevented competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB obtained participation in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raised doubts about the independence of ITV, making it possible for the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surprise its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of the US Prosecutor
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a Special Public Ministry to examine the licensing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation takes place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Criminal Justice of the Office of Administrative Officers is reported.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made out of fear that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
The Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to prevent justice.
"Several allegations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or confirmed," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a public special ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers were licensed for low-performance.
But later it became clear that licensed lawyers were no longer evaluated by many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the licensing was motivated by policy.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in the judicial action against the Republican members of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
The U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring forward cases in court on behalf of the government.
They may be licensed at any time, but they cannot be licensed for political reasons.
The chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was then at the time of the licensing, and finally he took his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice were licensed.
(The report of the Inspector-General was very critical in the role of Mr Gonzales in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the licensing process, which had served as his leader and had been extremely prominent during the process.
Other officials, including former assistant chief Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
Meat Loaf's epic will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at Q Awards for its epic inno Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize to the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to win recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album hit by Meat Loaf in 1977.
The Coldplays will run nominations for this year's prizes, being in the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But the Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell album remained almost nine years in classification and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - a true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003 after she collapsed on the floor.
In 2007, he was forced to cancel the concerts.
It came up later that there was a tape on a vocal string.
Dark streets of town, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of Avenues, Boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others just for use.
But even many veteran taxists and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, especially because they have never heard of it.
The main road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it resembles more than a powdered vehicle than an active road.
There's no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal landing.
The road must, however, have amplifiers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and shops that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-term neighbors who say they were hit by the road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the former gentleman's district.
But the city's maintenance and development department, which has road control, doesn't care to have it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Use of the Land of the Circuit Commission, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay have drawn up a proposal for the real estate company to buy roads.
But the committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to present next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to have Extra Place," he said.
"There may be proposals to system and manage it, which may be made by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay has been announced many months ago to want to reopen the small street and install seats to sit, including some to use for a coffee in which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the street was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean she wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this remote village and transform it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Preservation Commissioner, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a historical printed reading.
Some believe that it took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company owned by Philip Minthorne was split up between his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not declared.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that ended in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is probably better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The land was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was an immunization column, brands of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, sheets, cord."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about East Village's "genrtification", opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, leading to the fact that the part of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of the city almost for no change that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiahah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Little Nostalgic to the City on the Way of Extension"), published part of a talk on the city's history that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an empty space without exit, also empty of day and delimited iron storage doors and windows with raisins, with old days of weeks running along the bases."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same in a recent night.
A rat ran fast through the back of the street near a door leading within the CBGB, which is now the site of a aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of beer empty from 22 o'clock close to a group of abandoned daily freshies.
A few people have said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but they suggest they should be a little pretty.
Mr. Fields, on his part, said that some people were also thinking of underestimating the attractiveness of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in black, dirty and unpleasant places."
The bilingual debate: membership in English
In this point of View Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member of California's studies and senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
To attract Spanish voters is really a complicated thing.
The education projects of Barack Obama are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign noted that "Afro-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," which is true.
In order to combat these shortcomings in achieving the objectives, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitory bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in a class of languages different from English, does not take into account his interest in closing learning differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
The school students are for the majority of Spanish and low-income students.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
However, among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of the students conducted the higher level test in the 2008 state of mathematics.
Another surprising 93 percent of the fourth students have done the test of the level of expertise on art-di-language-English.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of competences and a "no excuse" attitude.
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the constructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We've had a great success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered class 12 months after you couldn't be able to figure out what it was."
"It works," he observed "for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep to repeat it in other schools to most Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-term support for bilingual education) and its continued support for bilingual education prevents Mr. Obama's response from coming forward.
While he agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama has recently made the point that people should stop worrying about "solo-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps of achievement, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than hate or ban them.
The oil collapses rapidly and renews economic fear
Petroleum prices have dropped dramatically on Monday due to the concerns that even the US savings plan for financial markets may not be able to raise the economy.
The future of the grain fell from 7 per cent to $99.80 at the barrel at New York's market exchange in the early morning operations.
Prices have lost more than 20 dollars in the bars since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets for raw materials have been cut off from Wall Street's financial grip, and from a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a little $145.26 at the bars in June, prices were rounded up to almost $90 at the bars at the beginning of this month, before it was raised again on the basis of a serious uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety has influenced new investors on Monday even after the congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement at the end of the week about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was hidden from the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from being the past.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will understand the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the fraternal negotiations at the end of the week had led to a rescue agreement " appear to have failed to live up to the market's sense.
As the economic situation worsen, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to be calmed.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates markets has become uncertain," the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the first material will not be able to escape the infection.
From a perspective of materials first our most pressing concern is to the extent that the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Banking analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year while household oil consumption has slowed down due to the slowdown in economic growth, reducing oil and gas prices by around 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the uniform of the Jets in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it take place on the second Thursday, when the Jets transformed a game without points into a hill.
"You've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equalized the greyness of the dangerous clouds that prevailed over them with a fun game.
Then the quarterback Brett Fabre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon where their growing tone took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for other two touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback is down and another with 10 seconds you stayed at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Fabre of all the trips to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were playing arrest games, the defense hit the Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The Cornerback Darrelle Revis has intercepted a vagative launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Eric Smith's security has predicted another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces Warner's fumble.
The last tournament, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals were on advantage over that palle property, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely had footed a target from 20 yards, for an advantage from 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever signed in a room.
When he was asked to describe the passion, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselasia restated above its world record
Haile Gebrselasie of Ethiopia has demonstrated again because many consider it the best marathon ever, breaking the world's same record to the marathon in Berlin on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a race of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race in favour of the plane at 2:03:59, Gebrselassia sends in francs for 27 seconds its previous score of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasie points to the 26th world record of such a scalordiditious career that has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the millimetre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasie jumped out of Pechino's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively - that air pollution would worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - lonely and 48 degrees to the start, 55 degrees to the arrival - Gebrselasse won Sunday with an outstanding average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Not long ago fundamentalists such as Gebrselasse and Paul Tergat del Kenya have gone to long distances, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil came to Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After winning Sunday, Gebrselasie told reporters that two weeks ago she had lung cramps and lacked a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left him fresh, unfashioned.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselasie to the reporter.
"It was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at last everything went well."
It was a bit critical - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having excessively orchestrated its streets, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on the apript as if it were a middle-end race, and placing world record on the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely reduce the size of the competences of Gibraltar as a marathon.
With the step of four Kenyans Sunday, Gebrselasie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kambai and Charles Kamathi, held the Gebrselassie competition after the apripts have disappeared.
A little over three thousand from the arrival, Gebrselasie made a final commitment to leave Kambai, which ended at 2:05:36, improving its best personal time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, has completed a significant year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
Pechino Games have been lost with what is described as a serious incident, but it is cured to win in Berlin, making its best personal time for almost five minutes in the third marathon that has run.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, allowing a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to share with a great distance, taking her back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magrasa of Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city on the other hand, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the park with extensive theme on the mountains of Orlando, a few thousand miles from the beautiful, from the noise, from the vastness, the quiet city where pride and the complications of the African-American experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three fields of croquet, 300 brown skins, 300 good nutrients, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
In many ways, however, the city that he described - and which stops tourists from including it in Florida's tourist guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a part of it.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often refused to share their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, don't know what's missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential term, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain dependent on the sideder's view.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," Hortense Jones said, 59 years old, a resident of the city's oldest church.
"You must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a triumphal paradox and difficulty.
It is a historical model of black power and a community of nearly 2,400 where the rate of poverty is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example of the shade of rural culture of the south - sometimes disintegrated, sometimes prized - born by the American slave.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented the world to her native city through sincere books, rich in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide turned the city, just outside the Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama
Low as a grandmother in both life and literature, Hurston brought the readers into the store owned by the first St. John Clarke of Eatonville, to become more private.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, brown with white finish, with its well-tened and short gardens, where Howard Miller was always swimming, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the Dash widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of all kinds and anything suitable for the passenger rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston joined Eatonville with self-government but also with analfabetism, second weddings and sex.
Obviously this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a picture that everyone appreciated.
"Now she said it like it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who killed Hurston by calling men singing giant songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who often returned from his family to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston pivoted in the city, he usually arrived without warning in a trionfan Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is also benefiting from dignified clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were suspicious.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, added, scouring his seat on the back floor over the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books went out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in a tomb with no sign in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremony, and no big conference.
"I don't think they understand their contribution to the world or their stay to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-way highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-way road.
The expansion of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western boundary of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Strong integration, in addition to other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the Community
In the fifties, the battle against racial mascot brought hatred on the door of the community's home.
"During that period, a group of white boys came over and gave gifts and things to people who were sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They got a cocoon from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made to the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "a rather insult than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that the disintegration of schools, although they have been positive in some respects, underlines Eatonville's cohesion and reiterates the confidence of his young people.
"The black children were used to be hugged - I remember this - you kissed your teacher in the morning, you kissed your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This difficulty, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You didn't break your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, anyway, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame the prejudices, as he did, with happy security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long way to the tomb without a flag of Hurston and began fighting for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a biographical attack on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the library cabinets, re-introducing it into the U.S. Canon.
The road project came right while his most famous daughter had re-worked the lights of the rebellion.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Houston in 1988 to show what could damage the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the memorial.
A few years later, I pulled him out of his street project.
"The five courses of the resurrected highway brought what would be called high-speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd makes it easier to say, "Now save Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image the city has.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical record in 1998.
A new library at a single piano (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a newly renovated and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s of 1800.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit previously requested is required for most of the interview, in some things - such as the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who are seeing black men in the fields - have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a teacher of gravity, with a weakness for bright red, are still afraid their island community will become French.
However, as soon as the Horston festival expanded, there was also a high level of civil pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, no worse and proud, creative, great worker, shocked and confused like other ethnic races and groups in America.
It is a sincere civil love that can be felt in the voice of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, aged 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work in the local government or for the Department of Police, who said he might need help.
And even younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon after the show in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a grateful city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspapers and the huge television screens of Times Square, they would not be encouraged to stay in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never mind that the glass offices, at the top of their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "hard day in office" from the 1929 sky.
The factors cause metal bags for the pastry through the marciapedes, transporting muffin vessels for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans break their legs between condoms carrying, like human mice, 50 and broken camice rocks attached to a stick on their back.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning luggage to the food carts on the marciapedi, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between the 16th and 19th working days.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with the whole talk of destruction and sorrow, I decided to open a new booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Even if I had planned the facsimile so that it would match the late afternoon break to my JP Morgan Chase branch, a number of wind was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the casino's sports hall, to withdraw money or deposit it, but in front of the customer's sports hall, where old customers order booked subscriptions, tourists ask for directions for the large Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would then have learned from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for my own sake.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from which pendants do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from so-called trophyt (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of public savings banks whose branches operate only within one state, and they say to treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In the past days the Washington Mutual, a bank with 327 billion dollars in assets, has been subject to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkese were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of 440 billion dollars, was looking for a buyer that saved her.
The employees and businesses that were facing me, who were unable for another class, were putting their money at a bank that was perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more security at Wall Street.
The common New Yorkese in the last few weeks have become financially competent.
A woman to my Chinese supermarket of trust, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank was failing, and her beloved Director General Dick Full in all family, as if lying with a bad partner.
And Lyn, the uniformed portal, almost 50 percent of my condom, has changed the subject in respect of our normal conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
A profanated Muslim tomb while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right-hand side of the Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islam" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They bring signals of type to those street representatives of Moscow with a red line that passes through the middle.
The police blamed the right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim seminary in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the right-wing have won a lot at the national general elections.
More than 90 graves have been severely damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in an hour between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
The criminals have traced with the Hebrew spray symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but the detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask the extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related in some way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the provocation, which occurred at the end of Ramadan, months of religious relevance to Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria has embarked on a spiritual search trip following its turn to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right parties that have taken nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have launched a campaign with increasingly anti-immigrance tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, gave a campaign against the cattle and burkas and also expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to flag the construction of museums and mines, leading to political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis done immediately after the elections, which have established the right-hand side as the strongest political block of the nation, indicating that the change has been brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitzer.
At Gary Glitzer, the glamour star of the sex abuser on minors, was prohibited from traveling to France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that they wanted to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after he gave the judges the evidence of previous Glitter arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, a true name of Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's award in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman from the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's fair, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present by person."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad as requested by the register of sexual harassment offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
The failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said I didn't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A Kent police officer said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have adequate complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we will work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country in order to minimize any risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom 27 months after he was imprisoned in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls 10 and 11 years of age.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he had to sail on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have done so by means of passport checks and finally taken a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow's 3rd terminal on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully made a request for an order for him to be registered as a sexual offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having had images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt relieved and happy that Glitter had been stopped by traveling to France and Spain.
"Photo by the teacher far from the scene to alienate the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
Don't touch or fly or dress from the front.
Only the essence of the great masters of the flamenco, spewed from the concentration which characterises interpretation, to look at the man or woman's relaxed appearance.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those times away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they must not go into stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alters the theatre of some dancers, dancers and guitarists on the stage with the least known side of these masters.
To this end, the photographer offers an original iconography of the flamenco, covering it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this ball, every day ever greater," explains the artist and explains that "Flamenco-People" could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, actors or performers on the scene.
These people painted "on the street" are "artists able to transmit passion, sadness, joy when they're on stage ... and capture the public.
In order to take on the personality of these great men, they do not need to be depicted in a scene,
because their personality and character are inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the flamenco's sizes."
With the passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer started a long way in 1997 to draw singers, guitarists or dancers using a camera.
They are photographed that, due to the type of machine and material, they remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the picture of modernity, according to an idea reflecting the design of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or singing in itself, but the artist's personality, his character, is able to win the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way to feel and be, have been and have been the constant of this work, exposed in these days at the El Fotomate Gallery.
Famous flamenco artists like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of the flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the photographs displayed on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for photos led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTProject".
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer agrees "I like to look at people, know them and can enter them for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the picture is the most difficult type in photography.
You meet or meet people, people who sometimes don't even know you or who give you just a few minutes to take out the photo.
In addition to these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concrete my ideas."
The collection of pictures of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotomata gallery, at number 20 of road de la Mata, parallel to road Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa realizes that the novel he's writing is an "azardo"
It's environment in places that still do not know and it's about unknown issues: Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is in business with a new project he's working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casamant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for 20 years and has crossed the Amazon.
Since always in favor of the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer has confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project of which you are working today "is an azard" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't have written it, but I will do it as well and I hope to finish it as before," he concluded his event at the festival for exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that have been seen for four days in the city of Acquedotto by hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "La Ciudad y los perros" was, as a proviso, the figure of mark at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of Hay Festival to be the most voted writer – an ancient edition of the book "Our mutual friend" of Dickens, filled the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer was in front of a audience where the time was spent when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, referred to how he was born in him as the "extraordinary adventure" of "reading" and "living beyond what I was living"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement "the lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous recovery; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, he acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an effimeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has its effects" and that "makes the most anti-conformist people." That is why he invited the writers to "don't give up" and "take responsibility" for their vocation.
The time stops the Pozoblanco Festival, preventing it from running
The festival of the corridors that should have suggested the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning after the towers selected for the corridors had verified that the conditions on the ground of the square were not suitable.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The Temperies were attacked against this Festival, preventing two days from celebrating on three days.
Saturday, the plague prevented the second race of torso.
In the cartels were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced a tower of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the festival had to be held on Friday only.
On this occasion Daniel Luque was to trionphare, cutting three ears and being brought out into trionfo, after having torpedo with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavanante finished his two races risking health and hearing, granted more by the public than due to the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the arena of Los Llanos with no glory and no pain.
With the second bull, after a trimmering mullet, fish were obtained from most of the public.
A van with two thousand quills of hashish over the block place in Alava
Less than ten in the morning.
The agents aim at two employees of a van who, instead of stopping, run away.
The agents have threatened the height of two employees of a van who, instead of stopping, have fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After following them, the agents were able to arrest one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., as reported in the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government's communication.
The person arrested is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some of Alava's road officials were carrying out a control of transport on N-1, in which it was carried out through the Circus of Arminón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, crossing the order, hurriedly and passed the block.
The agents were followed up until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the road and its two crew members fled into a forest area.
The Erzzaintza agents were thus able to arrest one of the fugitives and chase the 2,178 kilograms of hashish that were transported and took action once the van was inspected, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a deep investigation and detection of the weight.
Moreover, since the officials have found that the matrix has been "doubled" since it did not match that reported in the customs documentation, the refusal of falsification of public documents has also been imposed on the arrest.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the kidnapped drug.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. has been led to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and to be available to the court within the next hours.
Arrest the Heather Locklear actress for driving under the drug effect
The actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the drug effect.
A Witness saw her run dangerous manoeuvres while trying to get out with the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the People magazine by a truck driver from the California street.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "was driving the accelerator deeply, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with manoeuvres forward and back. Making a return trip, he passed over to his eyes from the sun."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear was stopped on a nearby road and was out of the vehicle.
This person was warning emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It seemed confused," and for this reason the agents led it to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit it to a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has demonstrated cooperatively and the hypotheses of alcohol abuse has been eliminated since the beginning, even though "as observed by officials at the first moment, we believe Locklear was under the influence of a few drugs."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of conduct under the effect of some non-expected substance and was imprisoned in the local prison about 19 p.m. to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an anxiety and depression episode.
Llamazares calls for the U.S. Andalusian Federation to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The director-general of the UI and member of the party Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that he will expect the regional training federation to take a decision on the case of former advisors to the Young People's and Sport of the City of Sivglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, who assigned the resignations last week following the charge of customerism.
"In these cases, they are particularly federalists, and it will be the organisation that has to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said as regards the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has so far been an adviser to the Civil Council.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have done. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have the highest transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public tasks."
"Sangre de May", Garci's epic poem
In inspiration to the Nationales episode of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposed in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish revolution against the French, in which it is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost EUR 15 million budget.
With this film, the director has tried "to illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time social analysis" which has always admired the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Kim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría as head of a wide range of actors.
Bloode de Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in cinema halls, to become a television minister for more than four hours in the future on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have made this round "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must be grateful to Esperanza Aguirre, who was commissioned by the Community of Madrid three years before he was filmed for the second century of May 2. The register had agreed on a covenant that the history of the Romans was based on Episodios Nationales.
The 15 million budgets allocated throughout the Madrid Community represented Garci a "one chance" to re-establish the proper schedules and customs to reflect a "an angry Spanish who has made the choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII" observed Garci.
However, the register noted that he had not received funding similar to those of Alatriste or Los Fantasmas de Goya - more than twice compared to Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some scenes from the script that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a co-laborator of almost all his career.
This, for the Volver registry to start, influenced what is its practice of regular work, the stage with actors, with which it is often used to try to turn around with those who will not be part of the castle, because it is considered to be "submissive," considering that "part of the work of the register lies in going to theater and cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which it works."
Many of the performers, some of whom come back to the Sangre de Mayo castle, try to face their car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
A candidate for Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Bloode de Mayo, His Seven Masses de billar francés and, the last one selected Los Girisoles siegos - do not represent the younger generation of the Spanish film "which should rather be known."
This movie Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for the back, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you're just going to turn a movie into more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon discovered the civil essence of the Ballerina Tortola Valencia
A city ballerina makes fun of another ballerina just like Sivglia.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, a Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusa mother (Georgia Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana district, and at the age of three she moved with the family in London.
He was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dance specialist.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female initiative, of the calibre of Isodora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who opposed a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa and she's offering me this character.
It supports the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The title of his dances suggested some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the maripo" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some Tanghi.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing was also in this aesthetic," she explains.
The scene has two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his performances, as he does in "The Open Door"; and that of Master Matilda Coral, who extremely wanted to work with what was an ally.
"Matilde interprets Tortola from adults, the character of maturity.
I'm glad you agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The anthem also includes musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "which plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been all over, and who have always had many spacers."
The work is also in some ways the life of this woman who lives far away, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she's one of the women who have had a huge influence in a historical period and now no one remembers her and so much less considers her work as something of value," says Bayon.
The show will begin today, at 20.30 p.m. at Lope de Vega's theater.
With the publication of the "Diario de en poeta recién casado" the Trienno is also closed.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de en Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusia Günta to celebrate the "Thirennia di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Thirence of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the revision of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Chopo de luz", which was opened last May and that, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, it will be expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Andalusian Culture Advisorate obtained a total of eight hundred copies of "Diario de en Poeta Reciencasado", by Peter Taberero and by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who I'll work with him in "Auscia de malicia" and give the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the disturbing idea that Newman would have gone.
But it cost him a lot to get him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he's been in retirement.
And she also knew she was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and I now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or excessive.
He died a father of cinema and patriotism at a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on earth, in desperate search of new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men are so brave and they remain very good people to admire, it doesn't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, I was enthralled by the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and twenty causes, from the foundation for the fight against drug created in honor of the first death of overdoses to the creation of the domestic and biological food brand.
All donations to a country where it is very expensive to go beyond a self-sustained food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without healing either from nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, noticed that a man didn't die, a time has passed.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, a prized director with Oscar, said working with Newman was nothing less than the ambition of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was forced to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He left a high-level example for all of us," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in mind the need for justice and having a serious and far-reaching private life.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some are testing us and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful but who certainly did not miss out on opportunities for not being.
"Why am I going out of Hamburg today, if I have a drink at home?" he smiled.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, non-callee and loving philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect course of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or after the Olympics will land in Madrid and, after the 2012 attempt failed, this could happen in 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's course, I'll just say no!
They called him "the perfect race," but I think the worst thing I've ever seen was a long time ago.
A lot of shortcomings, which would then be taken into account in the assessment act and I should have examined them, would have been absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The shocks began with the removal of the dorsal, which assumed it would go first.
It didn't look like a wrong idea, but if you're forced to go, it's just to pull everything off (I'm stuck with the chip to avoid codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go just to take the dorsal (first dryness, only for this) and (after the corresponding code), surprised! they had only smooth only 'S' size (second dryness because I need a XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it a crime of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small butter made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are starting with the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon to take the chip, the waiting code was 15 minutes and for more, you had to deposit the soap.
The waiting period is longer than 35 minutes, which is impossible for a course where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was expected, the course was started that we had not even deposited the garden, although once successful in the company, recovery was even worse.
In addition, the plague threatened the waiting for more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and aggression were added.
At least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct order due to the chip that, I guess, did not properly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect course, this will certainly not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of carrying out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a navigation service to move within the company's campus) helping the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a form recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand key words in a conversation with them.
You can also group those in chat groups.
In the video for example, the receptionist identifies a third person, but he understands that it is not part of the group he is talking to and that he is not a company's employee.
She asks if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be there soon.
All without blue screen.
That's impressive.
But this is, of course, the future.
Now the company has better focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier to read and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has found that if computers had essential functions and less commercial space, they would be five times faster – hey! Steve will be "less".
All one discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is welcome.
Microsoft has reason: the operating system is becoming more and more important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that Google was the first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and communication software.
You play the same role as your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your stepmother.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but it may be necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Balmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only used to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we spend more time on the network every day than in a remote window environment.
What do half of the operating system's applications serve?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make it a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I'm going to give you a little example here.
I threw the photo in this post into one of the resorts for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the bottle machine a folder asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a network search.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if it does not apply in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it in the coast of Azzurra, Leonardo di Caprio reflected in Edward Zwick's 'Diacante de Blood', as well as Al Pacino in the 'Il Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola in addition to being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscle parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of stars, we can recall the image of the force with the pointed buffs that lift the weights in the ambulance circle.
It is, in substance, of the typical man-made makeup, with the inside of cotton, attenuated and without handles.
It's the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel spits on everyone.
The "Marcel" is superior to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive tone and for the small Belgian flag (recognitionable) which the most emblematic models of the
The "Marcel" is superior to the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive tone and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable) that the most emblematic yellow models carry as details on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian diet is not just about the famous "tank".
Includes flags for college, retro boxer, cassette cardigan, cotton pants, seagulls, baby-dolls, mini short...
Close garments thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as intimate whitemail.
I'm too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't care"
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new activity seriously in the field of fashion.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and celebrity who give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango had made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes than the Spanish fashion house sponsorship.
Hot and scared, you win fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have thought about for Mango's autumn winter season, as well as for the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango take place in this fourth working season for the Spanish home?
Both my sister and I like the movie of the '50s and '60s, we got a lot of inspiration from here.
Then I love to lose myself in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do so often.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, even though it is finally confusing and there are many elements in common.
I had always liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to feed my aunt's arms and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better than going to the game park.
Then, once in a while, I've always paid a lot of attention to dress.
You know, the dancers like to have their own style to go to school and to the wise, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of the actress, when they deliver you the watch is the moment you really meet the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with great respect for the stylists and professionals.
Not long ago, you were 30 years old, you got into a crisis?
But don't.
I feel better. I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience in saving lives by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since childhood and this has brought me much inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she asks me for my own body and I also want to be a young mother, which I don't want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I'm going to do will be very happy for my son and educate him with great love.
As far as the film is concerned, you're waiting to be in the different rooms some movies you've come back last year.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very patient and worried, I want everything right now and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the tomb of Christ".
We'll see if you like it.
A few days ago you started on the passerella with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was in the past like a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I know for a long time, has called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we showed – I took two parts of our collection for Mango – were put on the beach to collect funds for this Naomi's NGO.
People don't know this side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I know you for a long time I can assure you that they are not so true.
In addition, I find this good part of which you are involved.
He asked me to scream for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the painting, I would have done it the same way.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't go back.
Alcoholic drivers will have to install "alcoholick"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive alcohol consumption in the blood to install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in the state of ivy or if it does not fit in the device.
The measure was announced last June and it is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor of the State, which will be a pilot project of one year's duration.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this should take a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Road Safety General, they will participate in the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving in a state of blindness then drive the car again.
Alcohol would avoid it, because it is a vehicle-related system measuring the rate of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents driving the car if the driver is not sufficient, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that authorised.
The cost is higher than EUR 1000 and would be to be the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the motor vehicles of these devices allow for a reduction of up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people's lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to refrain from these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And in order to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be done on an ordinary basis, and, of course, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
In the morning itself, the Congress of Members will vote in favour of the PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system in schools' buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With a British point of view, at 17.40, according to the programme, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturias were travelling landed at the presidential airport of Benito Juárez of Mexico City.
The sun was moving, but the rays were still forced to use their hands as a vision to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the feet of the skeleton, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours ago I asked a taxi driver for the road if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who are waiting at the airport for the red carpet and military cordon consisting of 27 marine soldiers who offer the salute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very drunk, doesn't use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they referred to her that in Mexico City was seriously threatening time.
They give the photographers a smile and a short pause before passing into the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the hotel's door where they live, one of the four largest cities, a spiritist reporter awaits them from Mexican television.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the most suitable world to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and probably there is no smarter stylelist and good live by Valentino.
Mango recently presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote international promotion of new talents in the fashion field.
It offers a $300,000 prize.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched her drawings in Mango wine at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from emotion.
In addition, it is the second largest retail store in Europe and it has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to please the Valentino stylist who presided over the competition jury, started with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's most skilful TV table, the front table of gala prepared by Mango, it was even more spectacular.
Born with the heart in front and making it necessary virtuous, because of the recent death of the brother, she dressed a house suit and some supplements of ELAH to remove the fiat and the arm of the son Luis - a boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the front of the cooking dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, has done the house and horse honor that he has finished, along with Barone Rotchil, without a jacket, because both of them had thrown them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – transformed into a dinner, dressed in a long black suit very sexy and excited during the night's walk accompanied by Goya Toledo within the work, when they showed us the room for ballet wisdom and she, remembering other times, wore a bar and painted a "great blue".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the places of the palace, but he showed us his son's photos on the cell.
The next day we were delighted with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moved on the bike - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his canvasses, and was assured in advance that there were no rain in his room.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, it's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And as if this wasn't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring the rest in the libraries on September 30.
The wake is almost a punishment every morning at 7:00 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the phrenetic rhythm recorded by modern life.
The office is called tension and the wrong computer.
Stress is the worst of the 21st century.
However, there is no one and no two methods of combating everyday abuse and the fact that it is difficult to escape from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Alongside the yoga positions, classic massage or "spa", Susannah Marriott collects on the pages of his book, a "menu" of options for everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calmness will reach the libraries thanks to editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to win peace in areas such as working or personal relationships, this "manual" forgets this conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as contacting nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs into your veins to find the balance of the body and stress is a problem, it's time to sit on the sofa, relax your mind and concentrate on reading.
Speak in sound
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who speak remain asleep.
The first time it happens, at least one alarm is taken, but it doesn't really matter much.
This is a positive change in the defined dreaming.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Most of you must have told me that you were talking in the dream.
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (one time in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as incubation, night fear, night sweats (to make sleep pipe), or sleepnambulism, but not necessarily so.
As previously mentioned, it can be associated with very high fever rates, stressful situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it's a phenomenon still not studied.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a tone of voice very quiet, with words swirling, almost in a surrogate or that the opposite occurs (hours, cries, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and, if possible, consult a specialist to see if there are any issues that are causing an abnormal state of concern as a result of the situation.
We said that this is a positive change, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if associated with insomnia or stress).
What you can do, however, is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the child before he goes to bed.
Proposed quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that provoke fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
Once the bellows appear to try to keep the calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the day after that will not remember any of what happened.
Practical advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's not aware of what's going on, and you've stopped him from dreaming.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping and so she's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check from where it is caused by such intense concern in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to ask him for information.
You won't get anything, because he's asleep and so he's not conscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, why you need to pay much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that these might lead to.
Never tell the child you can ask questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for fun.
A kind of thing causes a huge anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illausern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the road to home victory after a long fruitful period.
Without playing an awesome game, the Gallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities transforming one into the victory of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting in which attackers were expressed in fact.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who fired the seven with a long shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of Dannemarie, Funderflick away, then Hirn high, Roman at point and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block at the center of the camp, leaving only the Castent Rihai at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial times signed by Rihai and Temporal for Denmark, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well placed, took a backdrop on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But Illhaeusern's cannonaire will not be able to achieve his long-term happiness and will be expelled for a dozen minutes after leaving his team members with a numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to the Illhaeusern Unions, which was only sent to "enforce" the defense, except in the last few minutes of the game when, after a rockambolesca action, the ball pushed through.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in collera
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
In addition to the demonstration of fishermen who have violently prevented access to various Breton and Normnon ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to return to the port of Guilvinec in the department of Finistère in order to encourage the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "be present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time with the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to meet the fuel price commitment, which has reached its record with an average of more than EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to Eliso David Martin's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and ensure the working conditions and pay for marines".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumacus operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections with Belle-Isle have not been interrupted.
A road block was implemented on the peninsula of Quiberon.
On Monday the mariners have already proved their determination by burning, from the wood, pneumatics and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking their stand for demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to the ports of the Atlantic coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fish remained on the shore, or in Havre, where a fleet of vessels prevented the movement of ships from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near Loira Atlantic, interrupted in the evening the blockade of Donges' Total Refinery Note.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and possible participation in the meeting planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support the movement.
"I'll keep it" because "fishers won't drop" and "they don't intend to move to Paris," he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the yield limit of a stock is only reached with a gas less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy" performer died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and yet Sam Mendes have saluted the legend of the film and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year 215, despite the threats of recession recorded on the world economy, the aircraft builder company delivers it.
Embraer, the fourth world company in the sector, maintains the delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivery, confirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, he got 97 planes.
The Brazilian company is widely trusted in the Chinese market, in particular for the range air between 30 and 120 seats.
To this day, Embraer delivered 41 air to Chinese customers at eight years of age.
AIG would pay more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which was reimbursed by the American monetary authorities, would pay more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the future loan of $85 billion, according to the financial Times Sunday edition.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the allocation of life insurance frameworks to the international market and the United States, needs the paper on the basis of more than self-reliance.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Thursday evening to review any allocations, according to the FT.
No confirmation was received to the AIG.
The activities the AIG intends to assign include the International Lease Financial Corp., its share equal to 59% of Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No definitive decision has been taken on these concessions, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion allowances from the Federal Reserve, in order to see the US authorities pay 80% of their capital.
Paris: Chronist of Morning Meeting
New York's Borsa accused a historic plot on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against Paulson's plan for saving the financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. an invisible drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is completed at 10,365,45, under 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst losses in its history (684.81 points) are higher than those on 17 September 2001, on the day of the reopening of the Borse following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Nasdaq, the main technological titles index, lost 199.61 points close to 1,983, and the standard & Poor's 500 extended index lost 8,81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing to 1,106,55, with final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of its session, Wall Street is deeply affected after the unexpected rejection of the bank’s rescue plan, which is intended to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans on three refused the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates how the market counts on the project," he added, fearing that within a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project was actually dying... then the witness would pass quickly to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the US central bank, etc) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of the financial and economic sector at Global Insight.
And while it still highlights the state of emergency," every day leading to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the fall of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organised the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by the rival City Group.
In Europe, the crisis has rapidly accelerated, calling for emergency intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets "are not only faced with an American crisis but a global crisis" has added the financial FTN analyst.
The compulsory market is very high.
The income of the Treasuren Goods at 10 years is reduced to 3,632%, against 3,827% on Friday evening, while that with 30 years at 4,161%, against 4,357% of the previous day.
Obama in favour of the first TV double
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, it takes a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republican and democratic campaign have announced their victory over television theft, followed by a third of the American families.
Politician David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, has not been bright enough to allow him to slow down in five weeks' investigations by the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, of which a survey of published opinions on Saturday provides a five-point advantage in Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the democratic has had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on an independent election sample revealed that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with the rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has a good idea," however, warned Bill Clinton this week-end.
Captain McCain has never failed to promote his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "individuality" of the opponent regarding the arguments faced during the first face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." He often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills necessary to become president," he said.
What has been a constant reading of the Republican TV campaign since yesterday.
Obama, from his side, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it has been shown to be sensible and precise.
It has promoted its preposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the global scene.
"McCain has never understood, unlike Obama," he replied, this weekend, a democratic spot, rehearsing to the Republican that he had not taken the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the nine minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a battleground, for an election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "media class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the threshold of precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive turn," he thought yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's view of economic matters to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current round "is the final green after eight years of poor economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's assumptions, the Senator of Illinois has also mentioned among its priorities the achievement of any energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, on his side, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Carefully, the two candidates filed applications focused on the financial savings plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday at the Congress and extremely popular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents appeared on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to question the results of the legislation in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after the closure of the electoral tracks in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still expected, many young people came to express their opposition to President Alexander Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, the resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "To what purpose? They will do what they want from my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a beautiful figure for foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been separated from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to take part in the voting process," Iuri Potemkine, a representative of the Union of the Democratic Forces, lamented.
"It is a change of face, underscoring Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidentials and capofila of the pro-European movement, as it is important who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can include a television area, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition has therefore had to enter the political game because "it is necessary to start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily due to Russia, is in crisis, and we will not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe which has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the scrutiny.
It underlines that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has given way to all types of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Asks social-democratic leader Alexander Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one on the electoral stations.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those most in favour of power."
The night's silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are competing for their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his President, Dott.sa FrancineDécary, had all the reasons for rejoicing, since Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he regained public confidence, seriously cut off from the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been infected by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a drama and with the protests of the population, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation , directed by Judge Horace Krever , which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the prosecution of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in writing a report, some provinces have set up a committee with the aim of setting up a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Québec and the Canadian Society of Blood (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of the people declared that they still had confidence in the system of donations in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood transfusions and field research over the years that followed, we regained public confidence," he explained, before he said proud that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dott.sa Décary is convinced that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases in Europe of the human variant of the poor peace, a new demonstration of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's molluscs, which has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't really know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, which states that when there are doubts and may be serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s cancer, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, are adopted by exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us so that it makes sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for HIV identification appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that allow donor blood directly to recognize the presence of the virus and not antibodies against it, on which tests were based instead of those used so far.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. since the person contracted the disease to what the first viruses can be identified in blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS with blood transfusions.
Today, a person over 12 million is at risk of receiving blood from HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by the HIV virus.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs.
I believe that today we can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of Hema-Québec's management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You don't know what pathogen is going to get into the system.
Not later than a year later, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by an insect.
Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient attention to the need for constant vigilance" continues Dr. Ssa Décary prior to stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide them.
"The needs increase because the elderly population.
Because of the most aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or pancreas.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors who, on average, constitute only 3% of Quebec's eligible population as donors."
However, all healthy people who have completed 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are infected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is disseminated, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can keep an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The cases of penicillin are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors who are elderly and unable to make donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to treat and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so freaky that it's hard to give blood an hour," says disappointed Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, of which bonebrains, eyecardial valves and skin are used almost exclusively for severe wear.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
In the bone marrow, once considered a biomedicine deficiency, there is enough blood of stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the entry into the bank of our finest blood sample of cordon and we plan to take it more than a thousand years ago.
You should start proposing them for prisoners at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Ssa Décary, who describes this practice of blood transfusion of cordon blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are tired of having no access to you," as Hema-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this comprehensive and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Calcio - The Semifinal Impact
The Impact Montréal has been qualified for the semifinal of the A series eliminaters, winning 3-1 against the Seeders of Seattle yesterday, during a second decisive game of the final quarter, at the Saputo Stadium.
Central champion Antonio Ribeiro has signed the decisive goal at the '90s.
After a first time without goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino have identified the following networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levescu was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We recall that on the first day of the return party, Friday, the Impact had immediately a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle perimeter.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinals.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thungler hit the first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still take part in the semifinal.
The Impact will have to deal with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed every day.
In short - Kovalev’s decisive network
The Canadians and their assets are ready to resume the season.
The third format by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanetec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the offensive stage of game winning 3-2 against Panthers, Florida, yesterday night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, took two steps, and collected a pass for the victory, in the room of Hab's preparatory games.
He decided to win the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel at my action."
"He tried to punish in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There's been a beautiful ovation."
Charest Point to North
The prime minister does not exclude the start of the elections before the end of the year.
In conclusion, the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest took place yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to make himself elected on the occasion of today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the borders of our last large northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis by means of instruments from a strong visual impact, in the case of the general council of the Quebec Free Party.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino in images".
On three max screens, negative displays of hydroelectric fingers, mineral cultivations, pictures of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", cartons, etc.
Large means such as full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, however, the prime minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very committed.
The "North Piano" is the fourth point of a "project" which the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on manoeuvre, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speech by the Prime Minister, the opening of the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister was limited in explaining that the North would be "a joy from the vast potential", but he did not speak about temporary or investment quotas, as he did not explain what the precise priorities for future projects would be.
More importantly, it has been limited to indicate what it considers to be a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced various improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Standing on the list styled by Charest, the North contains "Nichel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory is the double of France", it's here, it's Quebec.
It's not just here, but it's stuck in us," he insisted, as he wanted to call for a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the February gold in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"Looks at us, it's our future," he added, after a theatre break to see the huge picture on his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador which Quebec has always claimed, has specified the first minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I will resume that position on behalf of the government," he said.
The rest," considering climate change, has to reassess the North," he said about the North-West transition, which will be open for all year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that the occupation of the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet with their interests, especially those of the young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-president of the United States PQ), have already taken the lead in consultation with one-third of the community.
A inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and where Julie Boulet (Natural Transport and Resources) has taken on an important role, has started work.
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting,"not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions" will be provided.
The development of the North would be a threat to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Piano will be "contested, ordered and respected the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuation of that of the former liberal ministers.
"As the liberals who have been before us, we know how to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the topics of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the top of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-establish the Beauharnois Centrale in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, founder of Hydro-Québec, in Lesage who nationalised hydroelectricity in Bourassa, founder of the Bay James, our party has always known the future," Jean Charest said.
During the press conference, another reference was made, conserving this time, John Diefenbaker's "Strade towards the North" programme, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
Faced with the project on Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydroelectric diege, Charest stated that its operation would be planned for 2012.
"All this is left between us, but I feel we'll do it," confessed his soldiers, raising applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who claimed that in April there would have been no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not lose the opportunity to launch an autumn survey, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he must be very committed, in particular in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council at the end of the week provided the Liberal Capophile with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular "constitutional aspirations" which have been left behind as oil: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It is also hoped that Quebec will have the names of the members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that the latter have a right to vote on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as opposition is concerned, the draft North Piano has been adopted in a sceptical way.
PQ leader Pauline Marois responded to the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done it, "we would have progressed today" commented Marois in front of Jean-Talon's candidate, Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of the North Piano by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not just perceived as a show," commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, back today from the holidays.
Letter - An unrolled country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice of Harper's Office, to allow him to state that the past summer, that Louise Arbor was a "dignity" for Canada.
Disrespecting this way a woman who has fought inextricably for justice and who deserves all our admiration says much both about the prime minister's entoourage and about Stephen Harper himself.
It is a matter of concern to a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not returned one of its citizens to the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that has nothing to do with the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time when the imputable facts took place.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, has withdrawn its word and lets a child soldier be marked under human conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, as an informant, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Order, in particular, call for Omar Khadraffin's return to be submitted to a regular process in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of interns to torture: it does not matter how little a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after many years of sobriety.
There is no account yet, but we are witnessing an indiscriminate erosion of our rights, freedom and "democraticness", a word that Harper does not stop and that sounds so insensitive to his lips.
Here we come at a time when there is no moral basis: we can deal with, torture, arbitrary imprisonment of a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today minority (to see what will happen after 14 October...).
A number of voters believe that a party preaching the Virtue, respect for the Law and Order represent salvation: they do not see that this government has abandoned what is the reputation and dignity of our country.
You're right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and on no other side.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech of the Barrick Gold
In the September 17th edition, Le Debor published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, this last statement that the world's largest bidder company has carried out a quest for diffamation by six million against three authors and a small flat-rate publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a plea for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
As for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to destruction by anyone who is willing to support a position contrary to it.
Little does matter the outcome of the process, the authors and the editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a considerable amount of money in order to organize their defence and fight against an army of lawyers funded by practically no-one of the mining company.
For the rest, in these wars with learned weapons, the tactic is often the one to break the agreement in order to impose a consensus regulation which would lead to opposition and to fear anyone who wishes to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would be contrary to the public opinion that he should have presented his own view of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where the Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates are usually conducted with exchange of views and not with manganese attacks.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, documents, and establish a true and just debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of an independent research team that could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in public opinion, and he misappropriates his petitions and letters in support of the authors of Canada Black.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public debate" when his hatred for the same public is obvious?
In the vice-president world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to those who are profusely paid and not to all Canadians; this is a rather limited vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even demigrators have the right to speak.
What the Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does it first because it refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinions, and not in the light of what many consider to be a sort of impasse (researching for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given Canadian authors a ultimateum in order to stop using that word...)
In addition to the Garver's surreal speech, the wish to play by the Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, which is indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to refer to authentic sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss controversial issues with the world’s richest businesses, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards of the authors of Canada Black.
He's got the right to repeat.
For a long time, the university environment, which we are part of, is able to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of the Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its assumptions, it is not looking for a transparent debate.
This goes beyond the university world, as is the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments are taking measures to limit abuse.
Operation – Save for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and Congress Capofillas, representatives of the republican and democratic segregation, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest saving-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that lasts months on Wall Street, is still to be ratified by the two Congressrooms.
In particular, it provides: checks on its effective implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the return of public money, new provisions to contain the number of cases covered by missing payments, as well as a right of inspection on the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected undertakings.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the treaty, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to protect the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street."
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted this way, estimable discomforts and disturbances would have turned around the Americans' daily life," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit granted corresponds to the opening of the markets this morning.
Later joined by the Treaty, the two candidates to the US Presidency were shown to be more favourable to the agreement, however, not to express their disappointment at the adoption of extreme solutions.
The democratic Senator Barack Obama is entitled to add some provisions to the agreement, in particular what will enable owners to maintain their own home and income for the remuneration of the heads of undertakings covered by the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of others, there is nothing to be done.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he will vote in favour of the plan, his opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to examine the details, but I hope so."
"As I read it, it's something that we all have to dig and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to recover with the taxpayer's money from the US financial institutions' ventures, risk assets and payables.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the purpose of an real estate ball that has led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (mutu ) , then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and focus on the freezing of liquidity and bank and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of sending the first draft agreement to the air last week.
It seems to be out of that blind village since the democracies have accepted that the "toxic" asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet all, at the Congress, a provision was added which, if the government had to deal with losses over the next five years because of this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion dollars which may be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The 350 billion budget should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected companies that will steal dividends in case of profit and that can be recovered when the waters are calmed.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the payment procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and leave payments paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
From now on, the architects of the plan would like to vote in the House of Representatives, and in the vote of the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the path is open to their plan.
In fact, there have been several votes against the project yesterday, both at the public and democratic level.
"Of course, Washington doesn't feel you," said Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, speaking out against his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But I'm not sure to take advantage of the contributors.
Leader of a small group at the so-called "the caucus of the sceptics", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but reaches the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economic teachers, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw the wrong conclusions and to carefully examine how to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was another test of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would have given up on the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of ventured real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of Europe's largest banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not about money lost, the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, influence and voting rights are at risk in banking matters.
It's certainly something that rescuers and families appreciate now that times are not certain"
During this period, at the other end of Manica, the British Government seems to be in a position to nationalise another bank in bill for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would be charged with the total current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion dollars (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be her to buy the subsidiaries and accounts from the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, to take up a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time his ass in his hand, for others his weak point.
You were released from the Narcissistic Spectator, the American actor from the amplifier smile?
Yeah, it's not.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would have driven him out of that circle of powers dedicated to the true and sacred samples.
But what a cost!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his joint of Connecticut, following a lung cancer, remains one of the last signs of American film of the past years.
Less monumental of Brando, to whom he seemed to be a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also responsible for the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
In mixed couples, magical children are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, by a German Hebrew father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots, one of the most glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last brand of quality.
Because he recognized the whole country of the safe made-up man, the fighter of the Pacific war, proud in the fight, that at the beginning of the 50s he studied dramatic art in Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio of New York, before he played at the theater, on television and soon at the cinema.
The same military man for civil rights was also the automobile pilot who was classified according to 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a couple's model since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
If they go with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully discover the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a blow to the hearts of the filmmakers, while his great characters popularize the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in complete transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy (1969) and that girl unable to wish for the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La gattat on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember this in the panics of the sensitive Mr Bridge (1990), upset by a marriage that did not keep as much as I had promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Lassú someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean and recovered after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That poor sympathy in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
Player of beloved and selling billiard in Los Spaccone, great film by Robert Rossen (1961), The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which was his only Oscar in 1987 on 9 nominations.
That view over the years was his.
He's still here.
The seasons occur through its course.
Young people know him especially for the film Slap Shot-Colpo dry George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, the founder of a little orthodox hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as father of the Irish mafia in Ere my father in 2003.
Unlike the most lightest grades of the film they left shortly after the show, Newman will stay long in the halls, accusing Hollywood of his entire end, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with an irony point, "a living challenge at underplaying", judging its performances too much.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, where roles seemed to fall like manna from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholics, or desperate, of whom he expressed deviation and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown impressions of his true, podium sensitivity.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the role of the protagonist, followed a subtle female portrait of melanconia.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdo, dedicated his 1984 film to Harry and Son, a blind and sad movie.
Among the countless worst nightmares of Newman yesterday, his great friend and former army mate Robert Redford (they had quoted together in La Stanita and Butch Cassidy) said with endless sadness "His presence has made my life and this better country".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the lost actor.
On the other side of a career of legend, there is such a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood heritage.
We would have surprised her face to express on bottles of oil, salts, biscuits and other foods, judging her as a choice of bad taste, although she was born like a gay.
However, the revenues of those sales were intended for its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, rather than clinging to his myth, hesitates to commit to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters that said "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly familiar with his good star.
Be that as it may be, it was a privilege."
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist so clean and generous.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What has been produced in the factory of Zuschlag invoices & partners?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings will be discussed against János Zuschlag and his companions.
The political man and his partners are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed under a criminal association which has caused significant damage, and other offences, including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Search, the money received from competition bands was used for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million flowers, has been completed partly in the Fiatal Balldal event, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, known by the investigating authorities, they have taken the money received from competition bands on the basis of invoices for non-existing transactions and associations have never complied with their obligations.
According to the prosecutor's act, most of the invoices were false.
In order to do so, invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And in order to decide on whose name it says to issue the invoices, it was established between the other during the guitar between the hills above Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these, the invoices were prepared to be added to the competition bands, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Community of Budapest.
Most of these are the works of István Lados and András Óri, which, according to our information, has prepared, above all, the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of Lados' "travel study" choices was an office.
According to two figures issued by Zuschlag and its partners in 2003, the restaurant provided food for a group of 90 members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant says, would not all enter the place together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jötőrt Foundation, then called Együtt in Harmadik Évezredtért, is a form error and content parcel.
One Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not afford to stay overnight, but the invoice included 130 guests.
But the compilations of the facts filled with fantasy have gone too far when they reported the Pigal Kft., this is also a restaurant where accounting - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even include documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jötőrt and Hoppaá.
Győző Farkas, company administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was called in search of facts, he immediately realized that it was false documents.
"On my grave the name and the Iva game of our company were found at a wrong point."
He added: In addition to formal reasons, there was no return to the fact that hundreds of people, according to the bill, were accommodated when there were eleven rooms in total and there are not so many places to sleep.
After all, the invoice was of restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in use for a long time.
Asid invoicellers are not concerned about informing themselves that Budapest's travel agency from their choice, organises only travel abroad, so they have reported shockingly on the invoice with payment in travel accounts in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as shown during the investigation, the invoice also included Iva, while travel activity outside the European Union is absent Iva.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfüllöp Kft. in favour of the foundation Jobb Jößérét, while the services offered by the company needed to apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, the hotel's employees also issued only printed invoices, while the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, "emissioners" have damaged other factors, in the case of a die, they have indicated how the goods were transported on the road, as shown by the search procedure, activities which were not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition to formal defects - due to non-conformity invoice format, false stamp - it has been found that invoices issued in favour of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredett Alapitvány, of XXI. Sázazadi Culturalis Egyesülett and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Konfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that Nyiregyháza HIB Kft was in liquidation when (2001) had a group of Fiatal Városét Egyesület, which, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They issued invoices consciously
Another group of invoice issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapesttér Alapitvány Foundation has issued an invoice on the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifjü Socialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of nearly 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the prosecutor's act, persuaded the director of the Collab Kft. to issue fictional facts.
He co-operated with Zuschlag and his partners also the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices for about 5 million flowers to the Jobb Jötőrt Alapitvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület Association and Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, where there was no real economic activity.
No money movement because the invoices were then returned, but the associations forgot to make this aspect appear in their documents.
In the next group of invoices, those who are connected with the invoices are included.
Ad. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to recapture the director general of Delta Trió Kft, with headquarters in Budapest but not available there, which deals with fuel and car sales.
The diet released several invoices in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of information media for a value of about 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Ltd. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since September 14, 2005, bought these invoices.
The director general of this diet was a Romanian who would have published documents on the diet between 2002 and 2005 by Ivan Kubatov.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had released invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredett Alapitvány and the opponent was taken by him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian wallers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt.
But actually none of the diets were operational, because under the tax they had not received work.
However, the companies are benefiting because, at the request of Zsolt Szente, editor of company foundation documents, on behalf of the firms, invoices were issued to associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has released 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation is of the opinion that Kubatov has added 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as on Iva.
Man has also used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured by the Bzitos Pont competition band.
Y-Generation and Society in Modern Magyarországér in January 2006 presented a band for the public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 head flowers but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five fictional facts received from the Works Team Kft.
These figures were found during the search for the office of Árpád Kemexei at the Ministry of Public Education.
Some of the respondents, as they have already done in their search, will probably refer to the slowdown in the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the tax number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to raise the view over everything.
His confession has so far not been very detailed and although he has promised to speak more about everything in an extensive manner, he has not yet done so.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it could also be said that socialists have reached agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for 50 million flowers - would be willing to make the epithet.
Zuschlag could for now also have been offended because his requests for relief from his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of domestic arrests, have not yet been met.
While the authors of non-recoverable and highly harmful commercial offences can freely travel or at least wait at home for the end of the procedure against them, which he does not allow.
The psychology of tendering is too much: why spend more money?
The buyers are willing to spend more, overestimate the goods.
Researchers neurologists and economists of New York University have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study on the magazine Science, men do not want to stay behind in a competition such as the eBay beach, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research has sought to trace the nervous system of this "party" at the level of the nervous system through experimental axes.
One group of volunteers played the game, the other group of players participated in an asphalt while using the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the people involved in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the game of the ast, in which the essential element is to offer more than the other, the body stranded under the brain cortex goes into intensive function when losing the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "autogratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in price is explained by the scan of the vehement reaction of the strata body.
In order to support their theory, the economists of the research group have carried out a financial investigation.
In this case three groups have offered against a partner under different conditions.
They referred to the control group as to the actual value of the product concerned and made their point.
In addition to this, they promised that they would receive another $15 prize in the event of a win.
The third group would have received 15 dollars before the summer, but the members of the group would have lost money in case of loss of the summer.
The difference between the two groups was in the fact that for one of them the victory was emphasized, while for the other the loss was lost.
By checking the neurologists' assumptions, members of the group who played "against loss" were willing to score higher than the control group or "winner".
"These results are not deduced by any of the previously existing economic theories.
These facts have so far explained the phenomena that can be traced to the axes with the joy of winning and the avoidance of the risk.
Only the methods of creating neurological imagery have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have reached a third explanation," said Andrew Schutter, professor of the University of New York Economics.
Hepatitis: When do you turn to your doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, but among the first causes of death, chronic hepatitis is mentioned.
In Hungary the number of patients with hepatitis, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients cannot be infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious hepatitis caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and hepatitis, but their pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms according to the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sem, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to vaccination against viruses A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of infected foods accompanied by general illness, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After they form yellow spots on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the leaves become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two or three weeks.
A million people die every year from hepatitis B worldwide, the most serious variant of disease, which causes liver and liver surgeons.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one person in 10 receives a pharmacologic treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it may cause hepatitis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogen agents subdoally destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, toxic addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory examination reveals that the disease is worth referring to a family doctor when any symptoms of unknown origin are noted.
Recognized in time the disease is treatable, the virus can be eliminated by the organism, thus stopping the infectious power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to the viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a species of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The scientists at Oxford University have performed an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
In the course of the fair investigation, an electroshock was carried out with 12 Catholic believers and other atheists, while all who observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
On the basis of the results, Catholics were able to undo much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was found that Catholics were able to activate part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first of a series of research studies in which scientists, philosophers and theology of the University are also involved.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
Researchers have asked participants to concentrate on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Dama with Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary was a kind of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo’s frame was chosen because it was not too different from the other and held it as a soothing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this weather they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, observing or painting on a religious subject or the other.
The Catholics mentioned that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "sure", as if "some took care" of them and "they were calmed and troubled by peace".
Looking at the picture on a religious subject, they took into account 12% less pain than when Leonardo’s work was before them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has taken part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image from the strong effect even for the atheists, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We have to look for an image to which they convey very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English bishop Tom Wright competed with the research result.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a woman of Leonardo or another painter of such a calibre is presented to believers, what effect might it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You know what you're saying about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday Google can claim to be both in the pockets of people and in the sky above their heads; he knows where the holidays have taken place, as an ambulance, and what his interests are.
This, however, says Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the dictatorship, is not enough yet.
What is more about sceptics that make a comparison with the Orwellian incubator, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect more personal data from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders: "We enter into a system all the world's information!".
According to Google's director interviewed the dictatorship, after 10 years of revolutionary work, he is still able to manage all the information.
The question what will happen within five years Schmidt replied: He would like Google to know how to answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "what would the job be suitable for me?" but the software can't answer questions apparently simple because they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware that during their online searches, exact words are recorded, from which IP address are searched and from which page the interested ones are stopped after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users like e.g. can remember their browsing history, they can look at what they have searched and clicked, and they will long to generate results on a much better scale; this same logic is based on Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me, if they look at what I care about? - worried users are asked about Google data monopolies.
In most cases the contradictions of the insideers are caused by the fear shown by the size of the potential power represented by the finger, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or by the right to rebel against the power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in motivated cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases there is no defence of the personal rights of the internet.
The most exciting example of this has recently been perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has introduced to the Brazilian government information that has made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Google-based community of Orkut.
Interns concerned about personal rights, however, have dreamed of relief in May when the decree - in agreement with the EFF legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: neither can Google be forced by any point of constitution to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully deleted nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions obtained in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords related to two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data turn Google away because they believe that their intimate sphere and private life are being affected by the use of services and are led by the rebellion that awaits the multinationals who express themselves for the conservative image.
At the same time, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users in many countries see in them the future generation of big fingers, the "cool corporation", in contrast to their rivals, Microsoft liquidated as the world conqueror for Windows, as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept constantly up-to-date and the software package is much more accessible, young and cooler than the official software code.
But it can also happen because the geeks see the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which involves just one of the most frequently repeated key words in recent years, web 2.0.
The 2.0 web site speaks only of collaboration, to leave intensive traces behind us and to use the communication channels available to us and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles on more community pages, from Facebook to Yanga, you can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your musical tastes, all of which can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also post blogs about which their latest photo gallerys automatically appear on Flickr or Picasa.
So we read about a number of examples of which makes it clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken early in the morning by the common circle of friends, comes to know easily who spent the night with her loyal boyfriend or a finger can license a client because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life are able to show themselves and thus we can form the fundamental theme behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopolies can do so (e.g. starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time doesn't voluntarily leave traces).

However, critical observers around this find alarming points: the company's head for example has completely rejected the employee's protest after having doubled the company's right to asylum, held too costly the repeated daily restaurant to please the employees, but this is all due to the fact that in 2006 Google has China's head to the Chinese government and their agreement, Google will filter all the results that violate the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.

Two minors helped Ózd's double murder to wipe out the tracks
The police questioned two minors about Ózd's double murder, suspected of having helped to eliminate the traces of crime - the police questionnaire in Borsod region said Tuesday.
Young people have recognized the fact that they are being accused of being a favourary person.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the IMI, defend themselves on their own.
The benefit shall be punished up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was detained on Sunday.
It's suspected of premeditated homicide committed for profit.
The survey has shown that the 20th-year-old had a big debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason last Wednesday attracted his creditor to a church of Ozd where he and his nine-year-old daughter were killed.
According to information from the IMI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapons and circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Borsa di Warsaw has made an offer for the purchase of the Borsa di Prague
Warsaw's Borsa has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion blind crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the list of actions of the Borsa's Prague values.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Borsa of Warsaw, confirmed the offer made by Polish citizens despite the fact that the Borsa of Warsaw had previously been excluded as potential buyer of the Borsa of Prague.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Borsa di Warsaw is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in hand with the Polish state which intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial journal E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest number so far advanced for the Borsa di Prague.
According to the Czech press so far they have presented an offer to the Borsa di Vienna, the Transatlantic Borsa Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the Borsa di London and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Borsa values, said last week that the Warsaw Borsa would be the worst owner and did not forget that this could lead to the closure of the Borsa di Prague.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Borsa in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The main owner of the Borsa di Prague is the Patria Finance with a proportion of almost 25%, followed by the Bank Česká Sporítelna with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
Economic crisis from the perspective of European journals
The main European journals in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis are already talking about "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster was caused by the US President - accused The Republic - that it was not able to join its party behind an expeditious law, whose aim was to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
Also part of Madrid's print is seen in Washington as an expatriate head.
According to El Mondo, the lack of US political leadership has led to the global economy on the back of the boat.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing ever greater and will then be felt by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the Congress's vote, there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as capitalism's history is being transformed.
It is no longer possible to trace the threat - warns the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifeboat to the shipping financial institutions and the taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as a dominant effect then they will no longer be sufficient neither the financial means nor new solutions.
In the long run, Member States of the European Union must overcome their national egoism and concentrate on control over the financial markets.
Only Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than EUR 100 billion - it reminds us that Der Standard, according to which European taxpayers, as well as Americans, will have to put their hand on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far been very concerned about the crisis that has passed through the old continent as a tsunami.
"Salvators" should not immediately wind up EUR 100 billion, although it would be better if they set out where taxpayers' money should be affected to prevent greater damage.
The smart machine imitates the flight of the calabron
What could be the best way to develop anticollusion technologies if you don't imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, those of the rivers.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic point to the Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anticollusion systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotized minivan supplying the properties of the rivers, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
As the monkeys fly their own oval personal space that looks really much like our protective shield - he explained to Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology sector and research and development.
Important is the role of the app view, capable of a 300 degree visual in each direction.
The engineers drew attention to the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the app view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two metres within a range of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of according to the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the needle, changes immediately by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This manoeuvre of avoidance, unlike the current system, is carried out in a way that is quite straightforward.
"If it hadn't been so, the robot car wouldn't have reacted fast to avoid collisions," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must respond in an instinctive and immediate way because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what one does to avoid other waters.
This process must take place in an eye battery.
But unlike apis, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can be only bidimensional and in the direction of the sterility of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to the rivers to scan other waters, the robot, as the possibility available, can run on its own, speed up and slow down.
The BR23C is fed by batteries to lithium polymers, more light and high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important to be aware of the extent of the intelligent reaction, not the ability to produce data or even less the capacity to store them.
This robot must develop some input in a few seconds and respond.
There is no need to remember and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvre data, so use only a few decades memory of Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions, which, according to Nissan, can be installed on series vehicles within 10 years.
Further application possibilities can be represented by the integration with the GPS satellite navigation system which avoids the obstacles on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name of the precious child
The written version of the Economic Savings Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate loans was published to be applied in many parts.
In the first pass, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements concluded until mid-night according to the time of the East Coast, the Congress leaders decided the rescue plan of 700 billion dollars after a day-long debate - referred to the Reuters.
We have taken a series of steps forward - Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Representatives, said that it is only after the letter agreement has been signed.
Both the candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the commitment of the plan.
The Minister of Treasure Henry Paulson, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about the saving of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (at 2 p.m. on Monday in Central Europe), but it did not result in a significant increase in interest rates.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft Economic Stabilization Act 2008 on the programme, after which it will reach the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with the Pelosi on Saturday evening, then gladly accepted the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress made last night and we are very grateful for the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to defend the economy - Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House, said.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal from the Bush administration, which provided that $700 billion would have been spent all for the purchase of securities with disproportionate loans.
As a first step, you will be able to spend at least half of the amount of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with which the Treasury Minister will purchase securities with disproportionate loans on the back, of the remaining $100 billion will decide the President.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve is also taking part.
The expenditure of the other half of 700 billion is dependent on a new Congress decree.
Under the law, the Ministry of the Treasure can apply a combined tactic: it can also buy credit cards, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "advanced" credit.
The purchase can happen by means of these and directly - officials of the ministry have announced it.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested parties to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Interior ensures the means of concern for which companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to be reached for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about the purchase of incorrect financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the steps necessary to find us ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed - it has added.
Instead of thinking that the government will limit its well-being, defined by the ultra-ocean slang simply as gold paraquades.
The limitations of payments will only happen in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will provide assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys within an hour, it will impose a surplus on the gold paracaute if they do not send the decaded bank manager pension.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money of directors is not excessive.
In addition, the existing contracts of gold parachutes will not change, the limitation is only valid for the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - Mr Barney Frank, President of the Commission responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives, commented on the provision.
In addition, it has the right to be eligible for a share of the participating banks in the programme, reducing the risk of contributors, since they can, in the end, also benefit if the economy, together with the saved bank, is to return.
The legislative proposal includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress a proposal on how to restore the expected losses from the financial sector to the taxpayers.
Of course both parties were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague at Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street Cross.

The next year in the United States without notice?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility of entering into force on 12 January the US-Hungarian exemption agreement - the Foreign Minister has spoken about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to her opinion, "Now everything depends on the fact that the electronic system of entry and control is being built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no more entry permits in the new system, but the tourists will have to register before the departure.
The responsibility for Hungarian diplomacy will continue to be extended to Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleiza Rice, who will deliver the medal of the Hungarian Republic's Cross with Stella and will engage with foreign political advisers of the Democratic candidate Barack Obama and John McCain.
Even Barack Obama and John McCain were crying in favour of the bank’s rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates at the presidentship of the two large American parties, have guaranteed their support on Sunday for the government plan of 700 billion dollars to save banks, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration after the long-term marathon negotiations announced on Sunday night that they had concluded a principle agreement on bank savings plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the first stage of Obama's economic issues, he has recovered a little bit more than McCain's advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's vice-president, he has been disbanded.
Obama, in a speech to Detroit, expressed the hope that the convention would soon pass the law on the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsiblely (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the full economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
It was not allowed to escape from defining McCain's economic ideas.
McCain in an interview with the ABC explained that "all we will send here with difficulty this situation (...) but not doing anything is not a road forward".
The rapporteur referred to that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he had insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not have a proper role in the agreements, but he was in contact with the Minister on a daily basis.
President Nancy Pelosi spoke on Sunday that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Print drawing of the German language world
The pole of the right is inverted, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent red-and-white coalition.
Mirror (spigel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Baviera revolution destroys its parents analyzes the causes of the damaged drama of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the fall of the CSU has already begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple entered the cargo.
Christian-Socials have renovated the Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are separated from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Mercer.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday it ended a process that was exactly ten years ago realized: the indisputable exemission of a party-state has been completed.
10 years ago, in 1998, CSU was precipitated to 47.7% for the first time under the threshold of 50% from the '50s.
This was repeated three years ago at the election of the Bundestag in 2005 in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
This is because of the subsequent modernisation in the region, which destroys the parents.
Sociologists have predicted it 40 years ago, but they have made a lot of mistakes. However, secularization, the results of education, the placement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernization is taking a similar step with increasing opportunities and there are clear political consequences.
The pole of the right is stuck, only within the pole the voters have become more conscious, critical, hosted.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks CSU itself has been separated from the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates.
This is where support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The daily conservatory came "Who is with whom?" In the article "The Presidents of the Parties are blocked in the issues of coalition" deals with the confusion of Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to deal with the OVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalitions.
The elections were held, now running around the coalition; in the public TV discussion the party leaders had just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to deal with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in social partnership already exists.
Faymann has left the issue open if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Moreer, current president of the ÖVP, as vice- chancellor.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any event rejected.
The repetition of this direction shall not be considered.
Moreer has responded with caution to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not have been successful if Faymann tried to involve himself in OVP's internal affairs.
If your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, questions will be discussed in any case within the ÅVP.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeatedly been open in all directions.
"To prevent red-neer coalition we are ready to assume the responsibility of government," Haider said.
Járóka: The visual cycle of poverty and segregation needs to be spent
Today in Paris, the European Summit for the Opportunity was launched, organised this year by France on the presidency of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Member Fidesz of the European People's Party in the letter addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur for the Congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and in order to overcome the most serious obstacle to their claim.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, have opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil organisations and rights defenders within the same opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Parliamentary Group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the cases, that Roma are expelled from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"Most of the young Roma have no middle-level study title and as a result of the elementary teaching of bad quality only a ridiculous number of them can reach a higher study title".
Járóka also stressed, as man's fundamental right, the key role of education in bringing human rights to the fore.
Investing in Roma children’s education can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these connections more aware of the wider range of Roma and non-Romania.
Indeed, as the school begins a novel, its potential for becoming a productive member of the labour market is increased; through the fees paid for income and consumption they contribute to the budget of the nation.
"The right to European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and secret schools," Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's objective and action is needed to speed up the disintegration of schools, and it is therefore essential that the existing and proposed anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The visual cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, Roma children need to be given opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full-time citizens of the future of Europe," Járóka asked.
In the "European Year of Pairs Opportunities" to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Pairs Opportunities organised every year since last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities at both national and European levels.
CSU: paper for a transitional period
At the end of October you will decide what kind of huber-Beckstein's married couple will do.
Despite the serious electoral failure the tests have not yet been put down, the discussions on personal issues have been forwarded to CSU headquarters for the time being.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and regional Governor Günther Beckstein are still in their place, the question is until the time of the trial.
Of this kind of tandem that has suffered a loss of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary convention at the end of October.
The two highly criticised politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not attacked by all forces at headquarters.
They have thus tried to anger the angry writers of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarese tsunamis" have claimed the personal consequences of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber then at the end of his career, the Christian-Social Union received 60.7%, now after the strike against Stoiber state, dropped to 43.4%.
The 46-year-old CSU has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
Although conservationists in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced in the future in any way to co-operate.
What is the first sign of reorganization within the party is the vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, which is considered possible heir to Huber, receives a place in the limited exploratory group that will initiate negotiations with FDP Liberals and with the Free Elections presenting right values for any government coalition in Monaco di Bavaria.
For a strange feature of the destination in the list of Liberal voters, Gabriele Pauli's attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity to hit Huber-Beckstein's partner to then treat the woman without regard to the great ambitions.
The Heads of the CSU are now focusing all their forces on establishing in some way Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has so far been in the shadow. The former regional and former President of the CSU has defined on 28 September the most beloved day of his political career.
Monday Huber has issued a number of statements to the CSU, which would have deserved more support from the party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be Chancellor after the elections of the Bundestag set for September 2009 unless the CSU has a decisive role to play in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the depletion for the fisco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
This is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the affected CSU, but the crisis of the social democratics is still difficult.
The SPD has achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria by 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability guaranteed in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained by the letters made in the context of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants has been free of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) was expected to be serious that Lukashenko, with a renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections under discussion, "conceeded" some seats in the House to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus abandoned a previously assessed booking.
Following the expectations of the opposition there was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent from Russia, which asked for a loan to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines across the country, aimed at improving the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-level politicians could not enter into the democratic-based Belarusian political situation.
It referred to a distance in which the OSCE, by assessing the electoral campaign, had focused on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of submitting themselves for a third of the opposition's candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid Monday report also criticised the campaign, during which candidates for opposition in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that opposition could not be present in the context of the votes.
Despite this opposition, there is a perception of improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus has been forming a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one behind, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Aleksandr Milinkevich has said in our journal Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the 2006 election opposition, it is expected that although "the power had been afraid to make one oppositioner into a Parliament without weight, it is expected that "the power would also be able to get into one Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide for protest actions for the results but rather tries to bring the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we need to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities are having difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support the change, even among the elders - Milinkevich said that it is not even the most helpful time for the pensioners, that the Lukashenko regime, which considers its main result to be the creation of social security.
As a result of the country's indebtedness and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time for the disaggregation of social security "which reminds sepolcral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to the opposition policy, the Russian observers judged democratic elections.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian press agency RIA Novosti: "Men do not believe in words but in fact," so the lack of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were round doors for the entry and exit of the employees.
But from now on he's taking this new measure against the furbets, against those who are afraid and then he's going to have a coffee at the bar in working hours.
The anti-fannulloni novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council's presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rolling doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
"Now a new phase of responsibility and transparency is opened.
This is reform," Brunetta continues to point out.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of rolling doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There have been no resistance from employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was cooperation between them all".
In summary, no more meals in working hours; no more coffee and cornet.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. is a holy hand".
In the course of a meeting at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the absence of public workers' disease has reduced by 50%, i.e. 60,000 people in more than one year's work".
And it adds that it is necessary to make public administration more efficient.
Italian, "their wage dynamics - explained by the Minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
So many thousands of public employees have joined in protesting the rules of the Brunetta Decree by joining in the action supported by the Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service is now failing numbers about the minor absenteeism at work due to illness - writes consumer association - the people of 'operous funnulloni' are growing.
In fact, in Italy there are thousands of right and productive public administration employees who are united to declare war on the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, Tar will be responsible for the exclusion of additional economic treatments for nursing dependent on service; the extension of the time limits of rehabilitation of the sick worker, including visits to control, and other aspects of the new provisions of the Minister.
Incidents of Work, Napolitan: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail's data confirm that white deaths have been about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost double the deaths compared to the murders.
In order to draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, Anmil now celebrates the 58th National Day for the Victims of Labour accidents, institutionalized in the second Sunday of October in all provinces of Italy.
"The concerns expressed by Anmil and the same chronic tragedies of these days confirm how crucial it is to prevent work," said the President of the Republic of Georgia Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "living appreciation for the constant association commitment to preventing jobs, the protection of internally displaced workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, there has been an angry 'a lot', sincerely shared, of course, in the face of tragedy which, for their size, stirs up the media clarinet and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality proposes dramatic, even repeated, cases in their dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt also a resource problem: it is determined to invest in training and information.
In particular, many initiatives promoted in the school field take place for a more direct awareness-raising of young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention alive to the phenomenon, not to be alarmed about its social seriousness, to apply and improve the legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment towards immediate end-of-life pigs".
"The data on the survey on work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not make the number of white deaths impressive at all," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not like, in fact, that this "adversity tendency" is translated into less attention, because it is right when attention is encouraged to exploit the tragedy.
"We believe that at general level it is still too little to counter the phenomenon of torture and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, Mercandelli has stressed more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this is from the school world."
"It is a further effort - it has added - on the communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then complained "the progressive deterioration of the levels of wage protection envisaged for the victims of work" and "the austerity to which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to restore the employer's insurance guarantee - it added - because the type of person involved should not depend on spontaneousism or sometimes extension provided by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under the charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
That is how the European Commission, in a communication published in Brussels, refers to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with musical equipment weekly for more than one hour a day holding the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in irreparable ways," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific discoveries - continues responsible Ue - emerges a clear risk and we must respond quickly.
More importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and take the step with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - close the Ue executive - confirm that there is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and fine equipment".
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage can arise from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit many of these damages by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee indicates that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits on the maximum volume allowed on the workplace.
Those who listen to music under these conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would mean 5-10% of users of these devices and their number could be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the UE.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission a way for the future of capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be cut.
This is the timetable set by the Championship for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at its new headquarters behind the terms of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission components will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the battle is closed in March, the Youth and the Council will evaluate analyses and projects so as to be able to present the Strategic Plan for Rome by June with the "official Bullion" of the Championship and its German syndicate Gianni.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all the political, social and cultural ideas - it has to underline Germany - it will have to provide proposals for a development idea for Roma whose political decisions, which remain the Council and the Council, will then be able to proceed.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will wake up, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the union - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
In view of the fact that the Commission's opinions are not binding, Germany repeats: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, both in France and with the Italian Commission and as certain as they are in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is too often focused on day-to-day management and the emergencies that sometimes occur.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further away, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness in the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Council of Rome has to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a car: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roma citizens and will serve to justify and involve the best intelligence expressed by the capital".
For Germany, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or real estate, to allow our city to make a genuine level jump, which it has absolutely needed, thinking with a single spirit in its future."
A future that, according to Rome's syndicate "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look well beyond" not only at the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first president anti-American. That's why.
He wrote an American political note that has to happen to us as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in his decisions, decided the US economy and had relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks against Obama increase as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big toy face: he believes that he will win the highest rank of a nation that has had both governors and five black senators!".
In fact, there are attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racist attacks and do not respond to the question of voters: will he be a good president? And there are cops; they all say Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there's someone talking to the heart but not to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabinet to vote we know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It goes out a side of the U.S. mentality kept covered up to the end.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll think about where to put the crochet, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll leave America.
Things never happened before now, which almost certainly proved the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasons, however, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home by foot to sit in.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the valogs.
However, Iraq for the majority was the weak point of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic tract is also about journalists: in newspapers there is time to cut. And many people blame the Internet, "kill" of the printed paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, the journalists today are almost all pessimists on their future.
However, the newsmen have not stated openly that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destructive economic model.
In addition, cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that will be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public understands it substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the U.S. journalist today.
You are on ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the most national journal is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against Broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Most editorial houses open a boat to the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are covering technology in the hope that they "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - i.e. the directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure their reporters share their values, while the percentage falls to 23% at local level.
For some, this has to do with "work security."
Executives who are planning to lose their job for 3 years are 47% at national level.
For staff reporters, it's going to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, etc) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a large nation like the US, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet workers often offer what they want and become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
Directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can also earn $10 billion a month, plus pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reason is complicated: all days after the first year, after the third to reach 15 days of total after a certain number of years.
But U.S. journalists, for their admission, often "amen" during the year.
It's all climate issues.
UNIPOL: Roman court, DANilo Coppola RESTA GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaud, decided to reject the instance of real estate owner Danilo Coppola who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banknote in the investigation into the Unipol-Bnl scale dispute.
In the course of the process to be carried out, last week, he received the expulsion from the households transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the realtor could pass the traffic from the province's citizen to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, however, these transfers (which he held against the pm) would allow him to influence his company and access to the evidence they accuse him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon was already shown a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion rescue plan from the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday by informing us that the current crisis is spreading the party, which is increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, rather than conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, particularly in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the point, which was made mostly alive by the vote I said at the outset.
But this is just one example of the changes, the major changes, that the current economic earthquake may announce or already let it collapse: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps even here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe the crisis seems to function as a accelerator for incubation phenomena since they stabilize and finally become light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the double category State sovereignty in relation to a kind of economic renationalization.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, ties with the outside, but which are first of all largely involved in the balance of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who rule it: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, inter alia, are also elected.
In short, the crisis appears globally but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism appears to be essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the various interests and between the various state strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of each State that all expect intervention, rescue and relief plans, new rules, and, above all, fund-raising: since when it comes to the streets it is only the States that own the economic resources, the amount of financial resources that can seek to restore things in the sixties.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimisation to use them: two invaluable resources, in certain circumstances, of which no market or international organization will ever be able to reach the same level.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-national element is of greater importance than the recent economic developments tend to attach to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the kingdom of the network, of more sophisticated technology, of material, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we agreed on a treaty that our future would have to make account to a growing extent with those things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that look a little, of course, can be transported from place to place on the other side of the earth but are still absolutely connected to a circuit area, to a territory.
So that whoever is to be sovereign, he certainly has a lot of cards in addition to those who are not, to those who are lucky to live in a place without collections, without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second news that's coming, but it's a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, says politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for self-responsive leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of mistrust for existing leadership, economic species, appeared so inadequate and full of shade zones.
And together something even deeper and in some disturbing sense: a discrepancy, an inconsistencies, an image of inequality, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class leading to an increasing number of Western countries.
It seems that in large sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of social elites up to now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, has made its own time and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The request for leadership, in summation, provides underground a ramification but has a movement of delegation of the leading classes and traditional political seats, which is manifested in the electoral "revolving" improvises or recent developments of the collective moods of these and recent times, from the conservative access in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of labor agreements in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the right victory in Italy has something to do).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rhythms, their journals, their intellectuals, their beliefs, their format would make it increasingly difficult to understand, and so to represent, what is not taking shape in the deep streets of Western societies and that the economic crisis is invigorating, increasing, potentially destabilizing.
In the face of all this speaking of a 'blessed mass' rebellion on the agenda, it would be quite overemphasized.
But keeping your eyes clearly open is definitely nothing.
The supercollage to walk on the walls
Break the laws of gravity by means of a super hill and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close.
With an adhesion of just 2.5 inches [2.5 cm], the students were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of those existing who use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubs.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of tubes systemed as a spaghetti pile," explains zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the jaws of geese, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure a perfect animal membership.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesion is ten times more powerful than these rectangles and at the same time "it is easy to stand out from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
CAMMINATE ON THE MURI? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesion" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use than the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For the moment, there's nothing superhero.
ALTRA RIERCA – The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesion.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesion form of microfibre as hair that are self-polluted by dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherence.
Pharmacists: more fruit juices
Attention to the juice of orange juice, orange juice and honey.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are dispersing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time with some healthy medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or reducing their effectiveness according to the case, with serious health consequences.
Reconfirming the risks of fruit juices has been obtained as freshs associated with the use of some medicines by David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who, from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, has launched a new alarm: just a bottle of powder, orange and honey juice to reduce the absorption of some healthy medicines, cancel the benefits and endanger the health of patients.
The powder sugar was already finished under the charge because it was considered responsible for increasing up to levels considered toxic the effects of some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotics, ansylitis, anti-staminic and neurological medicinal products.
RISCHIO PACKAGE LEAFLET - The same Italian Medicine Agency had informed you in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger caused by this mix and to take care of what you are drinking if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT only POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and honey also contain substances that inhibit medicines.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by the pump and other juices.
The call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These findings are reported to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies which are likely to change the informational notes of the pharmaceuticals.
So always read the package leaflets that are taken and if there is something that is not clear, don’t impress us but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” stressed the expert to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for Economics in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-keynian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical choices in the economy and foreign policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron fell, Krugman had planned in an editorial published on New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prophecy that will not be a few inches away and that has been addressed to the economist for years, but that has now become clear.
"I'm surprised and I'm also a little shocked at the speed with which the record of scandals like Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive-style publisher, particularly critical of the excessive liberalisation of Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the suite open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from house to house, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work by volunteer developers, to which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office shows to the big audience with different news: on the welcome screen and on the magazine interface and makes less apart, if they add more substantial than the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also to interoperability with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are some specific features of some modules such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint's presentations, for example useful for sending them via e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create documents "PDF hybrids", which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text manufacturer.
Co-operation is an element that has received various improvements within the application: in the calculation sheet, more hands can be used between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes in the test laboratory, each partner is assigned a colour in the comments for better recognition at the revision stage.
Some companies are also working to bring some functionality of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks they should deliver the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent at home or at work at the request.
And if the subject of freeness can be a practice for the dissemination of houses, it is right in business that Open Office then tries to achieve the great success, and can already count on various projects already carried out in public administration and schools.
And they don't even lack the facts that offer an ideal training service, advice and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video script of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for powerpoint; Dbase presentations, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, it is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now almost 3 million and 600 billion, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected number.
Also Kohl positive result is the fourth case of doping
A new case of positiveity in the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-classed and winner of the best-scaling match.
To report the news is the newspaper's website The Team.
The 26th Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also the Gerolsteiner.
The blood samples of Kohl include those performed in the last weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the controls confirm the positiveness of Cera, Austria will lose its third place at the Tour and will meet two years of canonic squallification.
To confirm Kohl's positive news to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordy, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th Austrian was placed on the final floor behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also adding the softness to a better scaler.
Immigrate: NEW YORK TIMES AND CHIEDE, IS ITALIA RAZZIST?
Italy "from a country of immigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with a resurgence.
This is transforming the Belgian into a nation of racists? Is it how long you ask in a New York Times article that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, the original leader of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is registered but also the "higher anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the highest support for the North League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation proposed by the League that narrows the barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine people is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Substantial trend between the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Georgia Napolitano met Benedict XVI at Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to suppress racism."
Victim students of caro-affiti up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken a very serious nature to exclude the whole range of young people from the right to the study for the most comprehensive costs that families of origin should bear - explains the responsibility of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so deformed the market to launch a process of generalised increase for residents."
In most cases, rental offers then contain a series of infringements: free-of-charge contracts, not registered, with no limit of cannons, connected sub-affiliates.
The Union needs extraordinary intervention which, through the revision of tax taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed place in Brianza area, there are about 450 euros; for a single room there is a minimum of 650 (Bande Black zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence an average cost of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they spend 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 per single.
In Rome near central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other universities (Ostian and Cinecity).
Save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed place and 450 units in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed room is 300/450 euros, for a room it costs from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed place, there were 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rentals is more common for extra-Community students, such as Perugia, there is an additional anomaly: the increase of approximately 25/30% of the canon required for foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Old Adio cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historical halls
The historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore takes a picture of what is happening in the great Italian urban centres but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great crowds and the subsequent death of the monastics in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem unforgettable and undisputable but also has all the features of a real and cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and memory loads,"it's like if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and so many emotions," observes the director of New Film Paradise, the film that 20 years ago went to Tornatore the Oscar prize and the Grand Prize of the Cannes jury, and that told about the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the movie that may have been lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the performers, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and in order to pay the highest score are rooms in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 missing single cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsibility of their disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisalal cinemas: 195 screens in more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but should ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall is closed, not all its participants are willing to move to multiplex.
In order not to talk about the lack of funding for the staff: the state's advance debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful, from a ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would be between 16 and 18 million euros a year.’
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to run to the repairs with the signature of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote the monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and in the peripheral.
Among the standards provided for are tax relief measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: inspectors may enter the restricted area of traffic and will have special rates for support and in some parks.
"It's an initiative I like" observes Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by taking other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter the trapping of multiplex, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinama, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise cinema", which I had thought for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've gone before the Rialto or the Quirinale of National Road now closed, where I've lived so many shared emotions, so that I can't see the cartels from dust around me from the other side."
Links between politics and the arrest warrant by Gioia Tauro
"The union of Gioia Tauro was available to unify the choices of the Comune to the interests of the Piromelli Cosca".
The charges are heavy which the judges of the Anti-Fraud Directorate of Calabria refer to the union and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torreone and Rosario Schiavone, and the union of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested for external competition in mafiosous association.
In addition, Joaacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his lawyer's nephew, homonymous boss, has already been convicted of association for crimes of mafia, sentenced to 10 million euros.
"In spite of any legal and moral standards, as well as the good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromelli.
"It would have been given to the cost - the judges - to enter the municipalities officially by facilitating the possibility, scope, control and address of public administration."
The president of the Calabrese regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local and organised evil institutions are numerous" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than elsewhere, where collision is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'draghet', heroes who keep themselves clean'.
The arrests are following those of July last with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromelli.
Since the end of April, the Council of the Council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local policies have been raised by the responsibility of administering the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, a union of the Udc at the time of the shooting, was elected head of a Central Coalition after May 2006.
He screamed at the scandal when Prefecture ordered the eviction of the municipal council.
He called on the then Deputy Minister of Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of architecting everything on a political issue, but the judges, in order to arrest him, explained that the Piromelli Cosca was right to ask for a change in the A3 project.
From the environmental interviews ordered against Dal Torreone, they write the pms, "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a wider group known to be close to the Piromalls, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the coast".
When energy is born from where now go down the big fields
It's a broken roof, which takes over 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are putting it out.
Where, currents, seas are the new renewable sources on which the eyes have been on, and now they're trying to put their hands, like the Chevron.
The possibility of getting energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of calolo oil, around 1980, the idea of enjoying marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil are driving the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by engines operating on the sea.
This would be the double of what is currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And there would be currents and seas.
I'm stuck in the attack.
The first shipping company was Enersis, which signed an agreement to build an installation in North Portugal in 2005.
When the intent was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
For two years there are always more and more of these companies that have always been voted for in traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - he said the spokesman of a company associated with the U.S. coal oil company in the Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the acquisition of a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
It is not a sign at all, especially if it is considered that in Alaska, the US continue to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan for new disturbances.
In addition to Chevron there are New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to cross the road of energy from the sea and the sums invested so far, as not mentioned in the details, indicate an interest in the rise.
Technology to put the point.
Experts are still talking about a technology to trees, even because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now plants such as that Portuguese or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major ecosystem problems.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technology must be used with a higher environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a well-connected system between them.
The tension of waves, which moves the bows up and down here, is turned into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders within the galleys.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The electricity is sent to the river through submarine cables.
For now there are four installations of this type in the design process, pending only federal approval and part of energy could serve for military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are the seas rotates the balloons of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After it's gone, the sea.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It's about the energy of the seas that were like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that are facing costs, have already invested 7 million and half a million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
