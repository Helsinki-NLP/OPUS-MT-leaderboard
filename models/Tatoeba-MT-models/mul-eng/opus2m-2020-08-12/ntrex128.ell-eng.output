All Members are worried that they're going to beat them with "maps"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern was raised in connection with the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members throughout the political area are worried that something like this will be heard ridiculously.
A member of the Working Party said his resignation worried that "it would be the same with the words Twp and Pwp".
For non-Walily identifiers: In the wave, the word "twp" means "fashion" and the word "pwp" means "pwp".
A member of the Plaidt said that the distribution was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
A conservative Wall said his distribution was "open" about the change of name, but he noted that the word MWP does not much escape from the word "mapet".
In this context, the reference text w is similar to the English version of Jörksair of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drawing up the draft legislation on the establishment of the name change, stated: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will of course be the case of the Members themselves."
The Act of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Parliament of Italy the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which were widely accepted for the name of the House as Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission endorsed the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but the MWP option was the one which was more supported during the public consultation.
Members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the attempt to achieve consensus may be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill for the change in the name within the next few weeks.
The Law on Reform will also include other changes in the way of the functioning of the House, inter alia, rules of exclusion from the duties of the Member and the design of the Commission system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the debate on legislation.
The citizens of the GDR are coming to the summit on the resolution on the change in the name of the country
The votes will vote on the Sunday on the change in the name of the country to "Northern Macedonia's Republic".
The people's vote was called for in an attempt to resolve a conflict for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own jurisdiction called Macedonia.
It is claimed that the name of the north-east of Athens undermines territorial views and has been repeatedly opposed to its requests for EU and NATO integration.
Giorge Ivanoff, president of the IDP, a war on the resolution on the change in the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the resolution, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, insist that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their EU-NATO integration.
St. Martin's camps have collapsed since the churches in Harlem are destroyed
"The older people I talked to said there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Andams.
Today, there is none of them."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socialized differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the salon of the neighborhood where the world regularly meets."
As for the churches, it is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not hold as long as officials hope "and will soon return to the point where they started".
The churches, in addition, can be replaced by multi-citizens with people who will not be willing to help the refugee countries that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The taxable majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will observe the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people will move to these departments to become members of the churches."
And the two churches were built by white churches before the Charles Mtrepolitical community was built in 1870, a decade later in St. Martin.
The early Methodist church was abandoned in the 1930 ’ s.
A black church located in a nearby distance took possession of the building.
The owner of St. Martin's building held a black church under the schoolhouse of John Howard Johnson, which went on to the ammo of the 125th Street stations, a main commercial street in Harlem, which refused to catch or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s cousins took over the reconstruction and ordered the hurricane.
Professor David Johnson, son and heir of Father Johnson in St. Martin's church, openly called the charity "the camps of the poor".
The specialist who played the career in July described it differently: "political treasure" and "an anti-historical instrument of historical importance".
The specialist, Tiffany Inn from Michigan University, also noted that he was the first child in the world to be played by black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who was transferred to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mirichveder said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What happens in the last few months in St. Martin is a complex story between architects and workers, some of whom were adopted by the church’s popular leaders, others from the point of view.
The directors - the administrative body of the entity, which is made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter to July to the audience on their concerns that the visit "would be intended to transfer the cost" to the committee body, although this did not have any involvement in the arrest of the architects and workers sent by the church.
Some critics expressed concern about the lack of transparency on the part of the survey.
13-year-old coal mine for urban areas in California
Carcharia was attacked and wounded 13-year-old boy on Saturday during sieges for urban fishing in California on the first day of the city's time, according to the authorities.
The attack was recorded just before 7 B.C.E. near Lake Bion Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had sex with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard his baby crying for help and approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a little bit of excitement 'cause he got tired, but then he realized he was calling me "Something hit me!
Something hurt me!"
The whole key was open," Hamel observed when he got to the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's cancer in the sea!' added Hamel.
The boy was transferred by plane to Pados Randy Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of cancer responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Navigator Larry Jails said in the press that the carnage had been found in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was thought that it was not in any kind of danger.
Jails added that the victim is causing serious damage to the top of the chest.
The authorities forbade access to the beach from Ponto Bys in Casambland to Suamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of carcinoma in the region, but most are not considered to be dangerous.
Saninsbury's projects put pressure on the market for artificial products
The Sainsbury's are amused with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams installing artificial reefs corresponding to these multi-storeys, controlled by special staff.
In the context of the significant increase in the EU’s agricultural market of 2,8 %, which continues to develop while sales of types of investment and household species are falling, the largest crop line will be tested in 11 situations across the country and will be exhausted in more cases if the company fails.
Investment in the crop sector comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to fill up the area in areas that once understood televisions, smallpox and domestic species.
The Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their artistic offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also give more space with letters from the company's logo, like those of these rooms such as Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its series of Boutique makeups so that most products are vegan - something that the newer consumers ask for.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to have its products available in two Sanisbury's stations, the one that opened up in Crodinton, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Bermiham later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend of the market for small quantities of food per day in local retail markets mean that supermarkets should pay greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Kup, director of Sanisbury's, said that outlet situations will be more and more like multi-storeys, as the supermarket alliances are trying to compete with the outstanding Aldi and Lidl with more other services than food.
The Saninsbury's put outlet Argos in hundreds of situations, and also introduced some Habitats as they bought the two chains two years ago, which supported sales of poultry species and placed more profitable exports.
The previous attempt by the Supermarket to refuel the chemical and pharmaceutical components failed.
The Sainsbury's tried a dialogue with the Boots in the early part of the 2000s, but cooperation ended after an interview on how to distribute profits from drug situations in the supermarkets of the Alliance.
The new strategy has been designed since Sanisbury's sold the drug company that you have with 281 apartments in Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy alliance, over £ 125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the project by adding an extended range of multi-purpose supply companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four situations.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sanisbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our rabbis in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also devoted ourselves to a particular trained staff who will be available to provide advice.
The area of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the flexible environment and the comfortable places mean that we are no longer a possible destination for the artists who challenge the traditional way of markets."
Peter Jones: more than after the release of Holly Willowby from the 11 million-price agreement
The promoter of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is exorbitant after the release of Holly Willoby from the 11 million-dollar agreement with the firm lifestyle it has, in order to end up in its new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoby has no time for the investment company and insurance company Truly.
Their company was similar to Goop of Guineth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old exhibit "This Morning" announced in Instagram her decision to quit.
Holly Willoby has taken over the proponent of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving the last-minute livestyle business, in order to end up in its new great agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became exaggerate when the gold girl of television was accepted during a full-time third-time conference at the central offices of his government in Marlou, Bachhamshire, that because of the new contributions - up to £1.5 million - he would no longer have enough time to be available to the investment company and insurance company Truly.
The company was compared to Goop of Guinnett Paltrow and appears to double the assets of Willobie, which is estimated to be £11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willoby in Instagram announced that he was going to be released from Truly, Jones left Britain to some of his remote homes.
According to some source: "Truly was far from Holly Wilomby's top priorities.
It is about its long-term future, its income for the next decade.
Her decision to give up was an exception to all those involved in the undertaking.
No one could believe what happened to the Third, so close to the presentation.
There is a full store of products in the central offices in Marlow ready for sale."
The experts believe that the withdrawal of this morning's "This Morning" exhibition, which is co-ordinated between Britain's most commercial sales, could cost millions to the company because of the huge investment in products from pastry and grain to clothing and household items, as well as further delay in its presence.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willowby, mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife maintain close friendship with Jones and Tara Cap's wife here for ten years.
Willoby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined March.
The couple spend their vacations together and Jones keeps a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoby is going to become the central figure in the M&S camps and replace And McPartlin in the presentation of the "I'm A Celebrity" on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to discuss his professional cases."
We were tough and then we fell in love.
He was concerned about the criticism received from the media about a speech that some would consider inappropriate to a president, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
Trab told me the top televisor.
"I didn't leave anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trab as a major step towards the abolition of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for decommissioning have been delayed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat Ray Young-Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "relevant response" from the United States after the previous North Korean armament.
On the contrary, he stressed that the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trab kept a much more comfortable position in his speech.
"We're going very well with North Korea," he said.
"We're almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
We have now built this extraordinary relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim gave positive results - the end of the gun trials, the release of the troops and the return of the other American soldiers to their homes.
I supported his inconsistencies in his statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a "presidential" body, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't get in, we'd have only 200 people here," Trab said, pointing out the crowd before him.
tsunamis and tsunamis in Indonesia haunt an entire island, leaving thousands of dead dead in their path.
At the end of the season in Lobok, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental agencies would not need assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lobok's population had been displaced, there was no national destruction, a necessary condition for assessing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is quite difficult," said Mr. Somung.
While the organization Save the Children is preparing a group that will travel to Paul, it is not yet certain if the outside staff can work on site.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the National Natural Disaster Service, said that the Indonesian authorities had assessed the situation in Paul to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute.
Given the seismic gifts common in Indonesia, the country remains extremely unprepared against the rise in nature.
While refugees have been built for tsunamis in Athens, the same is not true in other octoblasts.
The apparent lack of a series of warnings for tsunamis in Paul, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters add even more to the administrative burden.
A large hospital that had been stationed in Lobok to overcome the victims of the plague is heading to Paul, but they will need at least three days to arrive at the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Woodonto was at the centre of the campaign's electoral centre to improve Indonesia's redesigned infrastructures and provided simple money to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding is due to Mr Joe's administration before the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the persistent apparent trend in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were killed as Christian and Muslim groups are fighting on the streets using swords, bullets and bullets, as well as other weapons.

"I've seen Candee get close, I've made a direct change, I haven't thought about it much and I've done it to you."
Chelsea had a 1-0 preview in the afternoon after the gol in 25 minutes from Belgo Star Enden Azar.
The attacker's blue guy gave a pass with the sitting at Mato Kovats in this game, before giving you a box near the center of the ground and running to Liverpool.
Kovatisse did it one by one at the center of the ground.
Next, he gave a very old man, leading Ezra to the great region.
Azar ran ahead of the defense and completed the ball by sending the ball back to the rear dock with a left foot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.

Chelsea will face Videton in UEFA Europe League on Friday in London.
The tragic calculation of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia is 832
The calculation of the deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the statements of the country's natural disaster service before the sun.
Many people were trapped in the collapse of the buildings after the 7.5 degree stage that covered the area of the Parochei area and created a 6-metre peak, said the representative of the service, the Nugrojo Puruyo Station, at a kind of meeting.
The city of Paul, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the damaged buildings.
The police took 32 years, a suspect, after killing a woman with a sword
A murder investigation began after a woman discovered her body in Birkenhend, in Mercheind this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 B.C.E. with injuries from bullets at Grayson Mouse in John Stritt, while a 32-year-old man was gathered as a witness to the murder.
The police asked the district where they saw or heard something to put it in the police.
Police officer Brian Ohegan said: "The investigation is at an initial stage, but I would like to call anyone who was in the neighborhood around John Strett and saw or heard something about communicating with us.
I would also like to address an appeal to anyone, especially the travel leaders, who may have written something on the planes of the dashcam cameras to communicate with us as they may have the information that is vital for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birchend and found inside a building.
Today, friends who believe they can know the woman who went into the crime scene to ask questions about the location she was found this morning.

Cromwell's victory in Parliament is the last reminder of his friendship for "recording history"
His extremism would be a legitimate cause for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works by his fanatically-appointed supporters.
However, Colonel Cromwell described Mr Crick's proposal as "an emergency" and "an attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, President of Cyllogo Cromwell, said: "In this debate on the elimination of hunger, it was unlikely that the form of Oliver Cromwell would not be targeted outside of Westminster's Anesthetists.
The iconography of England's civil wars was neither banned nor implemented by Cromwell.
Perhaps a member of Cromwell’s family had been killed for the actions of Thomas’s predecessor in the previous century.
Cromwell's outstanding invention by Ser William Hamo Thornicroft is a feature of his 19th century image and part of the history of a personality that many believe is worth a price tax.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Promoting is still considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century in relation to today, as a MEP against external pressures, in his case, of course, monopolies.
The fact that this is a very specific case is the issue of an open historical debate.
The only thing is, of course, that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of the continent.
His achievements as Lord Prostitution are also worthy and valuable."
Hoiros-killer wounded a dying Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in South China, according to local news reports.
The man, who was known only as "Waan", was found with a mixed artery in a blood stream near a railway station on the market of Lioupansway in the province of Guitsou, South China announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A co-manufacturer is prepared to take injections in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Zining in the province of Kinhai, China.
He must have traveled with his cousin from the nearby town of June on Wednesday to sell 15 dogs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a nearby restaurant.
He said there was a huge Arsenic pig with blood in his mouth.
The medical examination confirmed that the dog that married 227 kilograms had been fatally injured by the farmer, according to his report.
"My brother's feet were torn and broken," said the Hatter, known as "Uu," according to Guigiang's evening newspaper.
The security camera plans show Owen entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Friday to pay for the dogs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Owen or his brother.
One market official announced in the evening news sheet that the pig has been placed in a cage to avoid being attacked by anyone else, while the police collected evidence in the attack scene.
The Ouan family and the market authorities are being negotiated for some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of dog attacks in humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a dog attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, seriously harming the man.
Ten years ago, a 395 - mile [295 km] rain hit a farmer in Waalia on the road where the farmer’s wife terrorized the animal to get away.
After the situation in which a farmer from Oregon was beaten by his dogs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba said to CBC News that dogs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "union".
"They're just playing games.
It's small, very strange plastics... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa tribe are going to bring extensive flooding to the South American
According to estimates, the Roza typhoon is sick as it moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Roza Typhoon will bring closures to North Mexico and South America in the coming days.
The strength of the Rosa tube’s nams reached 85 mph, as Category 1, at 5 p.m. Eastern Time, the sun was located and 385 miles south of Punta Eunchenia, Mexico.
The Russians are expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure area has begun to be formed above the Pacific Ocean and moved east to the West Coast of the United States. As the Russians approach the South California peninsula on Tuesday, a tropical lake will bring a change of water to the north of South America.
The Rosary will bring floods of up to 25 per cent in the regions of Mexico on Tuesday.
As a result, tropical moisture combined with the area of low blood pressure approaching will create extensive strong floods in the South in the next few days.
Locally, floods of between 2.5 and 10 per cent will cause dangerous floods, fluxes of contamination and possibly flooding.
Heavy tropical acids will lead to flooding rates approaching 5 by 7.5 per cent per hour, particularly in parts of the South Nevada and Arizona.
Flows of 5 to 10 per cent are expected in locations in the South, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Plums are likely to cause real damage to the apparent due to the dispersal nature of the mucous membranes.
It is recommended that you avoid any movement with your feet in the stomach in view of the risk of accidental flooding.
Heavy flooding can transform the dams into normal rivers and the dams will cause local flooding and flooding.
The low-pressure area will create some powerful local floods in the North California coast.
A total drop of over 1 percent is possible, which can cause small flow of stress and flexibility on the streets.
This will be the first case of the cold season in the region.
Some divergent tropical islands will begin to approach Arizona later on Sunday and early Monday, before the apparent spreads on Tuesday and Tuesday.
The mighty floods will take place in the For Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Thursday.
In October some intense changes in temperature will be observed throughout the United States as temperatures in the Arctic decline, but in tropical areas they remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very severe changes in temperature in nearby areas.
A characteristic example of intense differences in temperature between Central America was observed on Sunday.
There were almost 10 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and the Group, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Mon in Iowa.
In the next days, constant high thermal temperatures will be observed and re-examined.
In most of the Central and Eastern United States, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern areas to parts of the South-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Wednesday, about 5 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term forecast for the period, there are many possibilities to observe temperatures above the average in the Eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million TV users were watching Bret Kavano's hearing.
More than 20 million television broadcasters followed the official listing of the U.S. Supreme Court of State Brit Kavano, the Fifth and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political departure continued with television networks to stop the regular flow of the programme for the last time on Friday: the agreement by the President of Arizona, Mr Jeff Flick, to conduct a week's research by the FBI on categories.
Ford told the Justice Commission of Georgia that it is 100 percent sure how at a party while Kavano was a student of law she was attacked while she was beaten and committed to taking off her clothes.
Kavano, in a charged case, said that it is 100 percent sure that something like this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's estimates, more than 20.4 million televisions were likely to be heard on Friday.
The company submitted the average TV on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that made it available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
However, Nielsen often finds it difficult to calculate the number of television stations following a transfer from offices.
For us to see this television in the right areas, it is a common size corresponding to what is followed by a multi-stakep race or the end of the Oscar season.
The Fox News channel, by which journalists have been able to support Kavanno's appointment, has been launched with an average of 5.69 million televisions during the entire hearing, according to Nielsen.
Second, the ABC is located with 3.26 million televisions.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after hearing.
Flick became a protest in the afternoon drama.
Following the declaration by the Republican metropath that it will vote in favour of Kavano, CNN and CBS's cameras recorded Friday morning speakers to welcome him as he tried to enter the canister for hearing from the Justice Commission of Georgia.
He was sitting with the look down for a few minutes as he was adopted, living on television at CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are weak."
Flick said that his office had made statements and, before closing his scanner doors, he would have more to say to the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were closed a few hours later, the vote of the Committee on Justice of Georgia on promoting Kavana's accession to the Republic of Georgia to the vote.
However, Felix said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the applications against the invitation next week, which was requested by a minority of the Democrats.
Flick was part of a discussion with his friend, the Head of the Democratic Party, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with Küns and some other Gerossists, Flick decided.
Flick's election was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not concentrate on votes for the approval of Kavano without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to carry out an investigation on charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the beneficiaries of the evictions plans from the European Union that they "play political games" with Britain's future and undermine national interest in a meeting with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Berlin, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
At another meeting with her own in the press's initiative, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson is making serious criticism of the Czechs project for Brexit, saying that the proposal for a tax exemption between Britain and the EU was "very similar".
Firefighting Weind Sims: The police arrested Captain Diane Simson for the murder of the player in LSU
The police took a look at the deadly gunfire of Weind Sims, a 20-year-old LSU's basketball team player.
Diane Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and kept in prison with a second-level murder category, according to Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Sims' complex with Simson and according to the police Sims lost his glasses during the checkout.
The police put the glasses in the crime scene and said they had a sign from Samson's DNA, according to WAFB co-operated with CBS.
After Samson's reaction, the police said it was accepted that he had killed Wayne.
His guarantee was $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by Dr. Baton Rouz, who circled the Friday, death is the trauma of snakes in the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Georgian Police a special working group, the police station, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the region to assist in the search for asylum.
LSU's sports director Joi Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "confidential research and promotion of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Fortord raised 1,98 feet [1.98 m] by Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played a basketball for LSU.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebacks per fight last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's Basket team promoter Will Waind said the team was "compressed" and "in shock" since Weind's death.
"We're always worried about situations like this," said Wade.
Explosion of physiological fever in Mexico City
The ephistical zephras emissions from the Popocapetel plant reached the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the inhabitants of Mexico to stay away from the shelter after the state's activity reached its peak, with 183 emissions of gases and sulphur within 24 hours.
The Centre followed several indications and small seismic donations.
Images on social media show car coverage covered with minutes of wires near the city of Mexico such as Socymillo.
The geologists observed an increase in the activity of the pheasant located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the initiative since the time a 7.1 ricter was observed in central Mexico in September 2017.
The puzzle known as "Don Gogo" has been active since 1994.
Police forces are against Catalan self-employed in view of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six persons were gathered in Barcelona on Saturday after a meeting of protesters in favour of independence with the rehabilitating units of the class, as thousands participated in the demonstrations for the first year from the vote on the reunification of Catalonia which resulted in a city.
A group of masked exhibitors for independence, which were tied up by the rehabilitating units of the class, excavated eggs and pigs into dust, creating a bunch of dirt in the streets that are usually hidden by tourists.
In addition, complexions were also noted later during the day with the police to use their clubs to place the complexes.
For hours groups of supporters of the independence of Catalonia called the sign "We Don't Forgive, We Don't Forget" against groups of protesters for the unity of the country that called "I ask for Spain".
Forty people were diagnosed with microterrorisms observed during the demonstrations, according to local type.
The intentions remain high in the region which supports independence one year after the declaration of the Republic of Madrid of 1 October as illegal, which is however dominated by the autonomous Catalans.
The tax majority of voters chose independence, although the approach was low with those who objected to the independence to distort the resolution.
According to the Italian authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police authorities tried to stop the vote at the electoral centres in the area where there were violent complications.
Groups for independence formed Friday in order to prevent a national police support operation.
The operation was carried out elsewhere, and it had to be changed differently.
Narcis Termas, 68, an electrician who participated in demonstrations for his wife's independence, said he no longer allowed hope for her prospects to win her independence.
"In the past we lived one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they were about to vote, but now the situation is stable," she said.
Despite the fact that they have noted a victory of vital importance even though limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties for independence have fought to maintain their power of year, with many of their most famous leaders being self-defenced or held in expectation of their right to organise the resolution and the declaration of independence.
John Puts, a 42-year-old mechanical engineer, who recorded his cell phone demonstrations for the police, said that the conflicts were fed by politicians and the two armies.
"The intensity is getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Orion Zückera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were imprisoned last year, announced his invitation to the European Churches for the next year.
"My invitation to the European elections is the best way to complain about the deepening of democratic values and the pressure we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londoner: Catching men after car hire at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were gathered after a repeated car call to live in London.
The situation took place at Bolingard Crestend on Friday about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Bloomings said damages were caused in the floors and in the same building.
There may also be some kind of gunfire in the car at some point.
Menga's hit in Livingstone won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone was to win.
Previously on Livingstone, the Reingers had just met Steven Gerard in his second year of 18 games as manager of the Abrox team.
Dolly Menga's hit made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains unconquered outside the window this season and faces the Charters, which have eight degrees, the next Sunday.
Before this game, the Reingers host the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Friday.
Livingson in the middle continues to play her course in six games in her class, with the basic promulgator Holt not to have ever liked anything since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone loses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before it cuts, with her immediate ability to bring the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and stopped arriving shortly before the end, but Alan Lithcow gave up his effort to clear Cregg Halquet's head away from the end.
The farmers allowed the Rangers to play before them, knowing that they could chase visitors to the open fields and corners.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Reingers could not prevent a free strike and Livingstone opened the door, Declan Galacher and Robinson collaborated to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and pulled it from the center of the area.
Until that point, the Reingers had ruled the ball but found the land defence undisputed and the termite Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This form continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos removed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's old man was pulled out of Reingers Alan McGregor's termist's legs, and Lithkou's leg came out in another free shot at Livingstone.
A lot of casual passages were made in Livingstone's area, and they were constantly retreating, while two pints were asked - after the ball was fired by Halquet against the extra player Glen Mintelton and one for hand - which was rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingstone - analysis
Alexander Lamont from Scotland's BBC in the field of Tony McCarney Arena
Thematic performances and results for Livingstone.
All except, they were excellent, passing the waiters on this innocent path.
The style of the game and their personality changed at least after their return to top form, but the signs should also be given to Holt for the encouragement he gave to the team with his approach.
His team had so many heroes.
Captain Halquet was excellent, returning an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Ourell in custody throughout the game.
The Reingers were not inspired.
As good as they were in the past under the guidance of Gerard, they did not respond to these standards.
The last game was missing - only once they managed to pass the land defence, and this is a warning campaign for the Reingers, which is located in the middle of the class.
Anaemic feelings of acceptance of Erdogan in Colonia
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at a meeting of Turkish and German leaders for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's second visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO parties.
They had come in line with issues such as human rights, freedom of type and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Colonia to start a new terrible jam.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police shut down for security reasons the concentration of 25,000 people in front of the jam, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom are of Kurdish origin - have also given up now, judging both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German Government to welcome him into the country.
The silence of the speakers reveals the incompetence of a visitor who is treated by some Turks as heroes and others as dictators.
Tragic accident in Detford: death of a motorcycle after a car crash
A driver lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the turning-off of the Bested Street and Evelin Street roads, a very complicated road to Detford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the bus drivers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict was noted a few months after a similar situation in which a driver hit and killed a bike, which lost his life on the road to Cylinder Stritt, about 1.6 miles from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitical Police said the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
Roads have been closed and rail routes have been exhausted, while drivers have been instructed to leave the area.
Long Lartine Prisons: Six police were injured in complications
Six police officers have been tortured by disturbances in high-security men's prisons, in accordance with statements made by the Department of Prisons.
This Great Long Lardin prison was closed in the Ustershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been returned to deal with the disturbances involving eight detainees and who were shown in a party.
The police were exposed to micro-terrorism in the face during the complications.
A representative of the prisons said: "Specially trained staff managed to deal with the incident in the prisons of this Great Long Lardin.
Six members of the staff were diagnosed with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be accountable to the police authorities and may bring a greater penalty."
In the prisons of this Great Long Lartine, more than 500 prisoners are detained, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the prison administration was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the rehabilitating units were invited to the prison to report serious incidents during which members of the staff were subjected to a militarized attack.
Roza Typhoon is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City with sudden floods (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare a tropical earthquake to hit Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remains of the Roza Typhoon will divide the dreamiest parts of the summer by bringing floods into their past.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued an extensive warning message for the Second and Third Countries from West Arizona to the South and East Nevada, Southeastern California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flattaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Roza Typhoon is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will soon arrive on Tuesday with rain.
Fonix's National Meteorological Service pointed out to her tweet that "only ten tropical cycles have remained in a state of tropical drought or low barometers in less than 200 miles from Fonix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon in less than 40 miles away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Typhoon Centre provide for a flow rate of 2 to 4 inches, with a single flow rate of up to 6 inches in Mongolia Rim of Arizona.
In other regions of the South-West States, including the Central Barriers of the Oronas and the Great Basin, it is possible to detect floods of up to 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of isolated total rainfall up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not threatened by floods, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this phenomenon is expected to be positive, as the North American countries are experiencing drought conditions today.
According to the U.S. Health Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought," said weather.com.
First, the Russian Typhoon will reach the closet of the Mexican Handicraft Bay.
Keeping the focus of the piston, Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico at maximum speeds of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour speed.
The drought will find more colder water in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive at the beach in Mexico with an intense tropical breeze at the end of the evening or at the end of the afternoon.
An intense flooding can occur in regions of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches per inch from the Bay of California to the North Sonora, which is likely to reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Next, Rosa will be heading north through Mexico as a tropical drought again and will arrive at the Arizona border early on Wednesday morning as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Judah late on Wednesday night.
"The main risk expected by the Rosa Typhoon or the rest of it is the very intense flooding in the Bahamas of California, the North Sudan and the United States of America," said the U.S. National Typhoon Centre.
These floods are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and droughts in the plains and direction on the shores.
Exposure to Mintsomer Norton: Four arrests for post-mortem murder
Three hostages and a 20-year-old were gathered as suspects of human murder after the discovery of a 16-year-old who had suffered from sword wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in Mintsomer Norton's Exelsier Teras area, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
She was transferred to the hospital, where she remains in "firm" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old met during the night in the Rantock area, reported the police of Evon and Somerset.
The police are calling for anyone who can have recorded on the phone what happened.
Trab says that Kavano "lived the evil and the evil" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote of rejection of the free and outlawing rules of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trab said that Kavano "lived the evil and the evil" of the Democratic Party throughout its demonstration procedure as a candidate.
Kavano was sent to Congress on Friday, rejected charges and apparently mixed up with Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted ten years ago when she was leaving.
Ford also put before the audience for her claims.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Kavano on that day.
"The vote to confirm the candidateship of Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a law with an excellent public service," said the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President mentioned directly at the invitation of Kavano, speaking about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the inter-elections.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling all the way back to excellent candidates."
Trab mentioned that the Democrats are on "resistance and prevention" mission.
The first important procedural vote in Germany on the invitation to Cuba is expected to be taken by the country later on Friday, referred to the CNN's most helpful chairman of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people were killed by seismic and tsunamis in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were killed by giant storms that hit the coast when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia, the authorities declared the sun.
Hundreds of people had been assembled for a festival on the beach of the city again on Friday, when six - foot - high feet [6 m] peaked at the grave, turning many to death and destroying everything at their end.
The tsunami occurred after 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat for tsunamis was exposed yesterday, the world was still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Pourjo Nugrocho, representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster management service, informing Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, carjacked, wood, houses, hit everything in the stern," said Nugrocho, adding that the tsunami had travelled to the ocean at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people dug into the trees to get rid of the tsunami and grew up, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Paul.
Airfotos published by the disaster management service show many destroyed buildings and buildings, bridges that have been destroyed and destroyed and a roof that is surrounded by water.
The shipments continued to raid the coastal city on Saturday.
The stadiums became sensitive to a range of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the huge food chain was about 200 times greater than the power of the human bomb that fell in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow hill, can increase the size of the tsunami, mentioned.
New York described the damage as "extended" and said that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He noted that numerous victims were found trapped under the walls of damaged buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were neglected.
New York said that the victims and injuries may be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Paul in a region called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the scene.
The communication systems "have completely disappeared and there is no information" from Dongkala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said Erythros Stairs in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already about a tragedy and it can worsen," he said.
He was critical of the Service on the Sabbath because he did not report that the tsunami had hit Paul, although according to the officials, the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a technical video that was announced on social media, a man on the roof of a building is listening to shouting panic while trying to warn people down the street about the tsunami coming.
In just a few minutes, a piece of water goes up into the coast, crossing houses and cars.
The Reuters workshop was not able to check the video's flexibility immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great wave of floods, which also stopped communications in Paul’s wider area, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The army began to send transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the exposed continue to need undisputed food and other basic types of first need.
The city airport opened again just to contribute to the healing efforts and will remain closed until October.
It has been scheduled to visit President Jack Woodonto at the training centres in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongkala managed to arrive safely in the city of Paul, where workers found refuge in caves at the front of their office, passed through disaster scenes on their way, said Mr. Dosemba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some health groups have taken up the heavy duty to initiate the relief process, some complain that they have not allowed foreign workers, especially experienced workers in the relief sector, to travel to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of interest is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at the level of origin," said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Stargate.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can address an international aid application, but there is no relevant decision yet."
As the second day passed in Paul after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family who continue to be ignored still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less
On Saturday, a little boy was kidnapped by a name.
On Sunday, nurses released a woman who had been kidnapped under two days of torture, along with her mother's dead body.
Ghenton Subantono, the founder of the national team of the Indonesian electoral team, had trained two of the neglected explorers for the Asian Agonists, who were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mantaji, were his students.
"As an old man at the end of the elective side, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Ghenton was told how, when the news about the formation of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of the electoral community, he began sending excited messages WhatsApp sent to his opponents at Paul's party on the beach.
However, the indication next to his messages was a Greek symbol "n", rather than two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The robbers dropped $26,750 when the automatic take-off machine was deployed in Newport de Levi.
On Friday morning, robbers dropped $26,750 from a Brink's staff who had been using an ATM machine in Newport and Levi, according to a news item of the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had thrown an ATM machine into the respiratory system and was preparing to deliver other money, mentioned in the report by police officer Dennis Macarty.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the report, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the event.
Any person who has information about their identity should contact Newport's police, calling for 859-292-3680.
Make West: The rapper changes his name to Ya
Captain Kanie West changes his name to Yae.
Noting the change on Twitter on the Sabbath, he wrote: "The one who is knowingly known as the Canyon West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening here for a long time to the Buddhist Son and has used this fake name as a title for his album, which circled June.
The change was preceded by his appearance at the Saturday Night Live exhibition, where he is expected to present his new album entitled Yandhi.
In contrast to the exhibition, the singer Ariana Grante, who canceled her appearance as "sympathetic reasons", as stated by the founder of the show.
In addition to being a summary of the professional name he is using today, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you," said West last year in a discussion on his album title with the Big Boy Radio producer.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanya, which means "the only one" to Ya, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the miserable ourselves, of all things.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the many distinguished rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Pope Dandy, P. D.D. or D.D., but he announced a year that he preferred the names Lav and Brader Lav.
An ex-West associate, TZEJ-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without letters and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico swears he will not use the army against the citizens
Mexico's elected President, Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador, said he would never use military violence against citizens, as the country is approaching the 50th year of a massive schoolhouse.
Lopez Obrador was promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolko Plaza Square that "he will never use the army to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful movement in the square, killing 300 people, during a period where the left-wing academic movements took risks throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador was committed to supporting the new Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities lead young people to criminal contracts.
The United States should double funding for technical intelligence
As China is more active in the intelligence sector, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, says the investor and professional in the intelligence sector, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This speech is to be added to various parts of the U.S. government's communication on technical intelligence, since the US does not have an official strategy for technical intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China has recently presented its plan to become the first country in the world in innovation in matters of intellectual engineering by 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget for technical intelligence would be a good principle, since all other countries are left so much behind in the United States and we are striving to make the next important discovery in the field of technical intelligence," Li said.
The duplication of the budget could double the chances of taking a country to the United States the next major achievement in the field of intelligence, Li said at his meeting at the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was circulated this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who has invested in one of China's top intelligence companies, Facebook++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a intelligence engineering system that won the best American player Otello, while later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Annex to China.
Lee recognized the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the R & D R Initiative (DARPA), and discussed when the next event would take place in order to identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants, Li said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academia, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired university licenses to work on intellectual engineering issues in recent years.
Li argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to support its efforts in the field of intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be offered automatically to teachers in the technical sense," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next-Gen Finance Engineer in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
A year ago, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre for Finance Engineers, which would consist of partners from the business and academic world, and White House announced the formation of an Electoral Commission on the Technology.
That month, DARPA announced an investment of up to two thirds of dollars in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Institute of Sciences invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of intelligence.
In the meantime, no progress has been made here and for months in the legislation of the United States with a view to creating a National Security Commission for the Motorcycle.
The citizens of the GDR are acting in a resolution to decide whether to change the name of the country
The people of the GDR participated in a resolution on Sunday to decide whether the country would become part of the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that would bring about a ten-year conflict with Greece which had blocked the country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has jurisdiction over the name Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a decree on its territory and has acted as a bet on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change will undermine the national identity of the slave majority of the GDR population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the resolution and a mpoikotaz army has created doubts as to whether participation will reach the required 50 percent to be true.
The question on the voter was: "You are in favour of NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece".
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaef, argue that it is a price worth paying to promote the integration of such organizations as the EU and NATO for the MDGs, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the IDP's young people can live freely under the European Union's umbrella, because this will make our lives safer for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of the House have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote in order to become final.
A majority of two-thirds of the Parliament is required to change the name.
The National Electoral Committee stated that there were no reports of abuses up to 1 m.
However, participation reached only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it gave 66 per cent of the votes cast.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said 62-year-old Joe Tanevski, a voter in the presidential office, the Skopje.
PMM Prime Minister Zoraf Zaef, Zorika's wife and son Dusko voted in the resolution on the change in the name of the country that would open the way for the country's entry into NATO and the European Union to the city of Strumica of Strumica of WFP on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Cavardkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes that have been set up by those who will shape the resolution.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to compete with the top head, not as a second-class partner," Kavardkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become members of the vast Union."
Prime Minister Zaef said NATO's integration will result in numerous investments in GDP, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe that the tax majority will be good, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaef said after he voted.
He mentioned that a positive outcome would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a statement published last Tuesday by the Institute of Political Studies of the DPRK, the resolution would involve from 30 to 43 per cent of the votes, i.e. less of the required participation.
According to another survey conducted by the PDJ's Telma TV television station, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said it would vote positively.
In order for the resolution to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent together with one vote.
If the resolution fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policies of the democratic government since its fall in power last May.
Follow up: Sherhio Aguro of Manchester City crosses the entire defense of Briton to put Google
Serchio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were the defense of Briton by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Ethan Steadium in Manchester, England.
Aguro showed up to jump easily at the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker took place in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Briton's defenses before he left for the open place.
As a result, Aguro was found surrounded by four green players.
He passed by a security guard, leaving behind a few others at the end of Briton's vast area.
Then he walked on his left, finding Sterling.
English Fortord made his first move back to the region by returning the ball to Agure, which used his right foot to win Briton Matthew Ryan's termite prison, cutting to the right side of the nets.
"Agurero is facing some problems on his feet," Citi's promoter, Pep Guardioola, told reporters.
"We told him to play 55 with 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky that Google hit her at the time."
However, Sterling was the one who gave the French the initial advantage in Premier Lig's fight.
That's it. That's the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Briton's area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful old man along the left side of Liroy Sane.
Shane kept the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back dock.
The glass oven closed the ball on the network a little before it got out.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the groups of Chabion Lig on Tuesday at 12:55 m. in the Rein-Necar Arena area in Cinseim, Germany.
Sergeer wants to win the Rockies.
Since the Nisionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason for him to try to make another start.
But always competitive Serger hopes to play the Day against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they continue to have effects on the Rockies on the pley-offs, as they are preceded by a game of Los Angeles Dozers in Nasional Lig West.
The Rockies have passed their winnings 5-2 against the Nasionals on Friday night, but they still want to lock their first place in their class.
"Although we don't have anything to win, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denmark with the popes and the other group will be a potential game of the highest level I will face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in such a fight?"
The Nasionals have not yet reported who will be the original match on Sunday, but it is said they're trying to let Sergeer take off the ball.
Sherzer, who will make his 34th start, has made preparations for Friday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right hand from Washington has 18-7 with average score (ERA) 2,53 and 300 Ut due to strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trab makes a speech in West Virginia
The President mentioned immediately the situation regarding his elected candidate for Supreme Court Brit Kavano in his speech on the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-elections.
"All we've done is bet on November.
We miss five weeks from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment, but I am not a candidate, but in fact it's like I am and, therefore, I travel all the way to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trab went on to say: "You see this joke, this ethnic group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power using any necessary means.
They don't care who hurt, who have to rely to get power and control, because what they want is power and control and we won't give them."
The Democrats, mentioned above, have taken the mission of "resistance and prevention".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, identifying the Democrats as "frust and angry and mean, stupid and lying."
He referred to the Justice Commission of Georgia by making nameful remarks to the President of the Republic of Denmark Fantain, a report that was accepted by the public with possible experiences.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you cover up the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. This was a really bad use of the body's language, the worst use of the body's language I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a broad range.
It is not insensitive to those who express their opinion
It didn't surprise me that Momentum movement activists in my local team voted to make me a spy.
In addition, I am the last of a number of members of the Working Party who said they were not welcome, just because we say so.
My fellow MEP John Ryan had a similar attitude because he was firmly opposed to anti-emergency.
In my case, my motion for a resolution was made critical because I argued with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, in general, for similar issues with which Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The invitation to the South-West Labour Conference on Friday stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with the participation of all".
In most of the eight years I am a local Labour Member, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more flexible, more coherent" policy has been forgotten here and for a long time, if it has never really started to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that the different views are not being taken into account in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable under the leadership of the Party.
This began a little after Jeremy became President, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 parties and adopt views that I would never agree with, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I really said, I heard a poll in the media, where some asked for my resignation, rejected the policy of the centre and told me that I should not be a member of the Working Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I am happier than my other colleagues, since the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racist attacks every day, but they never give up.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this time in politics is how the attacks are now viewed as more regular.
Jeremy Corbin confirmed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of impartiality.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad extension and that by any proposal for a resolution or change of the rules of choice, the limits of the section are closer.
I've been advised by many over the past two years not to raise one another, not to talk too much and so "all will be fine".
But I didn't get into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the delay shown by the Government of Thacher, which led by the majority in the failure of my entire class, my goal was to provide better public services for those who need them more, whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I never hid my policy, and I did the same in the last elections.
No one in the South East could have been confused in any way with my political views and points of concern to today's leadership.
To those who have promoted the proposal for a ban on Friday, I only have to say that while the country comes in line with a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on whether I am a member of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, my only message is not addressed to members of the Momentum movement in South Vietnam, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political objectivity will prevent me from acting as I believe it is for the best interests of all of you.

Air - Melrouz: 38 - 17: The innocent Air passes to the top
Two late golls may have disturbed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ireland was worth fighting for this extremely psychotropic today's Tend campaign.
It's now at the top of the class, the only innocent group of ten.
Finally, it was her best defense, as well as the best exploitation of the opportunities, which took place in favor of the farmers, and the promoter Peter Murtzy had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tried our games so far and we're still honest, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous said, "Thank you to Ireland, the opportunities have been better than we are."
Grant Anderson's gol at the 14th minute, with the conversion of Fraser Climo, brought Ireland forward, but a secret card to Scotszeo Rory Houges, who was committed to the game by the Wayers, allowed Melrous to exercise the digital advantage and Jason Bagcott noted a gol without conversion.
Klimo has increased Air's advance with peneldi before cutting, just in the mid-term, a Google with a change, leading Air to a 17-5 score slot.
But Melrouz started the second half-year good and Patrick Anderson's gol, with Bagcott's conversion, reduced the advance to five degrees.
There was a long-term expectation because of a serious injury caused by Rurid Not, which was removed by a body, and after re-initiation, Ireland increased the difference with one of Staffford McDouale's coal, with climate change.
The additional leader, Blair Macerson, took the following card, and Melrous once again exploited the digital advantage of Bruce Colvin's glass without conversion, after a long period of intense pressure.
The peasants returned, however, and when Strawan Hasinson took a train ticket to Climate without the ball from the plane line, Macerson pointed Google at the back of the attack that Iir carried out.
The climate has changed, as it has been almost since the rebooting, since Kyle Rowe first took David Armstrong's lock and sent the extra Gregor Henry away for the fifth floor floor.
Still Game's competitors start a new career at the station
The champion of the Still Game Ford Kiernan series is ready to move to the station after it has been found to be appointed as director of an approved restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's public exhibition, which he writes and which he is in line with here and his annual partner in the Greek Hebfield code.
The couple announced that the next five round would be the last of the show and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Geggland.
According to the official records, he is the director of the company Aunjimorn Limited.
The actor refused to study the information, although the source of Scottish Sun was assumed that Kiernan wanted to engage with the "distorting station" in Glaskov.
"The sea is our own": The Bolivian hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The ships are on board at the fully equipped shipyard in La Paz.
In public buildings, they're wearing ice marks.
On the basis of the ship from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the sign is written: "Our sea is legally owned.
It's our duty to take it back."
Throughout the region of central Bolivia, the memory of the Octogram that Hille acquired after a dramatic confrontation on the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as is the legacy of its people to travel to the Pacific for once more.
These hopes have been expressed today more than ever, here and for decades, as Bolivia looks forward to the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and peace, and naturally awaits the outcome with positive eyes," said Roberto Calzandilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the issue of the decision of the International Court of Justice in large numbers throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of the Bolivian decision to force Chile, after decades of talks, to negotiate for the granting of a government exit to the sea in Bolivia.
Evo Moralas, the gratitudeary Vice-President of Bolivia, who gives a twofold fight for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from the decision of the Second.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," was promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide for Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to provide thousands of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is to be issued only six months after the final undertakings have been present shows that the case was "not too complex", said Paz Zarate, a Millennium Special in International Law.
And instead of further promoting the goals of Bolivia, the past quarter may have underestimated them.
"The present-day Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Moralas' offensive rhetoric has taken over every subsequent good provision of Hillis, he supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not changed their accession since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wellgee, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the procedure for issuing the decision of the court was urgent.
On Tuesday, Bolivia will have "a great opportunity to establish a new era of relations with Hille" and the possibility of "finally end up in 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzandila also refused that Moralas, who is still one of the most popular leaders of Latin America, uses the issue of the exit to the sea as a political decadence.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons if it cannot be trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his state will never withdraw its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United States.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two States.
Rey made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pobeo seems ready to resume the nuclear diplomacy that had ended three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Young won.
Ri says that the view that continued sanctions and the refusal of the United States to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point require the North to "run" is a dream of a long night.
Washington wishes to agree to issue the related declaration if Piongyang does not make the first major arms movements.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trab want a second summit.
But there is a broad view of whether Pinging is seriously thinking of declaring an armament which the country considers likely to be the only means to guarantee its safety.
Popbeo plans to visit Pinging next month to prepare for a second summit at Kim-Trab.
The exhibitions of Paris fashion reveal the latest trends in overcrowded capillaries that will soon be available on some site near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented in Pasarela a series of other super-mechanical capillaries for the collection of the Open-Calocari 2019 which stole the performance on the Moda Week in Paris.
Excellent apple hats cut through Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the bakery.
The piece that separated from Valentino was a supervolcanic piece of paper covered with a plate can cover the entire head of the models.
Among other excess acids were carpussed with metals, a capillary, even a breath, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, over the clock for Halloween.
Many of the multi-chromed masks had cut wires and crossed more into Hannibal Lecter than in high rapture mode.
One creation led to a new full-fledged equipment with breath and glass, while another looked like a wet bed in a hole.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with great accents, you're lucky.
Stylists provide that these huge hats could reach central shopping streets near you.
The overcrowded hats made their appearance very quickly after the "La Boba", the search hat with too many sides we can see wearing so many, from Riana to Emily Rataivsky.
The public company that created the excellent apple hat that has destroyed the media of the social network has also sent another great creation to the Pasharela, a search for sand dunes almost as large as the model that pushes it through its magic.
The dark Portuguese bag of raffles, decorated with raffles and a white leather cup, was the piece that separated from the La Riviera Open-Calocchiari 2019 collection of Jacquemus in the Moda Week in Paris.
The pressman Luke Armitaz said to the FEMAIL column: "I expect to see large hats and large sea bags in the shopping malls next Friday, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overcrowded steel."
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic achievement, which continued in 2018, with a number of outstanding results in the examinations, which have simply been enhanced by more than individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Council of Scotland (SCIS), are striving to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for future and higher education levels, the career course they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school programme of studies by order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela had said: "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, then what you say goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder to him that we cannot simply base ourselves on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of fetin studies, we find that languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who were learning foreign languages reached a degree of absolute A.
Studies compiled by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved A degree in literacy in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also had A degree.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as an election lesson, are considered equally important with science, technology, mechanical and educational learning programmes of independent schools and others.
A study by the Employment and Skills Commission of the EU in 2014 found that, with regard to the reasons for which workers were finding it difficult to cover job vacancies, a percentage of the 17 per cent category involved lack of language skills.
The need for linguistic skills is therefore becoming increasingly attractive so that young people are ready for their future career career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career anyone will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that he can value throughout his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will benefit from competition.
According to a study by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the EU in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a discussion, while French was the only language that spoke a bilingual proportion of respondents (15 percent).
That is why investment in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing many languages, especially the languages of the developed economies, will give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the EB since 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from independent schools, which have an expert teaching staff in this field.
The independent schools of Scotland offer with determination a educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
No one can deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and tolerance for young people in Scotland.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland.
Lebron's gonna make his Debtors Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of the friends who will never see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers came almost to its end.
Lakes Luke Walton's promoter announced that James will play Sunday in the first game before the game against the Daver Naggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Truwell wrote on Twitter that James might be playing for a few minutes.
After the proposal a few days ago, James was asked about his plans regarding the program of six games to be given by Lakers before the competitive period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trab's concentration in West Virginia, Canaly YouTube
President Donald Trab starts a series of conferences beginning with Wiling in West Virginia.
This is for the first of five scheduled meetings of Trab next week, which includes circuits in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
By confirming his election for the Supreme Court to be held in expectation, Trab seeks to strengthen popular support for the upcoming media elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia last night and how can you watch it online?
The Trab concentration in Wiling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 μm ET night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can monitor the concentration of Trab in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trab is likely to be referred to in this week's hearings for an application for a position in the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanno, which took place in a closed atmosphere due to allegations of sexual incidents, with a confirmed vote by Georgia which has been pending for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of conferences is to help the Republicans who face double entry into November's elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, the end of President Trab's mission said that these five summits next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the votes they have in Georgia and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so critical for its agent, which the president travels to as many states as possible, as we travel through the vast period of the military," said the Reuters representative of the Trab army, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The scheduled evening meeting at Wesbanco Arena of Willing could bring supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News newspaper.
The Sabbath will be the second time in the month that Trab visits West Virginia, the country which won more than 40 percent of the units in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate of the Republicans in West Virginia for Georgia, which is low in the budgets.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisie that the president must come and try to encourage him to fight," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the chance to compete with the hope alive as it leads to the singles of the Sun
After three single games, Saturday's squares might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talent of the race is a fully understood athletic idea, but the players believe it seriously, especially in such amerations.
Where would they say there's the storm now?
"There were six degrees ahead and now it's four, so maybe we have a small wave," Jordan Speth said as he retired for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, to move forward with four degrees and remain twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Smith says, feel "air on their shoulders" and have much to encourage them, such as the great Smith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and everyone missed three degrees of four.
Speth was mortal from tea to green and gives an example.
The sound of the shootings became more powerful as he continued around him, making a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were under two after two.
The hit that won the game at the 15th was accompanied by appropriate punitives showing his conviction that the American team is not outside.
"You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game," Speth said.
It's what each player has left.
18 prints to write a story.
The only players with more degrees than the Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Franz Molynari and Tommy Fletgood, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but valuable treasure of Europe has won four out of four and it seems to be nothing wrong.
The "Moligud" was only the cloud that didn't hit bogey on Saturday evening, but also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday evening and back snow on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way that energy seems to fall to and from the horrored fans, ensures that they are players who should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Floyd or Molinari to defeat a possible European win while the sun goes over Le Golf National.
In preference to the two at the same time in different forms.
The debate on the European dossier is still ahead of time.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the glasses on Serdio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Norden.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front of snow they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
The Sun, however, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so interesting games to monitor them closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can change for a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has an important precedent on the last day, but this foursome game has also shown that the US team has the cats, despite some doubts.
Europe takes over 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after four-balls and four-weeks with 10-6 against the US.
The inspired team of Tommy Floyd and Francesco Molinari formed two wins at a contestant Tiger Guts and was able to take the lead in Le Golf National until now at four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Bourne, which is trying to keep the way he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the American side in the morning fourballs, with a series of 3-1.
The U.S. were more opposed to foursomes, winning two matches, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Forrick's side needs eight degrees from the 12 single matches of the sun to keep the way.
Floyd is the first new European player to win four ranks, and together with Molinari, known as "Moligud", after a coincidental Saturday is only the second winning four levels in the first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
With Junts and Patrick Reid in the Fourballs, they combined their powers to defeat a brave Junts and American newly-founded Braceon DeSabo with an even more impressive 57-4.
Guts, who was involved in the two games on Saturday, showed a state-of-the-art flash of light, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who was relieved for the morning fourballs, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner for the foursomes with 2&1 at the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cape, gaining the first and third position in the world ranking.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the happy, sunny day in Paris.
Three times the winner Jordan Spice and Justin Thomas set the go for the Americans twice a week.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory on the John Ram and Ian Polter of Spain in the fourballs and later returned to win the Poulter and Rory McKilroy 47-3 in the foursomes while they lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history a group could find out when it had four degrees in the singles, although since it is the transformer, Forrick is enough to succeed in saving the way.
However, after it was found in second place for two days, it appears that a solar eclipse is beyond their ability.
North Korea says it's not going to be left alone without confidence measures.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on the Sabbath that continued sanctions are disturbing the US and that his country will not at least leave its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Young Ho said at the annual World Agency General Meeting that North Korea had taken "significant good will measures" last year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the explanation of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way to begin our weaponry at least."
While Ri has repeated known opposition from North Korea to Washington's resistance to a possible "static" approach to detonation, according to which North Korea will be attacked as a step-by-step in the process, his statement was important as it did not completely exclude the mononomial detonation, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri was mentioned in the joint communiqué of Kim Young One and Donald Tramb at the first summit he took to the country between an energy leader of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim was promised to work for the "irrigation of the Korean peninsula", while Tramb was promised security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pinging must first "give" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also faced calls for the reduction of the severe international sanctions that have been imposed in North Korea.
"The United States is trying to become "the first decommissioning" and increase pressure by threatening to achieve their purpose by issuing even obstacles to the "war's end", said Rei.
"The assumption that sanctions can be born to us is a dream that we don't know.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are causing us distress."
Rei made no reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the U.S. leader referred to the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister, however, held three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun JJ in the last five months and added: "If the partner in the question of decommissioning was South Korea and not the United States, the decommissioning of Korean leadership would not have reached such an end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the U.S. country's presence with North Korea's ballistic guns was inevitable because the "Bad President" Trab called Kim "Pyrilanman" on a suicide mission.
A year in the United Nations, Trab, which threatened yesterday to "disappear completely" North Korea, surprised Kim’s courage to move forward with the arms measures, but said that more must be done and that the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is reinvigorated.
On Tuesday, Trab said he didn't have a schedule for this, saying, "If they need two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should reward Pinging for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Popbeo told the UN Security Council on Friday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue inexorably and unconditionally until full, final and confirmed abolition is achieved".
The Security Council approved, in accordance with the 2006 sanctions for North Korea, an effort to finance Pinging's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Popbeo met Ri at the U.S. General Conference and then announced that he would visit Pinging next month to prepare for a second summit.
Poppeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip wasn't going well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, so that North Korea would complain to him a few hours later that he had "the requirements of a gangster".
North Korea committed itself to meeting with Moon this month to abolish a nuclear facility and also a nuclear compound if the United States took "relevant measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he sought were security assurances that Trab had been promised to Singapore and were promoting the development of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow lessons on how to get enough rest
Last year, a new study at Harvard University encourages all prospective students to sleep more in an effort to combat the increased soft culture of the entire night study with the use of a lot of caffeine.
One academic found that students at the 1st university in the world often do not know basic things, e.g. how to care for themselves.
Charles Xishler, professor of the Irish Academy of Harvard and a specialist doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the study, which he believes is his first type in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the study after a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on the study.
"At the end, a girl came and said to me, "Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he said in The Telegraph.
The study, which started for the first time a year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performances, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of medicine at Harvard's Irish School and executive director of the health services of the university, said that the university decided to include the study when it was found that students were asleep within a week at an important level.
The final study includes a series of interactive work.
In one unit there is a picture of a student sitting where students click on flakes of coffee, Kurtins, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports effects are affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routine.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of stroke, headache, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the student's behaviour immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health implications when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chisler.
Its culture is becoming popular because you've been studying all night, he said, adding that modern technology and continuous pressure on students means that sleep burning is a problem that is being digested.
The enough sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep throws the brain into a lymphatic condition, resulting in a constant feeling of pain.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Charlesler to design the study, following one of his first classes in Harvard.
He said his study opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a study throughout the university.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all developing students to follow a similar program before they start their studies in this particular competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised students to set up a notification for the time they should go to sleep, as well as a wake-up computer, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" produced by electronic waves and light LEDs, which can harm the circular flow by leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone - Reingers 1-0: Menga puts Google on Gerard's men
The Reingers were another wild cat out of the seat, as Dolly Mengka's suit led by Steven Gerard's side of the cat with 1-0 in Livingstone.
Abrux's team sought to mark the first win from the February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstown, but Gary Holt's team had just launched Gerard's second eight in 18 games as a promoter, leaving the eight-level team behind the Charter, which is the first in the listing of the Ladbrokes initiative.
Menga hit seven minutes before the afternoon, and Reinger's renewed russian russian russian crater seemed unresponsive.
While Reingers is now on the sixth floor, Livingstone is heading down to the third floor, with only a cool difference from the former Hibernian.
And Reingers can expect other customers, as the late Calum Spence needed to get first aid for injury to the head caused by an object that was stolen from the scene.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and disappointed Er in the media for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Levi 11" composition that took a degree from Hart last week and would be happy to see how this so-called machine could break every effort of the opponents.
Reingers may have ruled the owner, but Livingson did more with the ball.
He should've checked in the second minute when Menga's first remote pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the middle didn't find the ball.
A large free suit by Kegan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but the only person who could do was send the ball away from the dock.
Reingers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last three years.
Alfredo Morelos must have believed he should have won a medal at the 15th, since he fought with Steven Loules, but the poet Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian attacks.
Reingers had only two shots in the area in the first half of the year, but Abrux's former termite, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all about the head of Lasana Kulimbali and Ovy Ezeria's subsoil.
Although Levi was clearly below the expectations in the first 34 minutes of the battle, no one can deny that he deserved the victory for the effort and only.
And Reingers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem again.
Scott Armfield didn't respond when Declan Galacher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his spirit and found Menga who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the middle of the day by getting out of Kulimbali and based on Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediate, as the extreme hit the ball in Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block it.
Livingstone, however, continued to discourage those who are interested in the style of the game that he knows and enjoys, with the Lithuanians and Halquets to remove one far away from the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but MacGregor faced Jacob's rivals, stopping him before Lithco's attempt at the corner.
Reinger's complement, Glen Middleton, had another stage for penniless at the end, since he had argued with Jacobs, but Tomson also ignored it.
Almanac: Güger's meter's fan
A page from the German Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: as today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day in Germany was born the future natural man Johann Wilhelm "Hance" Gaiger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the device known as the Geiger meter.
As a result of the scientific revolution, Medieval Geiger passed through the sphere of the pop culture, such as in a 1950 movie entitled Bells of Coronado, with protagonists of the amazing Cuban scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andre: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive metal elements such as uranium.
When you turn these earphones, listen to the action of the people who are caused by the radiation in metal elements."
You said, "Look, it's crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the statement bearing his name continues its work.
New anticarcinal vaccine teaches the injector to "see" the problem cells
A new anticarcinal vaccine teaches the injector to "see" the problem cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the injector to identify the problem cells during treatment
The method includes the export of unoscothets from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common in various types of cancer and continues to be re-injected
An under-tested vaccine has a promising effect on patients with various cancer types.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells has seen the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of unoscothets from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then the re-injection of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the U.S. National Institute of Carcinium in Bessetda, Maryland, said: "The results prove that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explains, the HER2 protein "makes the engine powerful for developing enough types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, spirits and old internal cancer.
A similar approach to which non-insectors are exported from patients and then "instructed" how to target cancer cells has been used for the treatment of a type of anaemia.
Kanie West was raped by Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA signal, after he showed up at SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West was admitted to the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an alternative meeting held by US President Donald Trabb and said he would be a candidate for the 2020 elections.
After the third song for the night, entitled Ghost Town, he wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again (to re-do American Studies), gave a prescription against the Democrats and reiterated his support to Trab.
"I talk to someone white and he says, "How do you like Trab? He's racist."
If I were worried about racism, I would have left America here for a long time," he said.
The SNL opened with a piece where Matt Damon, with Hollywood's star, filed Bret Kavano's case before the Georgia Court of Justice on Christine Blazi Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it hasn't been translated, the video with West's completion appeared on social media from the Cris Rock comic book.
It's not clear if Rock tried to get West off with this addiction.
West also argued in public that he was not treated well in the performances because of his hat.
"They made me bulging in the plays.
They said, "Don't get out of the hat."
They made me a Bulling!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what's going on with me?
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by the public, and SNL's factors appeared to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with one person saying in the newspaper: "The whole studio kept a nervous breakdown".
West was called a replacement for the last time of the song by the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, had survived a few days earlier.
West beat enough when he sang I Love It dressed as Perrier's butt.
West supported Kantas Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who pointed out: "To one of the most dismal spirits: IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE ANTI-STATHATHICS IN HOCHLO."
However, the show's presentation, Karen Hunter, pointed out that West was just "his own and that's great".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") whom I think he is interfering with and promoting an idea that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We're the same," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it's already "the one that was previously known as Canyon West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Denny's steps, also known as Paf Dandy, Puffy and P. Denny.
Rector Snow Dog had changed his name to Snow Lion and of course the music trolle had changed his first name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formily Know As Prince.
Category of death penalty for assault with swords in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old was charged with murder after an assault on a man at a restaurant in East Belfast in Paris.
The situation in Balikamor, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast First Chamber on Tuesday.
The categories will be investigated by the Gospel.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harington's Star, criticises toxic relativity
Kit Harington is known for his role in the violent mid-morning series of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, 31-year-old actor describes the stereotype of mass heroes, saying that such roles in the drama are passed on to young boys the message that they should be strong enough to win respect.
Speaking in the newspaper The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something goes wrong" and explained how to combat the problem of toxic arrhythmia during #MeToo.
O Kit, who recently married his competitor at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, was admitted to have a "strong view" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake with boredom?" he said.
"What do we learn from men as they grow, about the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic arsenic susceptibility due to the arrhythmias promoted.
He continued: "What is planted and what is taught?
What does it teach on television and on the streets, making young men feel that they must show such a attitude in order to be men?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time.
Certainly something has gone wrong with our young people."
At the meeting he also agreed that he did not intend to play at any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series the next Friday, saying "end of battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will be in the forefront of the resurgence of the work True West of Sam Separd, which leaves the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a novelist.
The actor recently discovered that his knowledge with Rose's husband was the best he had since the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so somehow my future family and my life from here to beyond," she said.
Rose was supported by the Gritt, John Snow's beloved friend, the character that Kit supports in Emmy's series.
The couple married in June 2018 to Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new situations
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were some 40,000 new challenges reported.
In most cases, new problems have been transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly to certain parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost decreased, as health officials in China had said at a meeting in the province of June.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOT community of China.
Homophilophilia was certified in China in 1997, but Community-wide differences in the weight of LOT remain common.
Because of the country's conservation values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual contact with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicines in the context of the effort to address the problem.
Maxin Waters has lied that the thief has corrupted data from the Republican seniors, condemns "hazardous lies" and "counsel views"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxin Waters challenged the claims that a member of her staff published personal information from three Republican seniors on the pages of the legislation.
The President of the Republic of Los Angeles argued that the applications were promoted by students and websites of the "right-wing".
"False lies, lies and even more horrible lies," Waters said in her statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the address and telephone numbers of seniors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatz of Juta.
The information appeared on Friday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill's environment during the hearing of the Committee of Georgia on sexual harassment complaints against the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano.
The delay took place some time after the three elders had identified Kavano.
Conservative Web site, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, said that the IP address identifying the source of entries was related to the Waters Office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill said.
"This baseless claim is completely sudden and overbearing lies," Walters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these debts and false claims, was not in any case responsible for the spread of these information.
This absurd claim is completely sudden and uncooling lie."
Walter's statement received rapid criticism on the Internet, among others from former White House Press writer Ari Flescher.
"This statement is full of anger, Flesser wrote.
"This shows that he has no intention of being a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be a trick.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Flester appeared to compare Walter's reaction with the criticism of the Democratics for Judge Kavano, who was accused by his critics of being very angry at the hearing of Friday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate for the Republicans who seeks to intimidate Walters in the media elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he said.
In her statement, Walters stated that her office had notified "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false charges".
"We will do everything to find the responsible," he continued, "and inform them of all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff."
Critic of the movie Johnny English Žanachtupa - a subtle design film with Rowan Atkinson
It's more than a tradition to look for Brexit's brands in every new movie with a British character, and this seems to apply to this awakening of the franchise of acting-commodity movies with heroes Johnny Ingles, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and replayed in 2011 with Johnny English: Return.
Can this chimory car about how obvious damage we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the innocent Johnny Ingleis with the curious eyes could renew his permission to make them monsters for a second time. His name says it's a wider comical creation designed for non-english cinematographic actors.
It's of course for the admiring secret actors who, while claiming to have the catch and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clauso, with a dose from "Mr. Bin" and something from the guy who only played one and only notes on the music theme of the film The streets of Light at the end of the 2012 Olympic Games.
It is also based on the traveling and international mystery man who once supported Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten television ads, spreading the loss at his end.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this last JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingleis approached a helicopter dressed in a middle-armed gun and the giants hit his skull.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, the smile is quite subtle and unusual, especially at the time when "serious" cinematographic franchise such as the 007 and Dangerous Mission contain more comical details.
The smile seems to be directed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, Johnny Ingles' crazy inventions are not as obvious and related as those of Atkinson's film-type boots for Bin's transition.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A government hacker has launched the UK's super secret network, issuing out of the tax the identity of all Britain's agents on mission, to the great disappointment of the worker in service, supported by Kevin Elton in a very small role for his well-being.
It is the last stage for a bottom-up and friendly prime minister who is in favour of training because of political intolerance: Emma Thompson does what is best with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her in particular.
Information consultants inform her that, as each active survey has been discovered, it should bring back someone armed.
And that means Johnny Ingleis, who works more as a director at a university in a state-of-the-art school, but gives unexplained lessons about mysterious actors: there are some beautiful scenes here, as England offers an academic map of a School of Great Rock.
Ingleis is returning to Whitehole for urgent information and is reunited with Buff's former and late associate, who is also supported by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a vice president, a crazy role in which Vicki Perdin is not fully appreciated.
So Batman and Robin of the ship for the Secret Service of This Greatness are returning to action, meeting the beautiful and part of Ophelia Bouletova, supported by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is at risk of the generous billions of technology claimed to be able to solve Britain's technological debt: dangerous Jason Volta, supported by Jake Lesis.
Ingleis and Buff are beginning to travel their parishioners: transferred as waiters, set fires in a flat French restaurant, cause noise as they try to pass illegal names on Volta's beautiful tastes, and England causes beginnings as she tries to use an iconic reality device to be equipped with the interior of Volta's home.
All balls are used in this last scene, but as valuable and fashionable and, if it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
Measuring things.
And as with the other movies Johnny English I wonder: can't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will really play with his talent?
The Workers suspect that they are considering a plan to work for four days, but to pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Working Party is going to consider a racist plan to work for the British four days a week, but to be paid for five-day work.
The section, according to information, encourages the heads of companies to manage the savings achieved through the restoration of the technical intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them an additional day of freedom.
Thus, workers will enjoy a third day of the week, without any reduction in their salary.
Sources report that the idea coincides with the economic agenda and the plans of the section in order to return the couple to the workers.
The change in four-day week was approved by the Conference of Working Groups as a way of benefiting workers from the translated economy.
Another source from the Labour Party stated in The Sunday Times: "A change of policy is expected before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one night, but the four-day week of work is a commitment that is reflected in the approach of the section to reassess the economy for the workers, as well as the overall strategy of the section for industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party was promised a four-day working week in its general pre-election in 2017.
However, this view is not currently supported by the entire Working Party.
A representative of the Working Party said: "The fourth working week is not a party policy and is not examined by the party".
The author of the government scandal, John McDonel, used the workshop last week to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
MacDonel stated that he was determined to regain power from "representative directors" and "creditors" to joint benefit companies.
The plans of the Heads of Government also mean that today's participants in the investment companies may not take their full share back, as a powerful government of the Workers could make "retentions" due to alleged failures.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in the management councils of companies and to create joint venture capital in order to provide 10% of private sector companies with employees who will receive annual shares of up to 500 stars of England.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60-minute show about if the FBI's investigation of Kavano could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the categories against Judge Bret Kavanno delayed the final vote on his appeal to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the terms of service could affect some Republican seniors to withdraw their support.
At his meeting on Sunday, Scott Pelley, responsible for the 60-minute show, asked the Republican seniors John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could miss anything that would have made them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his partner in South Carolina.
"Yes, it does," said Kennedy.
"I said that when you went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, "Did you do it?"
He was an amateur, determined, professional."
However, Graham's vote does not seem to change.
"I've decided about Bret Kavano and I'll need an explosive category to change my mind," she said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret refused to take it for granted," said Graham, quoted at Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever has committed an offence cannot confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see it changing something new."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and famous stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the eradication of world poverty.
For seven years ago, tens of thousands of people are scheduled to flock to the Great Law of Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie Bbie and Son Mente, but also to feel for the real purpose of the event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the predecessor of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those who are actively fighting against it.
In order to ensure a free ticket at the event (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), the interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as to declare volunteers, send an email to a world leader, call or find other essential ways to contribute to the awareness of their objective of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while they are still 12 years old to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of compensation with a free association the right way to convince our colleagues to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" when some feel they're really making the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives above 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or concentrated.
The group estimates that the secured capital has so far affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the basic commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and executives, who have taken the commitment "to help children fully appreciate their capabilities", which are committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million for the elimination of subsidisation, receiving over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Cities community like you, we can make social injustice a sign of support in history," said Tracy Olman, president of The Power of Nutrition, to the community during the London Living Council in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the 5,000 actions and more than the United Kingdom called for improving food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is directed at 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" included in the common questions on the website,
A member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and hard, sometimes we will lose and fail.
But like all major human rights movements and anti-warthead movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger than ever.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Son Mende, Cardy Bbie and Jeanele Mona are some of the artists who will be present at the New York party organization, which will be presented by Deboro-Li Farnas and Hius Jakman.
The United States can use the Marine War on "exclusion" by preventing Russian exports of energy - Ministry of the Interior
Washington can return "if necessary" to its Southern War in order to prevent Russian energy from being available on the markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke discovered, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's blockade in Syria, where it operates after an invitation from the legal government, is a challenge for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons for those in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said, according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the Atlantic War, to ensure that maritime roads will remain open and, if necessary, to close them, to ensure that Russian energy will not be available on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the representatives in the context of an exhibition sponsored by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is known as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia's and Iran's treatment, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is a little rather, the valuation and replacement of fuels," said Russia with the term "one who knows only one ball", since it has an economy that depends on the oil fuels.
Statements have been made as the government of the Trabba has taken the mission to strengthen the exports of American frozen natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the most cheap choice for European consumers.
For this reason, Trab's administration, including President Donald Trabb's own, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "independence" project for North Stream 2 which, according to Trab, will become the "inflicted" Berlin of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which will double the existing ownership of the pipelines by 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Cremlin argues that Washington’s ongoing opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak said after a meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position led to Germany's reaction, which underlined its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top organisation for industry, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of making an invitation to the Presidency in 2020, says the mayor of Massachusetts.
The mayor of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that he would seriously consider the possibility of making an invitation to the Presidency after the mid-election.
At a meeting at the Hollywood Museum of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he is considering the possibility.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our problem government, and that's why a woman at the top is needed," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider a possible invitation to the Presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trabb during the meeting, saying "He leads the country into wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trab is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't learn her words about Trab and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course it's necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote".
A report published on Friday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that they should vote for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of Moscow's "probably" voters said that the mayor should not be invited, according to a survey published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
The 32% were in favour of such an invitation.
The report showed more support for possible invitation from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible invitation and 48% against.
Other public names from the Democrats who were discussed in connection with a possible invitation for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senior Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Banden said he would have made an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Peilin reported on the Trak Pellin's Trak Trab Concentration Disorder
Trak Pellin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his military service in September.
He was interviewed and charged with domestic violence on Tuesday night
"With what my son has been through since he came back, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Inter-Trafficking War and the injuries our soldiers have suffered when they return to their homeland," he said to the community at the conference for Donald Tramb in Toulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, return stronger, come back questioned whether there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country."
The second meeting was held in Vasila, Alaska, and he was charged with domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in a reference to domestic violence and armed robbery while he was in a position, according to Dan Benet, a representative of the police department of Wasila.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the question of the new asylum policy
Fifteen states and the region of Colombia support a legal dispute over the new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to escape from conflict or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the region submitted a report on friendship curiae on Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge politics, the NBC News said.
The full name of the August leader Grace v Sesion, who was founded by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been discovered.
He stated that her "and her violent sons who are members of the union" had abused her, but US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
He was kept in Texas.
The lawmakers of the cities that support Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are coming, as countries facing intense problems with harmony and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy rejected the 2014 decision taken by the Moving Committee (BIA) and allowed illegal immigrants who fled from situations of domestic violence to submit an application for asylum.
The Secretary-General of the region of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said Friday that the new policy "disregards all decades of political, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications should be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a fraud violates this principle," in the reference to friendus curiae.
Judges also stressed in the report that the policy refusing entry into the EU is detrimental to the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "make the necessary labour force".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Seison ordered the courts of immigration to refrain from giving asylum to victims who are trying to escape situations of domestic violence and harmony.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of discrimination or intimidation because of gender, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," Secion said in his communication on policy on 11 June.
The purpose of the serpent was never to solve all the problems (including the most serious) that humans face every day throughout the world.
Unidentified rescue efforts in Paul, since the number of dead is doubled despite the struggle for the spread of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly deteriorating.
"It's very intense," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, trying to rest up her baby who had a gun, at a starting point that had been stationed in the devastated city of Paul.
"Every minute the patients carry other bodies.
The clean water sucks."
Some of the residents had to return to their destroyed homes and collect their existing water, trying to increase what they could find.
Hundreds of people were also injured by hospitals, which caused damage to the 7.5 degree of the Rixter climate, were unable to cover the needs.
Some of the injuries, such as David Harris, who was in the middle and in the middle, remained outside Paul's Military Hospital, where the first aid was given in the case of continued violent transfers.
His eyes were tears as he explained how he felt about the violent scene to lure the room into the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I got stuck in the walls of the wall," Harris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope you're safe."
The U.S. ambassador charges China for "extreme" with "propagandistic statements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-day press release in a US newspaper overemphasising the mutual commercial benefits between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American Type to undermine its purpose.
U.S. President Donald Trab reported last Tuesday on China's payroll, which appeared in the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after he accused China of trying to interfere with Congress' elections on 6 November, a category that China rejects.
The Trab's category that Pekino had taken over the American elections marked what U.S. officials mentioned to Reuters was a new phase of the air-climate campaign that Washington has completed in order to exert pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are not forbidden to publish declarations on the promotion of their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a climate-intensive trade war and have imposed a variety of duties on imports.
China's tariffs in the beginnings of the trade war aimed at targeting exporters in such countries as Ioova, which supported the Republican Party of Trab, mentioned Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brandt, a US prime minister in China and a former long-term government in Iowa, a country that is an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brantard wrote in an opinion article in the Principality of Des Moines Register, "has shown this kind of fear by publishing propaganda advertisements to our free type".
"In an attempt to break this prognosis, the government of China enjoys the precious gift of freedom of speech and of the American Free Type, publishing on a pay-aside publication in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brandt.
"On the contrary, in the vicinity of Beijing, you will find at least exclusive voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the Chinese economic path, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although it did not reveal any.
The Republicans deplore female voters in view of the inter-elections due to the Fiscal with Kavano, warn analysts
As many proud Republicans continue to challenge the petition for Supreme Court Brit Kavano despite the allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, to the next intermediate elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly intense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," said Grant Reyer, professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, about an article published on Saturday.
Reyer doubts that the recent movement of Agent Jeff Flick (R-Arisona) to request an investigation from the FBI will be sufficient to attract angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow, and certainly won't forget it in November," Carin Jean-Pierer, chief councillor and national representative of the MoveOn Progress Group, said in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the speakers regularly announced the "November is coming" sign on the road to Russia as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave green light on the candidateship of Kavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, mentioned Mic.
"The interest and motivation of the Democrats will reach a level of record," said Stu Rodenberg, a political analyst, on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of women who are opposed to priests and younger voters who are 18 to 29 years of age who often do not vote when they meet the President."
Even before Ford’s public report in which he described in detail her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court petition, the analysts had predicted that there could be an reaction if the Republicans continued with the money.
"It's a terrible loss for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavano is going to be put out. It has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was brought," said Guy Cecil, director of the US priority group that helps in the election of the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat disappointed about who to believe after Fort and Kavano's accounts, which are hundreds of slightly more in favour of the second.
A new review by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents certainly or likely believed Ford's case, while 35% said that he certainly or possibly believed Kavano.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied to his position, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Felix's move, the FBI decided to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one other complainant, Dempora Ramirez, said The Guardian.
In the past week, Ford placed a heavy burden on the Justice Commission of Georgia that Kavano was attacked while he was beaten when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her parents while they were at a party when both of them were studying in Gil in the 1980 ’ s.
The world's promoter is planning to launch a new network to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the founder of the World Cup, starts a startup with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new pain of this technology cycle is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee's Open Platform Solids.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can access and what information.
In an exclusive meeting with the Fast Company, Berners Lee wondered that the intention behind Inrupt is "world government".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal electronic storage site" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, job lists, journals, music books and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a broadcast program and all at the same time.
The only feature of the personal electronic storage site is that it allows the user to decide who has access to the type of information.
The company calls this possibility "personalisation through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's executive board, John Bruce, is that the company offers resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to all.
The company is by Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some experienced programmers working on the project and a community of willing programmers.
From this week on, technology programmers around the world can create their focused applications using the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that himself and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, preventing business models at night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a publication on the Medium that circled the Sabbath, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technical Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
Over the last few months, Berner Lee has had a strong voice in the discussion on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm an excellent excuse for the next time on the Internet," added Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: Price tax on property received by the Victoria Star in World War A
The only heir to the Church of England who has received the Victory of Victoria during World War A as a soldier was valued at the patriarchate 100 years later.
Brigadier General Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a free mind four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military distinction.
The Sabbath became the discoveries of a monumental plaque from its two grandsons, which was accompanied by a passage to Rasden of Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely concocted" that the plaque discovered 100 years after his father's heroic act for which he took the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, rival Van led his gang to the Canal of Sin-Kenten through a very intense argument and while he was receiving a powerful fire from a weapon of war and bullets."
Later, he jumped into his trap and with an "extraordinary man" led the line forward, before he hit himself with a three-armed weapon.
The opposition leader Van was killed by a German freeman on 4 October 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his father's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel a little respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a post-mortem headquarters, led by the philharmonic new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great deal of interest in the event" and added that "the men of a well-known hero are evidenced by the support he has from many people."
MMA's crew were sleeping to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa in Urunaki.
Think about this scenario: You've been sleeping to watch the interesting Bellator 206, but you're excited to see this unique sports event.
The program in San José included 13 games, including six in the main card, and would be expected to live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5 in the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussay and Rory McDonald were preparing to leave the ring, the ancestors in the United Kingdom remained male when the show changed in Peppa in Urunaki.
Some did not appreciate it, since they had remained awake until the early mornings especially for the fight.
A teacher on Twitter described the presentation of the child program as "some kind of sick cheese".
"In accordance with the law, this content was not appropriate for 6 in the morning, so the child programme should be planned," said Dave Svarts, former president of the marketing and communication of Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa is Urunaki, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said that the programme would be developed to include the ancestors of the United Kingdom in the future.
"If we think about the ripples, I think we can make them," said Koker.
"But it's six Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until our Sunday hour, i.e. their Tuesdays.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change happened, many messages were exchanged before and after and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you the next time something like this will not happen.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to offer more to the lights and we're doing it.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympics at the funerals, Tom Daily, said he grew up feeling lower than the others because of his sexuality, however, that tried to make him successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until the spring that "they're not all like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give to others "hope".
He also said that since his birth, he has been interested in at least one victory in the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presence of the famous radio broadcast, was for several months on leave due to illness.
As invited to Lavern's first exhibition, Daily said he felt "not enough" compared to others when he grew up, because "it was socially unacceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said: "Even today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the strength and desire to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally knew about his sexuality.
The two times the Alpine Olympic is a period of protection of the rights of the Lao Community and its participation in the fetish-Political Agonists in Australia has been exercised to call for more countries to proceed with the certification of homophobia.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any influence, and that he wanted to give to others "hope."
Three times a global activist said it was "a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Black, who met in 2013.
Danny married Oscar Dustin Lans Black, who is 20 years older, but he argued that the age difference never existed.
"When you pass so much at such a young age" (he first shared in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find someone who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Rey Black-Delli, and Daily said he changed his "all his prospects."
"If you were asking me yesterday, I'd just like to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic metals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from cancer in the brain.
Daily said his father didn't accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether he had issued tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "Daddy, you won't be near us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was more dead finally admitted he wasn't innocent," he said.
The following year, Danny won the 2012 Olympics and won the gold medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to compete at the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, Proud by Heather Small, which inspired him in his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes controversy.
The Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The outside shape of Michaelson will sit in the park on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mileson will mark a record on Sunday, when he will play his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he should improve his performance so that he will not be remembered for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in each two-year competitions, was forced by leader Jim Forrick to sit on the four-ball and four-six-six-six-six-six-six-six.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it is customary for the United States, the winner five times shared the day with the lines and "work" his game, hoping to correct his problem points.
Without ever having the most responsible driver even at the end of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the hard territory of Le Golf National, where remote ones are often difficult.
And as if it had not been the problem of the earth, Michaelson, in one of the sun's games, faces Francesco Molinari, a British Open champion, who cooperates with the first-time Tommy Flagwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the start of 12 singles, can take the lead with a good principle, Michaelson's game can be critical.
Forrick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He took the role he plays today, hit me friendlyly on the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's got great self-confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and has offered too much to these groups, both last week and this week.
I don't think I've calculated him playing two games.
I thought more, but we ended up there and so we thought we should celebrate.
He wants to get out there like everybody else."
Michaelson will pass Nick Falto's record for most major games in Ryder Cup.
He could have noticed the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 winnings, 20 winnings and seven months, although Forrick said his presence had a benefit for the team.
"He's funny, charismatic, spiritual, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent at the team's house," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun with him this week. It was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that the big turn can soon be lost.
Thomas Biorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great adventure that starts from the singles of the last day in Ryder Cup can easily turn into ice.
Danos made his debut in the 1997 Valderram battle, where a team with leader Seve Ballasteros managed to take advantage of five degrees against the Americans, but only when he was able to complete the final line with a difference of foot, winning 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remember yourself constantly that we had a great adventure in Valderram, we had a great adventure in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only after violence," said Bourne, in the picture, following the birth of 2018, to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and to be directed 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the members of the group that this has not been over.
We're going to get ready tomorrow to give it all.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's done until you see the levels on the table.
We have a goal, to win this way, and we're moving there.
I always say I admire the 12 players in our group, but we know very well that there are the same good players in the other group – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult area of golf, Biorn adds: "I wouldn't be quick to forward the result.
Tomorrow's another cat.
Tomorrow's measuring the individual practice and that's something different.
It's great to be in the field with a participant when things go well, but when you're out there alone, then you're testing your skills as a golf player.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, how to get the best out tomorrow.
You leave your companion behind and he must give it all and show him the best of himself."
In contrast to Biorn, Jim Forrick from the rival team would ask his players to note better personal performances than those who had been with their stakeholders, except Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Forrick himself has survived the two sides of the last day's change, since he belonged to the winning team in Brooklyn before the unexpected moment, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember his word every time," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenso, the leader in 1999, had encouraged his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brooklyn, like Medinah.
When we get this money, there's a lot of pressure in the middle of the games.
We decide our series according to our analysis and play with the series he is watching for us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the fight and faces Rory Makilroy in the top game, with the Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Floyd and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the top of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it's covering the whole road," Bbyrn said, justifying his options for the singles.
New withdrawal for Germany's new warship
The new flagship of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the ageed military vessels of the peace period, but it is not to be adopted until the next year, due to inadequate systems and the cost incurred, indicate local means.
The position in service of the Rhineland-Pfalz fleet, the shipowner of the entire Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has been suspended until the first quarter of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which is called a representative of the armed forces.
The ship would have had to be built in the Atlantic War in 2014, but the delivery problems were determined for the success of the pilot project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg vessels that announced the 2007 Navy War will replace the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
They will bring strong rules, a series of anti-aircraft and over-ship fires, as well as some steel technologies, such as reduced radar, superheated and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance works is reduced, as it will be possible to use new brakes for up to two years outside the German doors.
However, continued delays mean that although military ships are considered to be the latest technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad, until the end of service is completed, Die Zeit points out.
The F125 F125 disaster became a prime event last year when the German Naval War deliberately refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There has been no great deal of information about the reasons for the return, but the German media have mentioned a number of significant "software and materials" that would make the warship useless if it was used to send war.
The software problems were particularly important. Since Baden-Wuerttemberg ships have about 120 ships full, only half compared to the older Bremen fleets.
It was also discovered that the ship has a much higher weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have double weight from similar vessels used by the Germans during World War B.
In addition to the minor equipment, the cost of the entire project (including payment training) was also a matter.
It is said that it reached the euro 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the new fleets are particularly important since Germany's shippower is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Atlantic War "will soon have no ships for missions".
The officer said that the problem was solved over time because the old ships were overloaded, but there were other ships to replace them.
It was argued that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg icebreakers could be included in the Marine War.
National Trust hides the dark life of the night
A new research carried out at a farm in the Netherlands of Scotland aims to discover how the nighters use the place when they follow their food.
The enlargements will shed new light on these unique wastes and will contribute to the planning of future environmental protection actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the customs of the common Christmas and micronight, as well as the coffee of the Ouija board and the Dobenton Museum in Inverwe Gardens, Western Ross.
Special records will be placed at four locations around the building to monitor night activities throughout the season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand-explosives.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by specialists will examine the frequency of calls at night, as well as what kinds of behaviour this has.
As a result, a map of the habitat and a report will be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour in climate change.
Rob Dwar, Natural Environmental Protection Council for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important for the night and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of habitats and the best way to maintain forests for nighttime and other related species.
The night population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced since the past century.
They are driven by construction works and development projects that affect the parts where they pollinate and destroy their habitats.
The immune systems and lighting are also a risk as well as colletal films for mice and some chemical processes of construction materials, as well as attacks by oxidized cats.
Nights aren't really dark.
However, because they follow the night, these are more useful than their eyes to catch their breath.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect entomities and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important sites and 76,000 foreign lands throughout the country, considers it very important at night.
It has ten trained experts who carry out regular research, inspect the parts where evening worship is conducted and sometimes spend it.
The organisation has also created Scotland's first and only escape for nights in the village of Thrave, in Dumfris and Galway, where they live eight of the ten species of Scotland.
The building manager, David Thompson, says the building is the ideal place for the nights.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for the night," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many big trees and an ideal habitat.
There are still many things we don't know about tonight, so the work we do here, but others will help us to understand better what they need in order to increase their population."
It stresses that it is important to be first checked for the existence of nights prior to any maintenance work in homes, since the destruction of one and only small fire could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nights are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, to break them or to disturb their security, or to destroy their prey.
Elizabeth Ferel, a member of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said, "We can learn a lot about our nights and many of our species just don't know the development of their population."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of violence, as his lawyers are preparing to send a German periodical
Christian Ronaldo described the accusations of violence against him as "fake news", saying that some "will self-defense" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to send the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Juventh is accused of violating an American named Kathryn Magyarka in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she was brought to pay $375.000 to buy her cigarette and not to mention anything about the situation, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram to 142 million teachers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five times winner of the Ballas Cross in the camera.
"They want to self-defence and use my name.
It's natural.
They want to be listed using my name, but this is part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to send Der Spiegel a message on the charges he published, which were described as "an unacceptable reference to claims affecting private life", according to Reuters.
Judge Christian Skertz said that the player will demand compensation for "ethical damage due to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The alleged situation is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a village of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night party centre, Ronaldo and Magorga returned to the player's room, where they brought her in for physical violence according to documents from the Clark District Court of Nevada.
Majorca claims that Ronaldo fell to the knees after the alleged situation and told her that it was at "99 percent" a "good guy", but offered him another "one hundred".
The documents state that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual contact, but that he was sensitive.
Magyarka also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial solution, because she "was afraid of possible resistance" and was concerned about her "public solution".
The 34-year-old says he is trying to reverse the regulation, as he continues to suffer from a traumatic syndrome due to the underlying situation.
Ronaldo was willing to receive a translation to Real Madrid from Manchester Juniard at the time of the alleged abuse, and this Friday he transferred to the Italian Yuvents by way of an agreement of up to EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will forever change the car industry's loss"
The United Kingdom "will move forever" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "inconceivable" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its workshop in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry said that the impact of cross-border delays on Brexit's case without an agreement could cost jobs.
The workshop in Bernaston, where Auris and Avensis models are being built in Toyota, offered nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were spent in the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped at our workshop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Board of Directors in Bern.
Other automobile industries in the United Kingdom have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has declared that it will close Mini's workshop in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks to the supply chain according to the car industry in case Brexit does not agree.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. The replacements arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars built after order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and lack of supplies according to the sector.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep a warehouse after one day at her workshop in Derbysair, the company mentioned, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Tereza May's plan on the future relationship with the EU "works specifically to address cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The information coming from not only Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure the continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long it would stop production, however, warned that the additional cost would slow down the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Chuvalari, who has been working here in Bernaston for 24 years and is the associate director of the Unit at the workshop, said that members of the body are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never recover.
A representative of the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House reports.
Donald Trab's important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can "increase another week", as the debate continues for the Supreme Court's bid, Brett Kavano, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the work of Special Rapporteur Robert Miuler, who is investigating the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trab's aid to Russia and the possible interference of justice by the President.
It is possible that Trab will eliminate the supplemental General Prosecutor, risking Miller's independence, feeds Washington's bullets here and for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosentin discussed the possibility of having a girl to record her talks with Trab and to make it possible for the president to be removed on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosentin refused the report.
However, last Tuesday he moved to the White House through reports that it was intended to be abandoned.
On the contrary, a meeting with Trab was announced on Friday, which was then held at the United Nations in New York.
Trab said it would "pretend" not to dissolve Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to comply with the hearing procedure before the Justice Committee of Georgia in which both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday, Trab ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation within one week on charges against Kavano, thus further delaying the implementation of the vote by the Republic of Georgia.
Sarah Sanders, a representative of Trab's type, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There has not yet been a date, perhaps this week, but maybe another week of data from all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, otherwise I'd like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists have responded to this claim: Sanders has been providing type information in the White House since 10 September.
The representative Chris Walla asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of information was not due to prejudice to the "printing" movements of television newspapers, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are shown".
He then let it be understood that there will be increased or direct communication between Trab and the type.
"The President gives more meetings than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding: "We looked at these numbers."
Information will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the guy has the opportunity to address questions directly to the President of the United States, this is definitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to apply it often and you have seen that we often apply it in the last few weeks and will take the place of type information where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trab is often accepted when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or meetings of type with official visitors.
Individual type meetings are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out why this is happening with a controversial and often different phenomenon in front of concentrated journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in the National Health System of Scotland through fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in the Scotland National Health System to express their gratitude and to welcome them to remain and after the United Kingdom has been removed from the European Union.
Jean Freman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter while there are less than six months left to expel the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to cover the cost of applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mr. Freman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on discharge continued and led to expected decisions on the death penalty.
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also been preparing for a possible non-aggression scenario.
I know that this period must be especially difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every official on nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is always your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrobi is subjected to urgent surgery after injury to the head
The defendant of the Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrobi team was subjected to an urgent surgery after a trauma at the head of the battle on Saturday, where the Tennessese State Tigers were led with a score of 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as succeeded by the newspaper Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Ride's main promoter told reporters that the injury occurred a little earlier than a half-year ago.
"He came to the park and just dropped there," said Reid.
The miners and the medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen to the pack and then put it in a office and then carried it back for further evaluation.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nasville, Tennessee that Abercrobi came out of the workshop at the Water Center Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there is no "data on the type/extension of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury happened.
Abercrobi, a second-year student under limited participation regime ("redshirt"), distributes his first season in Tennessee State after his translation from Illinois.
He took five total lessons on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching 18 total lessons for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher rate of credit for the United Kingdom’s real estate market
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher rate of credit for the United Kingdom’s real estate market, while the additional amounts will be used for the provision of aid to customers, in accordance with the new plans of Toris
The measure will enhance the success of the Corbin Army in attracting young voters
The increase in the end-of- paper will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to concentrate up to 120 million English lires per year on aid to farmers
Foreign buyers will begin to pay higher credit for the United Kingdom’s real estate market, while the additional financial amounts will be used for the provision of aid to customers, as Teresa May will now announce.
The measure will be considered as an example of the success of the Jeremy Corbin Army's campaign to attract young voters with more economic support commitments and to aim for higher rates.
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will strengthen the government's army to combat the lack of foothold.
The increase, which is due at the current end of the paper, along with the highest tax rates that have been introduced two years ago for the second-party housing market and for housing to be decommissioned, may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Economics expects the measure to bring up up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of young people in London are bought by people who are not residents of the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult for first-time purchasers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "police-magic" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the end of the paper so that more new people could get their first residence.
He told the large construction companies that he had kept the prices of the high buildings, however, taking land without using it and invited Mr. May to cancel the ceilings in economic premises in order to restore Britain's 'grain strength'.
Mr. Corbin recommended a series of impressive proposals for positive changes, including controls on private property and the prohibition of exports "non-compliant".
He also wants to give greater powers to the councils in order to build new houses.
Mr. May said: "I have said that I will devote my ministry to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
This is due to the adjustment of the dissolved asset market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies who sit abroad to buy homes as easily as the hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of housing property has become too far away and the lack of support remains sufficient."
Jack Ross: "My perfect hospitality is to prepare the Scottish team."
Sanderland's leader, Jack Ross, says his "final charity" is to become a promoter of Scotland's national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is encouraged by the challenge to stop the group of North-East England, which is currently in the third position in the "League One" category, three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Fire Stadium on Wednesday, after he had previously brought St. Mary back to Scotland's previous competition season.
"I wanted to compete for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that was "Ros at the BBC of Scotland on the Sports Sound radio.
"But I grew up looking at the Scottish team in Habbden along with my father as a child, and that's what always got me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have success in promoting groups."
Among the Russians in Sanderland are Dick Andvokat, David Mogias, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gas Pojit and Paolo D. Canio.
Aloa Athletic's former promoter says that he did not feel embarrassed when he was invited to address such well-known names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Yupswitt Taun.
"At this point the success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "I can bring this group back to Premier Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, there is doubt in Prime Minister Lig said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably think of myself as successful here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross began his career as a procurator just three years ago, having spent a long time as an assistant procurator in Dambarton and a 15-month period in the preparatory staff of Harts.
He then helped Aloa come back from the introduction to the third category and led St. Meren from the bottom of the signing of the Treaty in the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartpole, Folkerk, St. Meren and Hamilton Acanthemical.
"It was perhaps a real road," said an interesting speaker of Aloa's position.
"I really thought it was more appropriate for me to be a promoter than a player.
It sounds weird 'cause I went well, I made some money out of it and I've got pretty high enough.
But playing it can be hard.
You have to suffer a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still in trouble with the anxiety and pressure of the job, but my employer's job is absolutely equal.
I always wanted to prepare and now that I do it, I feel more comfortable than I have felt with myself in my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30mm on Saturday, according to research.
The final fuel boosted the profits for Britain's tested dad but brought greater pressure on the restaurants.
The popes and the bar noted an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profit of the restaurants was reduced by 4.8 per cent, as revealed by the figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy company, who concentrated the data, said: "The continued euphoria and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup was the result of July to follow a similar pattern with the previous month, June, where the pope's profits increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even worse.
The reduction of 1.8 percent in the revenue of the restaurants in June just destroyed July.
Dads and bars serving alcohol went far better, with the corresponding facts of the previous years more than they had lost the corresponding data of the restaurants.
Dads serving food also spent the summer days, although not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to get out for coffee.
In all managed popes and bars, the oil sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Neuman, from the RSM company's respiratory and philology analysts, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of important social or sporting events remains the main factors in terms of sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that clusters of restaurants continue to be difficult, but the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly confusing data on the continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared in a worse time for business in the station area and the time will show whether the lowest temperatures we have survived in August will give us a much longer extension."
The total increase in sales to popes and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the distortion of commercial name advertising.
The Coffer Peach Tracker market indicator for the United Kingdom’s pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, with a total working cycle of over 9 million England lires and is the specified reference point of the industry.
One in five children keep secret accounts in a social network, hidden from their parents.
As research reveals, one in five children - even 11 years of age - keep secret accounts in social networking, hidden from their parents and teachers
A study of 20,000 Gymnasium students revealed an increase in the fake Insta pages in Instagram
This announcement aroused fear that sexual content is being reported.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "master" account to show their parents.
One of the five children - even 11 years of age - create accounts on social media, which are kept secret by adults.
A survey of 20,000 Gymnasium students revealed a real increase in fake Insta accounts - it is a reference to the Instagram photo reporting site.
This announcement aroused fear that sexual content is being reported.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept a healthy "main" account to show their parents while keeping their own accounts at the same time.
A mother who successfully found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a legacy that she wanted to live with ("live with").
The study conducted by the Digital Awarenness UK and the HMC in an independent school found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they kept secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Bboucanan said: "It is disturbing that so many refugees are tempted to create Internet sites where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "players' voice" at the Scottish team council.
Eilid Doyle was appointed as an executive adviser to the Scotland-level council at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most popular sports team and President Jan Betty has taught her choice as a great opportunity for those who lead the violence to benefit from her extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eelind enjoys great respect for the whole of the Scottish, British and global community of steel and we are sure that the steel in Scotland will benefit greatly from its entry into the Council," Betty said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited that I'm going to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help with the leadership of the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, having won a total of four Olympic medals and is now a regular student in BBC, remained on balance after a temporary chemical angelic brain attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I got a brain.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only the time will show me how much I'm going to cry.
It was awesome, but I was completely sick, I learned to walk again and I'm doing charity exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Dissemination of female who compares female females with females violates the online common opinion
A textile production company has lost its online common opinion with a publication comparing mothers who are breastfeeding with farmers who approve them.
In order to launch it under the so-called "first world sports and entertainment", Elvie’s consumer technology company cycled a chimory advertising inspired by video clips to demonstrate the freedom it offers to pregnant mothers to the new theatre.
Four real mothers dance in a bunch of full-fledged flowers, with a song that includes places like: "Yes, I agree with myself, but you don't see any sky" and "If you haven't noticed it, these are not masters, they're my wives."
The bride continues: "Dear it, kiss it, kiss it, kiss it, kiss it, kiss it, like my ladies."
However, the publication, published on the company’s website on Facebook, has caused online opposition.
With 77,000 challenges and hundreds of comments, the video has produced mixed reactions by teachers, as many say it does not take seriously the "fridge" of the milk industry.
"It is a very unfortunate decision to use eggs to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies steal them a few days after birth," someone said.
Elvie's beach is divided into a pond (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said: "It seems to be harmful both for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to publish posters for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A statement completely out of fact."
Others opposed the announcement, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "distractive".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a mirror if I was still hungry.
It made me feel like an eagle.
The announcement is a bit of a joke, but I didn't want to get over it.
It's a smart product," someone wrote.
Another school said: "It's a funny announcement aimed at mothers who are breast milk (slow in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like "gears".
It is not a declaration that attracts or endorses the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they were all dancing with the different stars buried inside their tents.
The logic behind the publicity campaign is based on the idea that many women who are breast milk with breast milk say they feel like pigs.
Elvie's body, however, is completely amorous, doesn't have horns or tubes and is divided into a thin fabric, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go out during the drill.
Anna Balarin, co-chair and Executive Director at Mother, said: "The Elvie theatre is such a revolutionary product that deserved a tolmous and provocative launch.
By making a comparison between female and lactating females, we wanted to focus on breast milking and all the challenges it faces, at the same time showing at the same time the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new wave.
It's not the first time Elvie's star becomes a primer.
During the week of London's fashion, a mother of two children appeared at the church for the design of Marta Yakobovski while using the product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants were moved to orphanage in construction at the border of Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants has reached the highest levels, although the monthly thresholds remained relatively stable, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the regime have made it more difficult for children to be compared with conservatives.
Traditionally, most conservationists are also immigrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to go ahead and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was felt in June when the federal authorities announced that the authorities and other senior members of their household would have to issue fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior staff member of the Immigration and Télonion Service, pointed out to Congress that the service has arrested dozens of people who were asked to keep homeless.
Later the service confirmed that 70 percent of the inmates had a white fine.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either conservants or members of the conservatory are found in the country of illegality and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to accuse these people," Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the implementation of children’s cases, the authorities have introduced new rules in which some of these children should appear before court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as has previously been done, in accordance with refugee workers.
Many will appear at an icono-television meeting in the position of self-representation in order to develop their claims for the provision of a legal provision before the jurisdiction of a judge on immigration matters.
Those who believe that they do not meet the conditions for release will be immediately dismissed.
The more children remain under detention, the more likely they are to be arrested or tortured, which may lead to violent beatings or consequences, according to refugee workers and reports from the system in recent months.
The experts said that these concerns are due to greater facilities such as Turin, where the evidence that a child is suffering is more likely not to be perceived because of the size of the facilities.
They added that children’s movement to the stage without sufficient time to prepare their children psychologically or get rid of their friends can harm the wound they already experience.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "ownership forces" to be withdrawn immediately.
Head of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walden Al Mualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, although the war in the country is more than a hundred years away.
Mualem, who serves as an additional prime minister, said that foreign forces are found illegal in a Syrian territory, under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and "will receive proper treatment."
"They must be rejected immediately and free of conditions," he said to the convention.
Mualem continued that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "give this priestly fight until we crush all the Syrian terrorists" and by both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of the country's war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions were good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "warning parallel fears" that forced refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politifying a question that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria if there was no political agreement between Asand and the conflict to end the war.
The United States diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a detached zone in the last major minister of revolutions in Indlib created an opportunity for political discussions to be promoted.
The Russian agreement has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-supported serial forces at the beginning, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military operations would target Jihadists, including those associated with Al-Qaida Metapo Nusra, who "will be excommunicated".
The Special Representative of the United Nations, Stefan de Moshura, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to the preparation of a anti-war Constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for the elections.
Mualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the present Constitution" and warned that no intervention should be made.
Why Trab will win a second term?
With this logic, Mr Trab will again win the 2020 elections unless, as many friendly viewers are likely to hope, the motion for a resolution and the scandals premise its presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic final of all times!"
So far, there are no evidence of tattooing.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-television area have been exceeded by reaching 1.05 million CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million televisions in the high-television area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's release "The Rachel Maddow Show" has dialed television numbers on television, with 3.5 million televisions on important news nights.
It's a light to which people are attracted because it's something we don't understand," said Nil Baer, a producer of the ABC drama series "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, a veteran novelist and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
It remembers a trip by train to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her manager said he was going to vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked "Why?"
"He answered "Because he makes me laugh," said Mr. Scowell.
No one can even have fun with the noise.
Of course, contrary to what happens to television series, scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roe v. Weind case if immigrant families can restore the health of the world economy.
The change in frequency is a diversity that only the most preferable televisions can enjoy.
However, you pass the definition of the informed city when you find yourself in six hours watching a group of specials to discuss the use of "polluary meetings in the scene" by Bomb Guttworth for the book "Fear" ("Foobo"), Paul Manaford's bomber jacket from a 15000-dollar-full-winter skin ("a full-winter" according to Washington Post) and the results of the linguistic descriptions by Stormy Daniels on his report.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again the same way.
"What does and what makes you feel the reality of the show is that it gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and television program creator "Pown Stars" about the constantly changing behaviors and daily changes in Trab's performance panel (beginning with N.F.L., quoted by Kim Young Owen).
You don't have the ability to lose any impact, otherwise you stay behind.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius out of his house in the north coast of Hawaii, but he was locked in looking at MSNBC while he was designing CNN.
It could not continue, not when Bret Kavano was intended to appear before the Justice Committee of Georgia and the future of the Supreme Court was held by a locker.
"I remember we did those terrible explosions before, and the world said, "This will mean the beginning of Western culture," said Mr. Flys.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it proves they were finally right."

External money is included in the most limited measurement for the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress is receiving money flow, thanks to the restructuring of the electoral regions of Congress, which has put two members of the Congress candidate for the same position.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh Preamble is represented by the Democratic Representative Conor Lab, who was elected to another region in special elections held before the opening.
Lab has another energy representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the former 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely composed of the new 17th electoral region.
The cards were recast after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held in January that the former regions were treated in contravention of the interests of the Republicans.
The electoral re-measurement in the new 17th electoral region has fueled a financial competition between the major financial divisions of the parties, the Democratic Committee for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican Extradition (NCRC).
Lamb became a public in Pennsylvania after he won a limited victory at a special election survey held in March for the 18th electoral region of Pennsylvania in Congress, followed by a lot of people.
This position was kept by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Tramb won the region for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give the Democrats a simple preview.
The United States examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but did so back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing bitter reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Barella in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the meeting left the administrative group of the Trabs.
The officials of St. Dipartement decided to call on the American Head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", as Heder Nawert, representative of the type of service earlier this month, said.
However, the imposition of sanctions was examined only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received approximately 140 million US dollars as American aid in 2017, among others for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on passports, would be applicable to the country of Central America, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings were being developed, officials of the North and Central America held a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic well-being, followed by a corresponding concentration taken by the country last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the transfer of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted to proceed to the meeting, giving a substantial end to the idea of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens will be addressed to the meeting, which has already been scheduled for mid-October, indicating the importance of the concentration of administration, as the diplomats have said.
And the three American refugees returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House by Mr Bolton refused to speak on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations under the name.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst located near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
Read History
The next attack may be the report of Special Council Robert Miller on the abuse of justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has already been published.
It is reported that Mr. Miuler is also changing his investigation into possible overlap between Mr. Trab's pre-election military and Russia with regard to the Russian attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trab will be in favour of this body, as it is prepared to reconvene the Presidency at the next elections and perhaps finally before the Court of Justice.
The 'yes' are many and I do not believe that Mr Trab's fall, nor his slogans in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide the course of this war.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to take action against Hitler if the West had opposed him and had supported the Czechoslovaks in Monaco.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of killing that followed.
The course of history is surrounded by such points of camp and the uncertainty of democracy is accelerated or distorted.
The Americans now come against quite a few of these camp points.
What should we do if Mr. Trab has dismissed the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds Mr. Miuler's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote in that paper that last night he proposed to be secretly photographed by the president and that he considered him unworthy of the position of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the statement adopted by the Times was an insult.
"How will we answer if the appellant's investigation of the F.B.I. for Bret Kavano is not complete or fair or if it is appointed to the Supreme Court in spite of the basic categories of sexual assault and false charges?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-elections for a Congress that will put Mr Trab's successor?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long-distance.
But because of what I've learned, I don't think we're gonna fail.

Graham Dorans of Reingers is an advocate for the fight against Rapid Vienna.
Reingers accepts Rapind Vienna on Friday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive isomale in Spain with the Vigarian earlier this month, will give her a lot of possibilities for winning from the 7th Group of Europe League.
A gonorrhea injury prevented middle Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until his 2-2 score score with Vigarian, but he believes that Reingers can use this result as an opportunity for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vijareal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went to the game, thinking we could do something and we went out with a degree.
We may have been able to escape to the end, but, in general terms, inequality was another legal result.
It was probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Now, Friday is another big European night.
Well, good stuff, we can take three degrees, but it will be a hard game because they have a good effect on their last game, but, with the world on the outside, I'm sure we can put our powers and make a positive result.
The past year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and changes made to the same group, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the proposal is good.
Let's hope that we can put our strength behind us now, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of sexual harassment
Although the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be interviewed, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they were discussing with their spouses about the cost of long-term unemployment.
Only 10 percent said they've talked about this to their children.
"People want to take care of their family, but they don't take the initiative to conduct the discussion," said Holly Snaider, the representative of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
Start with this.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes too early.
Work with your council and your family to discuss where and how to get a discount, since these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Take your financial advice: Your advice can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your long-term retirement options may include a traditional long-term retirement insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a market price to help you cover these costs or security with your own property - enough to have money.
Build up your legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts.
Take a look at health care issues so that you can identify a trusted person to see your medical care and ensure that health professionals will comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, collect what you can do to make a contribution to your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on economic matters and ensure that your accounts are paid, if you are not marketed.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aging parent is facing an extremely serious health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Please refer these details to a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.

Andre received a lot of guns with a plane gun at Ilfracomb
A man received a lot of guns with a plane gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb in Devon, when he received shots at his chest, neck and hand.
The police described the event, which took place at 02:30 British Summer, as "happy event".
The victim didn't see the victim of the attack.
The injuries he suffered are not hazardous to his life and the police are calling for witnesses.
Seismo and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications to stop, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to get information from Dongala, a region in the north of Paul, which is located closer to the centre of the 7.5 degree range of the Rihter climate.
In Paul’s day more than 16,000 people were expelled after the destruction.
There are some important facts about Paul and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Paul is the head of the capital of the center of Sulawiezi, located at the end of a close hill on the west coast of the island of Sulawiezi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was on its 40th anniversary when she was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongkala is a resistance that extends over 300 miles (180 km) of actogram to the island’s island of Sulawesi.
The contrast, a level of administrative division below the principle, was estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the capital of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important at the beginning, but it is more likely to meet in Moroulai, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Paul and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tunami also hit the western Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean in the seismic Valley of Fire and is often accompanied by sediments.
Some of the most recent sediments and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atsech in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, while over half of them were in Atsech.
2005: A series of powerful strikes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead bodies on the island of Nicaea, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The magnitude 6.8 degree of the Rixter climate hit the southern part of Yavas, the most complex island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 degree scale of the Rixter climate with focus near Pantang, the capital of the eastern Sumara.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 degree earthquake in the Rixter climate struck one of the Isle of Mindau, near Sumara, causing a tsunami of 10 meters, which destroyed tens of villages and cost about 300 people their lives.
2016: A low-level earthquake struck the area of Pindi Jaja in Atsech, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the disaster experienced by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
It wasn't called a tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the island of Lompok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily displaced.
Sarah Pellin's firstborn son was gathered for family violence
Trak Peillin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for the presidency of Sara Pellin was gathered for attack.
The 29-year-old Peillin, from the village of Alaska, was gathered as an observer for domestic violence, a ban on complaints of domestic violence and resistance against the authorities, according to a report published on the Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to accuse her of committing crimes, she started the phone with her hands.
Peilin is kept temporarily in the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a guarantee of up to $500, as mentioned at the KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "surely innocent" when he was asked, as stated by the network.
Peilin faces categories for three classes of A, which means he can be punished with a prison sentence of up to one year and a financial fine of $250,000.
It is also charged for category A fines, which are punished by a day-to-day detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time there's criminal proceedings against Pellin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Pellin.
His mother, Sarah Pellin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has already been brought before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was subjected to charges of domestic violence, a ban on the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of weapons, while he was in a state of high-level position.
His associate claimed that he had touched her face.
Sarah Peilin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 when she faced her son’s violent behavior with a climate-distorted disturbance caused by his service in Iraq.
Seismo and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after the earthquake struck the island of Sulawezi in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 degrees of the Rixter climate caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have stopped, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next days.
The scene struck near the center of Sulawezi, located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social networks, video is being circulated from the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people were assembled for a beach party in the city of Paul when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutors call for a recently imposed death penalty to monitor the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty on Saiful Saipov, the dream of the terrorist attack on New York that cost eight people life - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30 years old, has been using a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a road along the West Side train in the South Manhattan, by means of trains and bikes found on the road on October 31.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors should prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willedly" and caused serious physical damage "willedly", in accordance with the declaration of intention to impose the death penalty imposed on the New York District Court.
And these two categories add to the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal shipyard brought Sajipope in comparison with category 22 categories, which included eight categories of homicide for criminal organization, a rule often applied by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and a category for the use of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required "important planning and premise," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "a terrible, strong and terrible."
"Saifulo Habibulavits Saipop has caused road accidents, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decant, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Erna Ferutsie, Erna Diego Mentosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as mentioned in the declaration of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the South-South Court of New York filed a complaint on a case that raises the death penalty.
The defendant, Halind Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to equal treatment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 on the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were sentenced to a joint trial for the execution of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
And the two Rosenbergs were on the power race on June 19, 1953.
Saipoff, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared impatient the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the prosecutors that he felt satisfied with his action, according to the police.
Saipoff told the authorities that he was committed to ending the ISIS video attack he saw on his cell phone, according to the category.
He also asked for ISIS to stand in his hospital room, in accordance with the police.
He was innocent of the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Paton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipoff, said they were "probably disappointed" by the decision of the intelligence authority.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty against the acceptance of the declaration of equal treatment with no possibility of detention will simply extend the injury caused to all involved," Paton said.
The Saipof's opposition team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
President of the Council says Natezel Faratz should be appointed head of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage was about to "initiate the people's army" today during a protest concentration at the Toris conference.
The former head of the United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP) said that politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Teresa May's Members said he should be head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative President Peter Bowen told the speakers at Bermigham that the United Kingdom "would have gone" so far if Mr Farage was the competent Minister for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mr May in her attempt to bring her deep-rooted Members together was underlined by the fact that former EU officials in Toris participated in a separate protest concentration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Czech Conciliation Plan under control through attacks by Brexit's victims, EU and EU residents.
Contestants continued their efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between her package and "haust".
Mr. Bowen said at the Leave Means Leave (Retirement means Retirement) protest in Solihal that he wanted to fly "the Czechs project".
He said he should have been given a title of grace to Mr Farage and had been given responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were the boss, we'd have already left now," he said.
A member from Wallingbo added: "I will support Brexit, but we must fly the Czechs project."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to become subordinates.
We want to build our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowen rejected the allegations that the common opinion had been changed by the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely unexpected."
Toris Andrea Jenkins, President-in-Office of Brexit, was also present at the event and told the journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers project does not accept the general public, Antipoliticalism does not want to vote for it, it does not accept our party and our activists who go down the streets and below us are elected.
Please leave the Chekers project and start listening."
With an intelligent message to Mr. May, he added: "The ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj said at the meeting of the debate that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are ready to make the decision adopted by the 2016 resolution.
"There is already a question of confidence between us - the people - and the class of our policies," he said.
"They're trying to give Brexit and we're here today to tell them "We won't let you fuck her if you do that."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make the class of our policies, which are ready to give Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are moving this country's popular army that won us with Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and sovereign United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the EU's survivors went to Bermigham before holding a fair concentration at the city centre.
A few activists attacked the Torris against Brexit after the group's concentration this Saturday.
Member of the Labour Lord Adonis closed the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an application of the section at the beginning of the meeting.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technical means needed for the EU-type Agreement. – Canada with ambultism, for unintended borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute physics.
It doesn't mean good Brexit added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider the possibility of making an invitation to the presidency.
Americaida, Senior Minister Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the possibility of inviting the presidency after November's elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the President of the Republics from Massachusetts spoke about its future plans during a conference at the Western Massachusetts office on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trab, re-elected November, with the Republican representative of the town of Jeff Dale, who was co-chaired by the army of Trab in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is estimated that it can be remedied with Trab in 2020.
The exhibition on Saturday evening was her 36th meeting with voters using the building structures since the start of the Trab's term.
One of the speakers at the conference asked her if she was planning to make an invitation to the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time "to go to Washington women to build our dissolved government and that means a woman must be found in the top."
Arrest for the deadly gunfire of LSU Sims.
The police at the Baton Rouge of Los Angeles announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of LSU White Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouz's police department announced the capture of Denton Simpson, 20 years old, at a meeting of a guy at 11m (East Zone).
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man who appeared on the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of Southern England before lunch.
"Weind Sims suffered from a stroke on his head, which led to his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to the website 247sports.
Weind came in to convince his friend and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson replied and admitted that he was found at the point with his gun and admitted that he had shot Wade Sims.
Samson was assembled without opposition and is held in the Police Department of Eastern Baton Rouge.
The third-year student of Sims with a height of 1.98, who grew up in Baton Rouge played in 32 matches, with 10 performances as the main player in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebacks per match.
Gran Prei of Russia: Louis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Botas passed before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the fight.
In the office, Botas had a good start and almost stopped Hamilton, since he was opposed to his position on the first two turns and invited Fettel to his camp.
Fatel first went to the gates and let Hamilton run into the sky of the course, which should be definite.
Mercedes went to the pizzas a little later and left behind Fatell, but Hamilton went ahead after a train fight, which forced Ferrari's driver to leave the internal cause of the risk of going beyond the double motion to convince the third party.
Max Ferstapen began from his last position and was seven at the end of the first cycle of his 21st birthday.
He then remained the first for a large part of the fight, as he kept his lashes in order to finish quickly and pass before Kimmy Reaconen in fourth place.
He finally went to the roads around 44th, but he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Reikonen came fourth.
It's a hard day because Valteri was fantastic all weekend and he was a real boss who let me through.
The team took it very well and did it one-two," Hamilton said.
The body's language was very bad.
President Donald Trab welcomed senior Dean Fynstein at a meeting on Saturday for her stay that he did not interfere with Christine Blazi Ford's letter, in which he accused the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano's petition for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President was not directly mentioned in the report given by Ford to the Justice Commission of Georgia, arguing that the people quoted in Georgia proved that people are "unprivileged and ignorant and liars."
"The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that happens in Russia in the last few days, where you see the victim, you see people who are angry and
"When you see publications and delays and then they say to you, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Fantain, did you have a break?
Remember her answer... you ruined the document-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't interrupt."
Well, half a minute.
If we're late... no, we're not late," added the nurse.
Finstein received Ford's letter containing details of the categories against Kavano in July and she was earlier disappointed in September - but Finstein refused to be fired from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's categories, I didn't ruin her history," Fynstein said to the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep her safe and I kept her safe as he asked me."
But her refusal did not seem particularly to say to the president, who had attended during the Saturday session: "I would tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to challenge the petition for the Supreme Court, which was charged by three women for sexual harassment, the President left it to be understood that the Democratics use the categories to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power by using any necessary means.
You see evil, madness, they don't care who hurt, who have to struggle to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite news site.
Elite Lig: Danny Stars 5-3 Belfast Jaands
Patrick Dwyer put two glasses for the Jaands against Dandy.
Dandi Stares took an explanation for her age at the Battle of Parochius in Elite Lig from Belfast Jaands, winning the 5-3 row at Dandi on Saturday.
The Jaands took a easy ride with two golfers with Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovigier.
Mike Salifan and Jordan Kauni brought the ice cream for the farmers before Dwyer re-enacted the Jaands.
Françoise Busher made an award for Dandy and then two Golls from Lucas Ludwald Nilsen assured the team's win.
It was the third time in Elite Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who came with a 2-1 score score on Dandi in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth session of the season between the two groups, with the Jaands winning the three previous games.
Dwyer opened the score at 3:35 with Central MacFol's assistant, while David Raderford expressed his appreciation for which Bovier doubled the tour four minutes later.
In an accommodating full-time action, Sullivan re-entered the field team at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the audience a chance to get out of Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the advance for the Jaands in the first half of the year when he reached his second goal for the night to the end of the first period.
The group of landers was retreated, and Bushar sacrificed again with a glass of evidence at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Korkoran joined their forces to help Nilesen deliver their first victory in Dandi in the final battle at the end of the second period and he assured the winner of his fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
Jaands, who have already lost four of the last five games, are playing at their seat with Milton Kens in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller loses his life in order to freeze hundreds of air passengers from sea
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life in his attempt to ensure the safe departure of aircraft that carried hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were ignored because of a massive earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Several shipments continue to raid the area and many have been caught in ruins in the city of Paul.
However, even though his colleagues were trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gunwan Aung refused to leave his position at the control desk that was moving handy, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in its position to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was at the time of departure, could be safely landed.
Next, he got out of the control desk when he thought he was falling.
He died in the hospital later.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirett, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as the Australian television network ABC News later said.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimdan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to Paul's helicopter.
"We're confused with his death," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the dead can be thousands, while the country's disaster management service states that access to the towns of Dongala, Siggy and Butong are limited.
"The number of dead is expected to increase again, as many bodies are still under herpes, while many of these have not been able to reach them," said the representative of the type of service, Sioux-Nugarho.
The six - foot - long [six meters] steps destroyed Paul, which would end a mass grave in the sun.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute a patient brings bodies.
The clean water is low.
The mini market is stolen everywhere."
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Stargate in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Indonesian Stargate is fighting to save survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joe Woodonto, came to Paul on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work at night to get rid of any work related to expulsion.
Are you ready?" passed the CNN.
Indonesia was hit by a year earlier by earthquakes in Lompok, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Air Niugini says now that a man is ignored after the plane crash in Limne
The airline which carried out a flight meeting at a Pacific port in Micronesia is now reporting that a man is missing, while earlier he said that 47 passengers and payees had safely evacuated the floating aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release said that since Saturday evening it's not possible to find the pictures of a man in charge.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers for man identification.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the taxpayer, such as his age or nationality.
Regional vessels helped to dispose of other passengers and pay crews after the flight to the water as he was trying to reach the airport on the island of Czechoslovakia.
The authorities told Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and the situation was stable for all of them.
The demands of conflict and the exact similarity of events remain unclear.
Both the U.S. Air Company and the U.S. Navy said that the plane was added to the port outside of the approach route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was trying to approach.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that had reached them as midway to the emergency exits of the jet plane.
He said that the airport had been hit and they called and the same thing happened with a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some ships working nearby for the improvement of a ship were also helped to repair using a fishing boat to transport people to the coast before the ship landed within 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts between airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but in none of these conflicts, Air Niugini was involved.
An analyst leaves the night's schedule where a woman lives
H accused authority completed its purchase on Saturday at the repeated trial of a man who was charged with killing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Roulette has spent hours as an analyst in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the nuns how he used cell phone files to sequence the movements of the 29-year-old indicted Queen Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roulette said he got location files from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chembers on the night of her death, questioning his previous claims, as stated by the paper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Cebbers cell phone the time period that claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford was a witness on the Sabbath and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tallis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another argument was that Telis said he knew Chembers about two weeks before her death.
The drivers' files showed that they knew only one week.
Roulette said some time after the death of Chambers, Telis wrote down the messages, calls and communication details of Chambers from his phone.
"He drew it from his life," said Hail.
The surplus is going to start its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said that he estimated that later that day the trial would be brought to trial by the guilty.
The High Breed: What's the famous hip hop?
A third party wants to challenge the negative view it holds on the species by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breeds, from Bristol, claim that the hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip hop public again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Commons are experiencing a recent return to the United Kingdom through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black one?
Danda in New York is not married to her husband after she received a "racist" message.
A dance from New York is being conducted in marriage for a racist ending after she received a message that her mother sent where the last mentioned that the dance was "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist, comparing treatment with "expression".
Lynse Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new Danda Jigel Morris was black, only when the last appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
Mr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris and even twice.
As soon as she realized that her ship was on board, the mechanist now Mr. Plasco-Flaxman dissolved Mrs. Morris, saying that their passing blood, which was an African country, had not done any good work and was waiting for a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Mr. Morris received a salary for her one and a single day of work and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mr. Morris has taken action against the couple asking for compensation for the termination and has made compensation for the $350 class on the day for the trial period as an internal talent for which he had initially been arrested, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," said the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's about discrimination."
The couple objected to claims that they were racist, saying it was reasonable to dismiss Morris, since they feared that they would not be able to trust her again after they charged her.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," says Joel Plasco's husband in Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had attacked, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
Comparing treatment with "exhibit", Plasco said his wife was born just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you follow someone who is in this situation?
It's not so nice" added the bank investor.
While the legal case is under development, the Court of Justice of the Common Opinion has tried to judge the couple on social networks, judging them on their behaviour and logic.
The authors of Pandington feared that the consignors would not be interested in a voice speaking, as it reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It's so funny when you know what we know now about Pandington's great success."
She said that her father, who had worked as an iconist at BBC before being inspired to write the child book from a Lutheran archaeologist, was right for his work, adding that the 60th year of the publication of the book was "glycopic", since her father left the church.
Regarding Pandington, which describes him as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was a secret for his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't superseded," he said.
"But because Pandington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child that corrects something: you're too proud of it even though it's not your own fault in fact.
I think he saw Pandington's success somehow.
Although it was his own creation and his fantasy, he always gave signs to the same Pandington."
My daughter died and I had to tell her off the phone.
After the seizure, her daughter was transferred to Nikais Loui Paster 2 Hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nand kept calling me and told me that it was too bad, that he didn't have much hope of achieving it," said Mr. Endan-Laperuz.
"Sometime, Nand called me to tell me he was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to get rid of her.
And I did.
I said, "Yes, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly weakening her body and getting out of her body.
He had already died a few hours before and that time and now they're all gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it all happened.
I couldn't scream, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and the world.
I should've stayed cold."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperuz, who so far complains about her daughter's loss, was transferred to the airport along with other passengers who ignored the trial she was experiencing.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head down and they ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, it made me feel comfortable about Nand.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who are suffering from the loss of their own persons are carrying cards in their pockets to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put cards on a wall in Waalia with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call anyone to get support.
Mr. Davey's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel like I do every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, living in Lenny, said her son was a very promising boss, with a translatable smile.
"Everyone knew him thanks for his smile.
They always said his smile lighted the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died, since "he was in a very bad situation".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he finished his life.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm really worried there's gonna be an impact."
Mr. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there who you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't be silly - you need to talk."
Mr. Humphrey, who is a friend of Mr. Davis here for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt tired or stressed or something like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had caught half of the Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them in the eyes."
He said his death caused them a terrible injury, but they had to pass it: "The family is going to end.
It's bothering us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Bret Kavano's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting research.
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what she was asking - a limited length and limited object research - we might be able to bring a little unity," said Mr. Flick on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved through some of the cut-offs.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want to do research on the FBI?
Their memory loss is due to complete time-consuming.
Intermediate elections are held in only five weeks on 6 November and if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, they will be significantly weakened as regards their efforts to succeed in the election of the person they wish at the country's Supreme Court.
George Walker Boos calls Gerusians, urging them to support Mr. Kavano, who was working in the White House for Mr. Boos, and through this he met Asla's wife, who was Mr. Bois's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's report has been added?
A vote will take place in Russia, which is now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavano can take at least 50 votes in Georgia, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean residents falls under Kim's authority
The number of residents from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young won the power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean intelligence ministry, said 1,127 distances were noted last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest debts of persons involved were critical factors.
Pinging hasn't made public talks.
In the taxable majority of the residents of North Korea are finally offered the service of South Korea.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the borders since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them work through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross in comparison with the heavily protected Apostrophe between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be refugees and often ignores them for violence.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are usually still in war, have been improved in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Piongyang to discuss the peace negotiations that they have delayed.
This meeting was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trab and Kim Young One in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to cooperate to reverse the Korean leadership.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused US sanctions of missing progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we leave our country at least first," said Mr. Rim in his speech to the United States General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozie calls Bret Kavano "external", says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
The Democratic President of the Council of Representatives of Nansi Pelozi called for the petition for Supreme Court Brit Kavano "external" and said it was from a private crisis that he could not serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelozi made these comments at a meeting on Saturday in Texas Tribune Festival in the state of Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman was in this way, she would be called "external" by Pelozi on the case of Kavano before the Committee on Justice of Georgia on Friday.
Kavano, with a strong movement, rejected the charges that he had dealt with sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when he was both left.
When he was arrested, Kavano was deeply confused, and once almost shouted, and his voice was heard as he talked about his family and school years.
He also condemned the Democrats to the Committee, identifying the categories against him as "terrorist and coordinated political murder", organised by friends who have been offended by Hillary Clinton's fate in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozi stated that he believed that his case showed that he could not serve the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was accused of being a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
"I think he himself has excluded himself with these statements and with the way he has been made against Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozi responded when he was asked whether he would try to protest against Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats received most votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then it's not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he serves right now," Pelozi said.
Kavano is a judge at the Regional Court of the District of Colombia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Weind, as a conservative judge is considered.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavano refused to answer questions if he would allow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time to go to court to a strict, preposterous man and wait for us to say "it's not great?" Pelozie said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified abuse, months and years of age forget and can't get it out of its midst without damaging it.
"We cry when we remember," said Mr. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He kept saying, "It helped me very much a woman who was a thief somewhere, who said that she cried when she was injured, but she had developed a technique according to which when she fell and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm upset because I cry.
I'm angry."
And that's just how he kept going.
And it seemed great to me."
Degrees are allowed as a part of the barley crop because they are basically exposed.
One of my most intense memories of a job I did earlier, in an office where men ruled, is once I cried out with a lost ear and started out of the grave a larger woman - a cold director I always feared -- and pulled me into a rock.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're out.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy because they broke it."
Patricia Srenter, then a Democratic Senior of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidency army.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart agreed to have an extramarital relationship with a ship named Monkey Business (Bromodullia) and ended the battle, Mr. Render, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of setting up the same invitation for the presidency.
"It wasn't so wise," he said, rolling 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the course and the last thing needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Hyonat and the seven dragons."
Since the army had already begun here and for a while, it was back in funding and so it was hoped that it would not be in the course of the elections if it had not totaled $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave it $250.
"Do they think I have an excuse?" he wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that there would be no formal military action, she was very much burdened with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to concentrate money and target voters rather than for representatives and anger with sexism - which she felt a lot about.
"You'd think I had a neurotic cloning," recalls Mr. Render about the reactions of the guy against her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my partner.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my desk?
"Exactly"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can do good in Beijing
The congratulations of the U.S. and China's trade wars were overwhelming, and while the war still has much to do, a strike between the two countries can benefit from the Beijing long term, experts say.
American President Donald Trab created the first warning ball earlier this year by taxing basic Chinese export products, including solar panels, coal and aluminium.
This week, with new taxes imposed on types of US$ 200 million (150 million LL) in the substance by taxing half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Pekino returns the guns to species each time, while recently imposed taxes of up to five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to respond to the American guns and the world's second largest economy is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to make Washington subject, he should comply with their demands, but to persuade the U.S. in public would be too embarrassing for Si Jinping, China's president.
However, according to experts, if Pekino could play his cards correctly, the US pressure in the context of the trade war could have been positive for China for a long time with the reduction of the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a vital political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic training in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers have accepted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with a study center in Asia, at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be prepared for the sudden return of refugees and calls for assistance in the construction of the country's seven-year (and more) war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walden Al Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore stability.
All conditions are now met for the sudden return of refugees to the country where they were required to leave because of the terrorism and the minority economic measures that took place daily and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since 2011.
Other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Mualem said that aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country is welcome by the Government of Syria.
However, he stressed that it would not receive aid under conditions or aid from countries which supported the investigation.
Europe is keying the victory in the Capello Reinder in Paris
The European team won the Cup Reinter 2018, winning the US team with final score 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The U.S. team has been on 6 consecutive visits to European territory and has been winning the Küpello Ranger in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the first place again, as the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 degrees needed to win the United States.
The U.S. team's star Phil Michaelson, who fought hard during the biggest tournament, threw his ball into the water on the par-3 16th floor, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari took over all his rounds and thus became 1 of the 4 players who succeeded 5-0-0 since the modern form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was led to 57-4 from the lowest in the European team player category, Dano Thorbiorn Olsen.
The player with the best score in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Polter from England, who could play the last game in Kiello Rainter.
The Spanish veteran of eight Cypriots Rainer, Cergius Garcia, was the most successful European of all times in the tournament with a total of 25.5 degrees.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't keep it.
It was a difficult time.
I'm grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we took the hat back.
It's all about the group, and I'm glad I could help," said the mixed Greece after the European victory.
He gives the dog to John Ram's roommate, who won the U.S. golfer Tiger Gunts 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel amazing how I won Tiger Woods, I grew up to admire this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Hunts also lost his four games in France and now has a career director at Kiello Ranger 13-21-3.
I am inconsistency statistics for one of the biggest players of all ages, who has won 14 important titles and has just passed by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding a goal all weekend except Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tour.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his group's disappointment, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Some moments ago we got enough of Europe this morning.
We competed hard.
Welcome to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will resume, I will work with the US PGA and the Coalition Committee Reather and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to accept it.
They were better than us."
