I will lie down in bed during the night.
I'll be right here at 2:30 p.m.
I will be in Australia next week.
In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.
I'll get you some coffee in the cafeteria.
I have to go and see what I can do.
I'll never talk to you about my friends
I'll let you go.
Maybe I'll do what Tom did.
Let’s have a cup of tea.
Until you try your clothes, I'll turn my back on you.
I searched for my own treasure, but I could not find it.
I love the Internet.
I don’t love you.
But the doctor.
I am afraid that this will ever happen again.
I'm Microsoft's new employee.
I'm sorry.
Be positive, positive.
I am a European.
I'm driving this new car.
I am making all things new. ”

I moved to Australia.
I'm cute.
I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him. ”
You can't fight!
I'm going to sleep in a mazalia.
I know that she loved me very much.
I know they won't let us do this.
I don't know what to say to Tommy.
I am happy that I did.
I am afraid of drawing close to you.
I felt that I was being left out and that I was going to die.
I’m sorry, but I can’t stay long.
I'm sorry, I didn't think so.
I apologize for coming home, and I don’t feel ashamed of myself.
Forgive me if I have to.
Sorry, the menu doesn't support much of the help.
Sadly, I could not do much to help.
Even those who are grieving may not be able to give practical help
Sadly, though, that is not the case.
I know you are very sick.
I know.
Tom and John are convinced that they are working hard.
I built this house.
I'm the one who brought us into this war.
One of those who did just that was me.
I said that I should learn French.
I'm not a doctor.
I get really tired to prepare dinner tonight
I'm really tired tonight.
I have to get in.
I need to be careful.

Get in.
Gypsy.
Finally, we got our visas.
I opened my wallet, but it was empty.
I apologize to Tom
I’ve been wrong about my wife’s hair.
I read a book.
I really wanted to do that with you.
I really want you to get to know them.
I remember Tom and Mary having their baby.
I saw Tommy in the window, so I went back and greeted him.

I could see that Tom was down the street.
I saw Tom’s birth certificate.

I saw you on TV.
I saw you last Saturday.

Are you sure you want to move all items to their original location?
I had to go to the city to talk to the boy.
I tried to encourage Tom to wait.
I should've called Tom to do something like this.
I'm trying to explain everything to Tom.
Are all of them now resolved?
Is it possible to enter?
Can I come too?
Is it true that you have made this house your own?
Is he not your friend?
Is he not your friend?
I spent a lot of time learning French.
Is all this for you?

Would it not have been better?
Is there a place where I can take a bus?
Is there something you would like to do?
Is there room for harvesttime?
Is this not a very short work?
Is this door always shut?
Is that better?
I still have a strong feeling of self - worth.
Does Tom have any allergic reactions?
Is Tom the only one who knows what he is doing?
I studied French for three years.
I truly love Tommy
I don’t think he will.
Is your mother home right now?
It's mine.
It belongs to me.
He cannot be alone.
To do so, she did not have to spend much time together as a family.
A week later, I was conducting a Bible study with a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Once a week, I take advantage of the opportunity to give a witness in French to my friends.
I teach my friends French once a week.
I teach them French three times a week.
All of this was a serious mistake.
All of this was an internal error
That was in the past.
Over a year later, she was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
There is a difference.
That would help me to think about it.
It seems that everyone needs to learn another language.
I think I could do that on my own.

Staying at home can be very stressful.
Albert found it easier to study.

It is clear that Tom doesn't want to be here
It can be very difficult to control your temper.

My daughter Sami was devastated.
Sam was so moved by Leah’s love for her mother that he asked her to study the Bible with her.
Sam is able to do what he wants with his life.
Sam could hear that.
It can help you to cope.
I've never heard of anything.
