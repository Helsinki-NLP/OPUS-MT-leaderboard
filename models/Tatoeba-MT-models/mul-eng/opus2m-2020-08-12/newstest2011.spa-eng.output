What is it? The ČSSD in Prague does not know either Voldemort or the pastor.
The new councillors of the ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious linguistic barriers to the understanding of the components of the Prague Board and the municipal Council of Ministers of the ODS.
The current period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the signed slang language that has emerged in the Council in recent years when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The codified speaker who used Prague's flower and birth policy during the previous period, named Pavel Bém, includes some of the most known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been verified that the new councils do not almost understand those concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I am better a new politician in Prague," he said during the examination of "collegeo" terminology, the Lukáš Kaucký culture council.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Brézina reacted similarly.
Maybe they know the concept of "golf boy".
"Maybe it's the only expression of all you asked me to use at any time."
"Yes, normally I don't use slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktualné.cz last June before the ODS vote conference, the edition selected six examples, in particular those which are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "larger Gulf of Prague", "to the pastoral", "tortoise", "toll training" and "blonar".
Three councillors agreed to submit themselves to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who will in future be responsible for education in Prague, initially joined, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't care about these things and I don't want to appreciate how the democratic citizens are having fun."
"What matters to me is how we understand the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As it has been seen, the Concealel Lukáš Kaucký was apparently not aware that the previous title was an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of the excalcade Bém, Roman Janoushek.
Kaucky's word "Voldemort" has nothing to say to him; the only term he confirmed in the review is "the largest golf course in Prague".
"It's about the Blanca tunnel," says Kaucky, who immediately adds: "But I know better about the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," she smiles.
Karel Brézina is not the only one who recognises in the golf course the Blanca tunnel, but also the medieval Environment Concealel Lukaš Plachy.
Later, both sociodemocrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukáš Plachy even know where to find that character; he also suspects the meaning of "go to the pastoral."
"I believe it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it reveals to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janoushek's companies.
Like Brézina, it shows that such knowledge received the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the trial, there is no such family glossary of local terms among the socio-democrats.
"I asked my friends, but it really doesn't seem like anything."
"Well, we use apods, sometimes shorts or we do games with names," says the president of the ČSSD pragunese, Petr Hulinský, whose party associates call Hilda.
"In the college they called me Bríza, but I don't know if my friends also call me so," he confides himself to Karel Brézina.
The journal Current.cz tested the number and works.
For its party partners, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dédek ("way"), the representative Miroslav Poche, who was associated before the fake elections during the party's sponsorship, receives "Igraček" (playmobile) adage from some of its partners.
The apocalypse is also the only expressions that socio-democracys tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hilda, but the newspaper Atualné.cz has also discovered other posters for this president.
"The doctor of the rights of the bear" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský received his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "brujas", as published in a newsletter
Women who are considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They often have advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
Women who are "resurrection" witches are sent to an isolated area so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer so much."
"It is also not easy for healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," explains a world that, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to resist this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information paper that should help to avoid the hunting of bears.
However, this has a trap.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Bribery charges are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, last week Amy Hemmah died at 72 years of age when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a poor set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was taken into the oil used for ritual union.
He was taken in calls when the group wanted to "evict the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "brujas" supports people from all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The human souls exploiters have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the Government was trying to rape the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still taking part in it.
"After his uncle's death, the Gambian President Jammeh launched a broad hunting of witches who were supposed to have been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"To help you bring to the attention of the neighbouring Guinea who, protected by the police, military and the president's personal hearing, were brought to force by elected men and women randomly among the Gambian peoples to the ownership of the President in Kanilai," she said in her report to the International Amnesty Organization.
At the end, persons arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with alucinogen effects that also caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the prisoners did not survive the stay in the prison.
After international pressure, about a thousand persons were finally released.
The tenant of Babala: warms with carbon bags and sign a higher rental
The man, advanced and rejected, crossed the doors of the customer centre of the company RPG Byty of the "carbon Magnate" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of floors in renting in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm he carried documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his son, his daughter and his son, who is carrying out the sentence.
The three of them just took over the liberalisation of the rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from the next year 4,100 crowns for a double floor with separate kitchen from second category.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows the man with his finger in his son's new contract, on which he has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains the angry medium, the designated medium.
The BytyOKD.cz civil society, which has qualified the new conditions for rent as "inaccurate and inaccurate", recommends that tenants who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, will publish a guide on how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, the man just does one more thing.
"Every thing that says something," she says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of evidence of liberalisation.
After New Year it will take place with the large majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were still under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Currently.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of Ostrava's four and, Tuesday to the nine, was already full.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and on their side a machine to take number.
"Aquiler 2011", can be read in a light button of your touch screen.
When you press it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
It almost doesn't take time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the car.
Shortly afterward, an advanced age marriage arrives to ask questions, but the room's machetum is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for solutions, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava at the bison of the tenants of most 44,000 RPGs in mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase in the rent between 15 and 38 per cent.
On 18 November a special window was opened at the customer centre for new rentals.
"It works for a week, so it's starting," they answer, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the customer is presenting as a journalist.
Liberalization and the old floors for Bakala miners are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of Parliament, Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, has already addressed them high and clear, and they are now constantly appearing in the newspapers of the area.
" Twenty years later I want a new land."
"They didn't change the damn plate of the bathroom," the man mentioned at the introduction was dismissed.
According to the workers, there are currently more than enough employees to check if they get a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the "liberalization" window is definitely not able to teach the gap of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they were only asked about the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the ventilator.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties fail to reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge shall address the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information on the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," warned RPG on its pages.
"There's no one going to judge here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who's on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives him at least part of the reason.
"I get 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left for food; I don't have any means to get to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee seems to have doubts.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warned them on the means they didn't sign, so maybe people hope," he said.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rentals still do not cover even the amount necessary for the maintenance of the community's fund," recalls Pavel Klimès, director of the company's resident portfolio RPG Byty, who adds that the neglect of the community's fund that engulfs tenants is the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, the figure will increase to 5,200 million.
The large screen covering the roof, in front of the sittings of the waiting room, now repeats some data that are highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 in 15% and less applies to 3.1200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7,50 monthly checkes per square metre," is indicated on the screen.
This only increases by 38% the 400-piece rental of the RPG card.
"In such cases, this is an increase from some extremely low quantities, of 19,66 kroner per square metre," says RPG.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not impact hits on the tenants, but will be scaled between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the renter's rise (see graph) again in the floors, mainly in heating storage: new windows and heating.
They shall have priority for those who sign the above-mentioned rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need guards.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides within it a small garden with everything to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park in the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can join her.
The Architectural Project Company Arch.Design, whose study drew out many well-known buildings from Brno, thought from the first pieces of the Avriopoint building to include space for its mini-guard.
About 90 people work in the company, mostly at the age of baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Together with the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the watch is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers to its employees under its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with child care.
The Ministry was an idea of Arch.Design's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's Ministry of Finance is funded through the European Social Fund under the operational programme for human and employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding is completed (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to keep the mini-guard with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the submission of the funding application contributed to the Economic Rating company.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, they are present every day for their care by a nurse and teacher of the Ministry of Education. The care is currently available to children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since this is a "miniguard", it is only possible to accommodate a maximum of five children at the same time, although with shifts they do more during the day.
It is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers who have the same right to use the care, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the pre-school education programme is comparable to that of the regular pre-school programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic education to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class has not only games and table games but also computers for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of getting late from school when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this kind of relationship naturally forms a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support for the family and, finally, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Watch the interiors of Gaudí
The tejado looks like the hole of a prehistoric lagarto, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur and the balcony looks like the mouth of an open piece.
This is the Batlló House, Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar shape to a skeleton, the locals attached it to "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its callative colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of steel and mosaics, a façade that reminds you of smoothly curved scales and omnipresent lines, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's section.
The door of the house plays with unique lines, delicate colors and textures removed from nature and fashion.
More attention is paid to a certain geometry, rhythm and careful thought order.
At night, the whole façade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is lit in such a way that the light of the colors improves.
Serpentea and the torture of the forms continue to surprise us in its interior as well.
The ondold wood copies the frames of windows, bars, doors decorations, mirrors and letters.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 of the encouraged Paseig de Gracia trade street, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the industrial richest Joseph Batlló, initially insisted on removing the previous building and starting with zero, but soon he accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, formed by various apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Joseph María Jujol worked in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project, decorations emerged for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
Other artists and artists also worked in the factory.
Co-operation in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milla House and the Güell de Gaudí park, where other parts of it are located.
Because of its organic form, the locals soon after its completion adopted "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows they began to call it "the house of bushes".
It is also said that, at the height of the construction, there is the sword of San Jorge, the patron of Catalunia.
Other structural elements of construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudí designed at home a unique system for central heating time with ventilation fans and typical fireplaces.
It can result in a strange inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not fully respect the construction standards of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction obtained the relevant permission from the beginning, although it clearly contained the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the assembly was so affected by the result that it requested to be corrected.
For example, he worried that construction would include columns even to the public square.
The arrangements have never been made, but on the contrary: only five days after the application for assembly, Joseph Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed in the lower floors.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and in the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The floor floor was rented for a joy.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a ladder that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be contacted in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy required for closer conversation.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only obtained a new façade but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It also works amazing how Gaudí plays with light, white olives and blues that cover the interior floor and tragaluces.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light in all the rooms of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which was added in 2005 to the World Heritage List of the Unesco Humanity.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and more affordable apartment for the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous Creator.
Visits confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very useful business and extended visits to the common area and to the bohardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not significant, reaching €16.50, although students, employees and tourist cards owners get 20% discount.
The amount exceeds considerably the price of the entrance of other buildings in the city of Gaudí.
If you want to enjoy the real bed environment with its lagarto towers, you should make friends quickly from a neighbor's house and visit him at home.
How to choose the pick and the shadow: women and men are looking for different things
None of a pumping frame for the bed; what really entrusts its quality to a good bed is the surface to melt, i.e. the collection and the shade.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election many elements enter into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which the cocoon and the soybean are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend weekend that does not usually have heating, latex drops should not be used because they "heat" slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than normal polyurethane collets.
It is therefore necessary to give them the most frequent return.
If the channels of the centre are not properly aired and, above all, they are on a firm basis, they keep in moisture. They may even appear low.
At the time of choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad, often using a very high cocoon with a pale layer and will have problems to feel well on a lower and tougher surface.
" Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their machatated hombres, thalches and cadres they needed stitches with a glass of viscoelastic. "
"This type of colloquium is also recommended for people with diabetes who are experiencing nervous system problems, so they get information about articulations and skin," explains Sylva Hadamčeková, who specializes in the attached furniture.
Many hockey players, like other clients, take time preferring viscoels.
"There is no problem today, because they have these appropriate Tempur and the Magniflex Italians, but also the Czech Tropical brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player anymore to appreciate viscoelastics.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat or adapt to your body temperature.
There is no pressure; during the night, it won't give you back as soon as after a hard game.
Just, I'm better at it.
The viscoelastic also works as a protection against lakes.
When you choose the size of the collection, add to your height the length of your feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be in a double room of 90 cm, total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example single rooms, it is recommended as a minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: at the top of the mouth, it should have comfortable hands attached to the codes," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čaluníkóníkó a decorationist, who has been busy for many years with the problem of healthy dream and ergonomics of the furniture, a theme he teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own shade and cot, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the cots.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the shadows at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Spum stems should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models within walls of a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres are for the layer that adapts to shapes and smoothness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you rest in your neck, you should certainly not notice the mussels," warned Helena Prokopová.
Each column requires a particular type of shadow.
The fully-equipped bedrooms, in which the collection and base are like monkeys, do not make sense in the bedroom.
The hills breathe badly and cannot wash their foundations, which today is often done.
And since each night we cross between 0.2 and 0.75 l of the south, it is clear that after about five or seven years the collection will begin to remind us of a big (and congested) tamsi.
For this reason, specialists reject the slogans that speak of a life of a collection of up to 25 years or, even, a life-sustainment.
However, everything has one man.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: in the hills with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the foundation, but better add a collector that can easily be removed and washed.
Although foundations are currently being made with cremation closure throughout its perimeter, so at the opening they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and washing size!), their manipulation in larger models (and for one person) when raising the neck may seem a struggle between a muscle weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somber, do you have a firm table?
Never!
How much for the beds you're thinking about to spend one night visiting.
However, you must make (if you don't already have them) ventilating syringes on the table and use with a housing with an inner ring and a minimum height of 15 cm with the bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a blind layer.
Polyurethane cells should not be used on such bases.
For non-articular blades with between 14 and 18 blades, latex or sandwich collars can be used (for example, a combination of latex and cocofibra), although it is always better a shadow with a larger number of blades, 28 or more, where the blades of the lamp area are strengthened and their rigidity can be regulated.
Soybeans of artificial laminates should not be used with a bunch of molluscs, since it does not react to reclination.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the legs which enables them to push or even to tilt the legs so that they "route" perfectly to the limbs during sleep.
For men with very large limbs, it's a very important thing.
Even they are remembered by the coal manufacturers who, in the "mousculins", began to use a more denser area just around the men.
Women are also reminded, for whom they place a more flexible area around the chairs.
For the most demanding customers, there are shadows with cross-structure or tables with the so-called multi-tortion amortization.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
It must also be borne in mind that, although it uses the appropriate harvest and shade, if it uses a bad malt (large and "mulilla"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the comfort should sustain the head and the corners can only reach the limbs, so that the muscles of the same person can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the top of the side tip, the softness should be at the same level (when combined with the shade with strength for homs or the softest area of the neck) than the height of the homs.
Modern beads have something to look at, it seems, with the original beads filled with land.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, they're fashionable biological cells.
The raw materials based on oil, which manufactures polyurethane foam, are filled with natural oils such as rice or soya.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biologically, in the case of hills, means that the centre is made of only natural materials," explains Petr Vasiček of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the base of the stems, one of the first real aloe.
But it can also be chosen by microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to the forest or laundry.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "freshened" with vegetarian extracts of spray, so that the base of the colchon absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the base.
The red drink extract improves the circulation of blood so that women feel better.
The current favorites?
Cold espum stems, which are more porous, with an adaptable cell structure, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and visco-viscoelastic foam rigids allows you to make poles from different areas that know perfectly where your head, your shoulders and your knees are going.
A good quality necklace will cost him seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function often have a lower IVA, since they are considered health means.
The first I got this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save in the hills and shadows.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which at times offer two colossaries at the price of one.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers Duofreeze dolls with an espum with memory attached to the base for 11,990 crowns.
The second gets free.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially, it emerged as a material for NASA, since during the discharges the astronauts were subjected to a massive overload.
Time is filled with heat and continues with cold.
Consequently, the human body, warm, has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent lakes from being produced, although also to improve the comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only in the trunks but also for health products, for example for comforts placed under the legs and alivians, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally intended for vehicle tracking, can also follow people's movement and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a cell box, but soon it will be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the disappearance of Anička and began to learn about the means available to protect their children better.
Even the cost of invasive your privacy.
"We all try to say that it is not about spying but about another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," considers Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices may be abused, for example if they are placed in someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what "cajita" is and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to take it, he'll just shoot it.
"Even the youngest children show great creativity at the time of the deliberate loss of certain things if they want to avoid them."
"In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be shut down as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In its opinion, it is possible to discuss whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If this is a planned kidnapping, the author will practically always check whether the child is carrying any type of electronic device that can reveal his or her location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is going to expand, he will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with much publicity."
"In such cases, criminals are always taking a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence may be helpful.
"The device may be configured to send the position regularly after a given period".
"If you suffer harm, it will at least facilitate the final position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices have been integrated into a tilting measure, so if the person is simply lifted up and left in motion, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Čech.
In its opinion, a service of this kind can be obtained even with intelligent mobile phones with navigation, in which a special software should be installed.
The problem of the current tracking units is that it is currently dealing with devices of a size similar to a cell box or mobile phones of a smaller size.
So they can lose.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason evidence is currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"What identifies it after a certain time, which can make the police take time," he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are taken into the sink or sink, they will continue to use the same technology used to track vehicles.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in normal car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mice to round all of Chequia. But they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to take explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres to its arsenal.
They are therefore 225 years old.
The problem is that the mecha's useful life is two years, four to the sum.
The army bought the match for explosives to the STV Group, i.e. for forty million crowns.
The staff of the General responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha, saying that soldiers needed 60 kilometres of mecha training per year.
According to the army's pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it was decided, however, that such operations should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year as well as all senior officials, including secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions from either the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondr and the army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only so could it be justified that the army spends 60 miles of mecha.
That length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
However, the army would have sufficient existences for more than ten years.
On the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional, the army would have a new purchase (including adding the consumption of engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 previously indicated.
Soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally shortly before Minister Vondra because they say they only have ammunition for various weapons, so they are limited even to shooting practices for money.
And we're not talking about the lack of inner clothing.
"And I can't understand that we get such amounts of mecha again."
"But it's your decision and they will no doubt know why they act like this."
"For us, the army is a good client who, as a company, we are trying to satisfy," admits STV Group's commercial director, Jan Däcky.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek also defends hundreds of miles of mecha saying it will have existence of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Däcky, from STV Group, points out that the match has only one useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, for two years.
"If it is stored under perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of possible military criticism, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains faithful and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that by buying 445 kilometres of mecha, I received a discount.
"We were about 60% less than last year's request of 244 kilometres," said Pejšek of the Ministry of Defence shopping centre.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the munitions of World War II or left by the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 metres a year.
Furthermore, the police always only ask for the right amount as to remove the ammunition before it ends its useful life.
They decided it for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and also, while they can achieve more modern and reliable types of mesh.
The Ministry has already had clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rin.
According to the pyrotechnics who spoke with MF DNES, after a few years the following problem will arise with the current: it will have to be eliminated hundreds of miles from the old mega, which is now being bought "barata".
So far I continue to live with the contacts I have received through the competition
The fact of winning the "Ampresario of the Year" competition helped Lukaš Pytloun to sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition won the competition "Emprestor of the Year" by 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His history of success seems to come out of a movie.
And Lukaš Pytloun liked to travel.
Foreigners were aware that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he had collected with fixed work abroad and a bank credit he bought a house that was half-lost composed of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really valid.
"At present, the quality-value relationship of accommodation in our area has moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first repaired floor for foreign workers.
All the income he had gained from the reinvestment in the building, which gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has been able to open up a little bit in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
However, this year opened up another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a franchise of Pytloun," said the businessman number one of the last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses helped greatly to win the competition of the 'Emprey of the Year'," adds Pytloun grateful.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and around.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant," she recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends to all the world that it would try to take part in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that until now he continues to live in contact and know that, without the competition, he might not have obtained it.
"With some people I met with thanks to the competition I started to work normally."
The fame associated with success, in its opinion, also included employees,
In total around 70.
"I have seen them show more loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has received general recognition."
"It's not, not much less, my own personal success, but the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It's just my name that appears in the first plan," says Lukaš Pytloun in a modest way today.
My successor wants him a more quiet year than we've had on Farmet.
The euphoria for the victory soon broke apart because of the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the firm Farmet, Karel Ždáarský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Emprey of the Year", last year in Prague's "Casa Slava".
The jury appreciated its efforts, with which it was able to turn a small technical workshop into Česká Skalice into a signature with a volume of hundreds of millions of businesses.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me but all my colleagues and improved our confidence in combating competition," said the winner of last year.
The history of Farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Ždáarský's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the sale of properties during communism, he did not doubt it too much; he gave up his position in the company where he worked and, with a few associates, founded the company with his father of plastic piles.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in plant oil printing.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic printing in the centre of Europe.
They also gained greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to consider the brand Farmet as much better, but foreign partners also began to value collaboration with a company that had a greater success in their country," says Karel Ždáarský.
Last year maybe Farmet wasn't just an example of the euphoria of victory.
I also received recognition for the commercial results by 2008 and, in part, for 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, has caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"Of course, we do not get rid of this situation either."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some demands," Karel Ždáarský explains.
A viable company must, on occasion, take even less popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's gains, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs was research and development.
"With grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence of the international market and gained great appreciation for national holidays," says Ždáarský.
Everything indicates that they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring about a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žžăarský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
Some ridiculous rules have already been removed.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring documents to the administration to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the trade register, although its staff could obtain it with two motions from the mouse.
Thanks to the investigation, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it takes control of the insurance tax," ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buranová said.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations which must be respected by companies and businesses in Chequia and to try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms the fourth part of the business tournament of the publication Homóřské noviny and begins to create affection among the general public as well.
While last year's edition contained the participation of 3,000 voters, this year reached almost four thousand.
And it doesn't seem surprising, because we still have several legal obligations over which they should simply be respected for trade.
"No matter how many papers necessary for the tax declaration we are first in the world," comments Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Enterprises of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement is particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for holding a company, Chequia is in position 74a, i.e. eight worse positions than last year.
The Absurdez competition for the year was held for the first time in 2006 and was repeated each year.
Any person may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and end of September when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterward, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "antipremium" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Get the nonsense that gets more votes.
For this year's investigation, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that did not make sense.
Examples sent them both to business and to professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and buses pay the pehe or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held early in November at the Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and social people are often involved.
This year, for example, they participated in this act of the competition Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to work for businesses, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessary," Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek announced.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in waste water.
In 2007, what was most disturbing to people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days before the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to take a job at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed from the new industrial law.
The obligation which ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the office of employment by its foreign workers on work trips for up to 30 days, was removed from the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is going to win.
The 2009 Absurdez was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a snow and two ground bascules.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a baby.
A new category recognises corporate social responsibility
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The news in this fifth edition of the Homóřské novely competition is the so-called Company responsible for 2010.
The aim of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that are involved in the impact of their activities on the environment and which support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, the organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the annual rebellion.
For this new special sub-categories of this year's edition of Vodafone's main competition The 2010 Company presented companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities vary entirely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, this is the case for persons with disabilities, other than the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the entire Republic, for example, the company asked for Et Netera software, which supported the training of informal sports teams among its employees, which then participated in various sports tournaments.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main fund contributor to the support of disabled children for seven years.
In Podébrad, there is a paper which is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they represent more than 70 per cent of the template; therefore, it received the title of the company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the MiRiz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even under the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title has also been given because it buys Czech manufacturers priority, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities produce the least possible environmental impact," explains company Milushhe Ryzarová.
The responsible TI Enlogit from the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keys; it also supports work from home and in its business events uses catering services from a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the well-being of Apouros, which helps in particular the local Roman community," commented the representative of Ondréj Suchiy.
They are also located in a good place with a reference to the Praní laundry company in the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive special benefits that affect their pension funds.
"We benefit from food, transport, improvement of qualifications and oxygen," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
The category of Company responsible for the year was automatically designed for all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year which responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or erroneous.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not respond to the questions, they could not participate in the company's annual competition, but were not qualified for the "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as this is a sub-categories of the company's main competition for the year," explains Karel Goldman of counsel Bison & Rose.
Police arrested during a public substation in the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out several arrests in the construction of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
The detectives married a local media sector entrepreneur and the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It seems that this attempt to manipulate a current public subsidisation for the restoration of rights so that the subsidized land receives a precise interest.
I should have paid Luboš G. half a million crowns for that.
"For the moment only I can say that the police are looking for a person for a bribe during a public hearing and a public tender," said Pravo, chief of the prosecutor general of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that he cannot currently disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the police left the 46-year-old businessman.
About how I could influence the public sub-public, given little official information, it is only possible to speculate.
The spokesman for the Lubomíra Cherná Agricultural Fund answered Pravo's questions saying that the police were actually carrying out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public hearing.
"It's a client, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public substation is called "Convocation for the submission of proposals for land transfer in accordance with the Land Act" and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a higher value than their refund, which must be transferred before the land value is announced."
"On the basis of the tenders, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the biggest offer" explained the Fund's spokesman.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to be presented to the summons and, since he is currently an interested person because he has acquired several reparation rights, he proposed to interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the appeal.
Please, it was covering a commission.
This would explain that at the time of the arrest there was so much money up there.
Luboš G. had special contacts with the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former chief of PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with decommissioning the replacement of lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund some land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the area where a large road should be built to the industrial area of Borská pole.
Then he changed them very well with the judge by a house in the city’s own historic center with a very higher value.
In this case, the assembly had to intervene because, on the contrary, blocked areas would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to get out of the paper, starting from January, several hundred crowns per month more than now.
The electricity price increases by 4.6 per cent, the gas around 2 per cent, in some cities up to 10% more by water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to some 100 crowns more than this year.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, due to increased support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic.
However, gas is moderately controlled, especially when heating is used more and therefore more is consumption.
In this case, they should also count with a few hundred crowns more than a year.
While electricity and gas are all over the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will pay from January to January for central heating some 50 crowns per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
The residents of Prague will also have to bear a 9 per cent increase in water price and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't vary, the Pragues will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 rented floors in Prague can be considerably increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns in Ustí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company shall bring to courts those who are not in agreement with the new rental.
Regular rentals, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get bored with Fernet and Ron. The beer is no longer so, because it works slowly
Fernet, iron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the alcoholics who end up taking care of young alcoholics who are under the age of 15.
The children who have died in the hospital constantly to overcome the scars are no longer an exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors who are in such cases in hospital petition admissions.
"Bird beer is no longer fashionable, because they're too late to burrow them."
"Now the fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," he told Pravo, the head of the Hospital Horíovice pediatric in central Bohemia, Luděk Pelikán.
"When they're able to take a bottle to their alacon's father, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of joining with zuma and not smelling so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the voice of the University of Motol Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually about Fernet or Ron."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among students."
"In some cases, they use waiters who took it home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are drunk for forty years who often appear in hospitals.
Before Horíovice, where he has worked since this year, he has worked for a decade in the pediatric in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in about four times."
"It started at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture of ecstasy," the doctor of the department said.
"It was at Holešovic's holiday at some dance party."
"It's interesting that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of the increase in the consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is impossible to speak of independence itself.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is well due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelicán.
According to Jurinová spokesman, this year at Motol’s paediatric clinic, 40 Hebrew children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who experience serious intoxication and must remain in the hospital.
The young alcoholics who, after the ambulatory medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police do not belong.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink waiting, there are three stations for Pelikán that should be mentioned: the day of the wedding, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink by bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"On the day of the storm I came to see up to seven Hebrew children at once," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that they do not suffer a terrible strain at home the next day.
The sudden headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a sororine with glucose and by nutrients that are missing from the body.
"These bring it much better, because after the night's set, they'll wake up well and don't regret anything."
"Only confusion about where they are is shown," Pelikán points out, adding that patients often lose good sense at least when they see the costs they have generated.
The transfer of ambulances and hospitalization into a room for serious patients costs a tens of thousands of crowns.
"I've often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I'm visiting them directly to tell the children how much their pregnancy has cost and that they should spend the whole evening on a job for young people so you can earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in its opinion, may be a retroactive measure, which often brings back to people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes meet for the first time in the hands of geniuses in Spain
Two L-159 planes of a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It's the first time a device of this kind is in the hands of someone who's not the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to carry out practice or demonstration flights.
This is the version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech army and was still able to fly.
The remaining three planes are L-159 monoplaza.
These are still kept in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, which was already charged with them last week.
Jan Pejesk, of the Department of Defense Press, indicates that it is still unknown when the physically withdrawn planes from Vodochody are being withdrawn.
"The L-159 monoplaza aircraft were, in turn, separated from the refurbished aircraft long ago, without additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 bill was exchanged in its current state," said Law Pejšek.
He added that the army was not left without biblaza aircraft, since in May 2009, the army signed a contract with Air Vodochody for a total of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-required biblas.
One of the new aircraft has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some associated countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve the practices of NATO pilots."
"So, it depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," Pejšek says.
The Homórské newspaper published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a house plane and the purchase of other three aircraft for 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to purchase and negotiate directly with EADS.
The current defence management claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech army acquired Air 72 aircraft and only used 24 so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of planes Home may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should select aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three planes from Casa and the last one should arrive at Kbely's airport within fourteen days.
A finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the canceler are subject to a lower risk of suffering prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a Wednesday study published in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of breast cancer, especially for men under 60 years of age," said the author of the study Ross Eeles, professor of cancer research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the tooth could help determine which men should be subjected to a prostate cancer test, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors such as family health problems, according to Eiles.
During the period 1994-2009, the follow-up was conducted with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than cancel.
They presented the same probability of suffering prostate cancer as 19 per cent of those whose teeth were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the annual finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men with less than 60 per cent age, the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two teeth in question, established in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the foetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Páčes, told ČTK that he knew the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between the length of teeth and cancer can be "exactly demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, like most of Europe, was wearing snow-covered Thursdays.
The roads and steels are mainly covered by compact snow and the quitanive machines traveled all night through numerous areas.
In the morning, D5 was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several industrial vehicles and tourism accidents, as was D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotive Club (UAMK).
At 91 km there was a truck, two industrial vehicles were fired in 93.
Several tourists also ended up in the kitchen.
There are also problems on the D1 road in the 185 km towards Prague.
There they shot two trucks.
Drivers must cycle slowly after Brno in 190 km or through Brno and integrate into 182 km in Kývalce.
There's been a couple of miles together.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimetres and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming attachments for example in Prosek, although they are also congested by Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the meter.
The trains travel with delay, for example on the line between Karlov's village and the village of Miru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
Problems also affect railways and airports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections three times.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what is the current situation.
Ruzynia airport closed from 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday till 5:00 a.m.
At present, you can now travel by most of the streets of South Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed, in Brnínska are forming snow languages and in Blanenska there is a need for chains to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
To date, the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They'll need coolers to get rid of them.
At the moment you can't say when you're going to open up to the movement.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathy (White Carpathies).
The roads in the region, which, given a protected natural area, should simply be left in inert state, are collected up to five centimetres of snow, according to the ČTK.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimetres of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, they fell about 15 inches [15 cm] of snow.
The Nevadas gradually return to Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "intellectual weapon"
The American army is using a new "intellectual" weapon in Afghanistan, known for now only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "the progress of the game" will have won.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise score.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains causes it to actually work as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to operate not only when they hit the target but at any point in their ballistic trail.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
No doubt, normal protection can not be used and, when the rain of metallic steel is released, it can become essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for childhood that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it so that they find the target, point to their laser radius, which determines the distance, then gets a precise perspective and, according to the same thing, corrects the projection line and closes the trigger."
"Let's say it's measured 543 meters."
"When the battalion is pushed, the weapon is loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters, at least one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu Consortium moved its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Consortium Fujitsu moved its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the manager of the computer sector and its maintenance of Wednesdays, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of the following year from their former office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large complex of offices in the Lyoner Straße street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesman from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, more than 100 other employees of the Consortium, previously deployed by the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the company office in Astro Park will promote the way to work for employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Neiderrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection with the airport is very important at present for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region brought joy to those who were in favour of and disappointment to those who were opposed.
The head of Frankfurt Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has resulted in a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost to Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The direction first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korvisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
At the end and at the end, economic reasons produced the decline.
Thus, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and the contractor of the building are cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the nearby "Kleine Verticale" were part of the overcrowded buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project in the city of Balnearian.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the assembly, a new entry is being made to the city, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that was previously used as parking times and the level of buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and tax companies were installed, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer factory house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Cancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest international supplier of TI.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides needed services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branches in this area will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
Thus, 7,000 square metres of rent have been rented at Astro Park's office building.
The old 20-year-old complex, whose name is based on its star form, is hosted among others by the central electronics and electronic industry.
Amazon Cancels the Server - Threats to Assange
The anxiety is absorbed more and more by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the display platform of your server.
There may be political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the whiteest of critics, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet heritage in Europe.
The famous American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies on Wikileaks' ticket.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people seeking Interpol, must remain detained in Great Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks fired from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations through the Twitter news service announced Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its server.
Internet activists had been using the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon web of services in order to cope with the high access figures for documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we're going to spend our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using his server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported CNN chain according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the country's Security Council had threatened Amazon with boicot, reported the British Guardian.
"I wish that Amazon would take these measures before, before the previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikilaks' illegal, monstrous and unconsidered process puts our national security in play and threatens life in the world," he said in an independent senator's communiqué.
"No company responsible, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is searched in Sweden for suspicion of rape, is on the list of people seeking Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian is detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently qualified research in Sweden as a trap of his enemy.
Wikileaks' spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, said Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undiscovered.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America's statements.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that Wikileaks should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, a head of government adviser Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there is a great debate.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for American President Barack Obama, qualified for "rebellious and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the State Secretary, if she is responsible for organizing recent diplomats involved in spying.
"I'm not quite sure why we should import a guy's opinion with a web page," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional post, announced the White House.
For this reason, Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the total information on the Government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to be responsible for the security of the dissidents and activists, Wikileaks' publication should be put at risk.
"We have done our best to contact them," said the spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of ice cream
In "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future heroes has the greatest influence and visitors around the world.
In fact, where's all the ice cream coming from?
The ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream prepares cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream.
The gelatium removes the cream from the shower's ice cream with a spatula, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola del Emilia in the province of Bolonia.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the University of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that ice cream from his machines meets the Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future heroes has the greatest influence and visitors around the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the home helder.
In these times of crisis, some dream with a new career, others risk in the mild ice cream of their vagabonds.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and wants to offer a European quality product on the soil of industrial ice.
Andke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something for himself in a few years in an exciting job.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening a hall in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice creams of his bars, and a Canadian home lover, Julia, comes because his children love Italian ice cream.
The Helder Master Luciano Ferrari later explains to participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is determined not only by its good taste but also by its sedative susceptibility and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the birth cover of the national top house and mainly south of the country: "Italian ice cream is just the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the development seems to be easy.
Luciano takes the basic ingredients: milk, milk, milk in powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large bottle, which warms everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently freezes it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine's flu and release a pasteurized white base cream, the base for all types of ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be developed only with natural elements or without stability?
How can you give some tasteless laughs?
Luciano advises that they avoid the trends of the time.
What's about ice cream "in only natural ingredients" has best been used by stabilisers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber guar, of frijol guar.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, only one day you have to buy it, put it in a bag and the customer will kill a sound of granite.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
They're using aromas.
With regard to the taste of ice, Professor Luciano distinguishes the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
In addition, there are dust and pastries.
"All suppliers will try to end aromatized ingredients in their goods."
"But they have to experience it sometimes."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will turn into a yellow cream and with powdered cocoa as a basis for all possible chocolate tastes.
Now the participants in the course can use the heaters.
Luciano allows them to produce four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, molasses and apples, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better does not necessarily depend on having more flavor of tofu or pure fruit.
It is not necessary that the vegetarian gelate separates dry fruit, if it contains more vegetarians.
The working group develops the kiwi iced worship, which uses more fruit, less water and something less stabilizer.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is an artimetic problem: If the pure melocoton is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano removes a tool with which it determines the amount of sugar of the fruit types (medium of the viniculator for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice does not require more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for automatic preparation of the basic mass.
There is also a tool in which the mixture of prepared ice is struck at the same time and is frozen at low temperatures.
Nevertheless, all automation remains outside of the small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo is missing himself and his companions from the top with pure fruit, as if it were a giant minor without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that goes on."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has been involved in the industry experienced by transgenic plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institution for independent biotechnology impact assessment.
"There seems to be a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert has also been hired for years in the Ilsi Association.
Consorties like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly cooperated with Efsa's genetically modified plant testing standards, which puts him in a clear conflict of interests, critical then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time Testbiotech criticises a coalition of interests.
Thus, shortly ago a high-ranking manager of Ephesus was unable to support or pass on to Swiss Agrikonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that his band.
A short time ago, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were conducted by the General Environment Office as well as by an EU parliamentary clerk.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
It applies to all formal data, including some of the industry, whenever they are of high quality and technical quality, they are listed in a report.
Experts working in Ephesus are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they have to expose these contacts.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is referred to itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the risk assessment of biotechnology without Lobby's task.
In this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the fact that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that genetically modified plants do not control the influence of the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, does the genetically modified corn in agriculture," then says.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" asks the prosecutor, then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientific has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or mistrust critical scientists in the United States and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For companies, critical studies are not published in general.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, totaling about 400 pounds.
The moon was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on the back.
There have been demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the diggers arrived and began to dig a large hole in the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart has never been the same again: Thousands and thousands have shown themselves against the S21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was painted, most of the needle was made of shells.
It's 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a slender yellow stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are abandoned."
"They shouldn't disappear."
It is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he has oiled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier warehouse of ammunitions of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen raised his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"I'd be embarrassed, they'd hurt the gravel or send it to the basement," he says in his office, a wooden case that once was a guard case.
They insulted him and threatened him, explained when in September he appeared in the newspapers that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the waste company.
He spoke to his 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that I couldn't do absolutely anything about it.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to use.
About 200 S21's enemies took the 80 kilograms cut, with a price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to bring it back into a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a while.
Owner of gardens, landscaper, project manager.
They came from all sides and carried what they could carry on the carpet and up.
The stuttgart stone of the impulse has been converted into "the wall" or the limitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He climbs all over his territory, making a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested him in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a rock lover.
Located at 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its assets all over Germany.
He says he's the best old stone dealer in the country.
Frena.
In the snow there are artistic stones of spicy sand.
"They survived at Dresden Marienbrück's bridge," he explains.
It's white. It's yellow. It's warm. It's intense.
"My dear stone."
The road crosss the forest.
Please note a sum: Red Arenisca, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Beautiful cross."
In the past, the Mamies belonged to the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
For all parts of the snow, stones and history, amber of the chief police of Stuttgart, red granite of the Church of Sankt Blasien, roof of Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweetness.
When Rongen thinks about how he dug the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a road, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
It's not rich. It's absolutely rich.
But today 14 people said to make the stone treatmentr, as well as cantors, a sculptor, a hero, a glass and a gardener have been installed up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man responsible for using the rest.
He'll have to go to Colonia in a while.
There are also stones to be saved.
Fighting talent around great potential
It's an active influence in the buffet.
16 students are wrapped around pancakes, tomatoes soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
In the same way, many companies, such as VW, are meeting in a body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: to hire students with more university talent before they enter the labour market and be hired by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of their students, they try to address exceptional talents in practical projects and to understand them.
The second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the Consortium is awarded to the talents.
A lady from the staff department shares bibliographies, gomitas and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to young talented illusions the program of practice and work for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
You see advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with industry and get experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe more closely the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not very common.
The news is that students want to be so direct.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects," says Selle.
The struggle for the fresh graduates is becoming more difficult.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If they don't have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly qualified work hand.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German stamps), there were 40,000 vacancies in October.
And according to VDI's forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and consultancy company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the talent hunt.
It organises cost-effective recruitment events such as the KPMG race, a modern type of yuncan, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's branches and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of selection at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly trying to choose and clean up the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the road we want to highlight the mass."
"The only way for him was if we were short."
For the Catalytic Dykta notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to direct approach to the campus, they are also hunting, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work holidays.
"We're trying to get students in the specialties."
"Something about Intersular", says Sitha Stübe, responsible for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company's website there are 35 vacancies.
"It's very difficult to fill the vacancies."
"This is a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld works with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that we can practice with us or perform their thesis.
There are no direct publicity campaigns for solar specialists.
Therefore, the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, long-term hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large corporation can't normally offer it," Stevee said, the staff member.
In the search for employment, money is no longer the most important thing.
The critical factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good climb possibilities.
According to a study from the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld hosts 55 of Germany's 100 best employees.
The Institute develops an annual list of best German employment providers.
For his question to the employer I am satisfied that he is working with the same environment and observes the previous conditions of employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his classification by his aspirators to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly placed in the external classifications of an employer's potential", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employee Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy to win a good reputation as employees.
Advise your customers more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the corner of the sector it is called Internal Employee Branding, also promoting corporate identity within its own template.
"Some satisfied employees are the best embassies."
When people are treated well and identify it with the company, then promotion is made directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a pandilla game," says Kriegler.
Obama holds new oil drills
From the coast of the United States of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drill has appeared in these years.
The Government of Washington issued a significant ban and thereby canceled its previous plans in an unprovoked manner.
New perforations seen by the moment also remain on the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What has caused this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Petroleum Platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that cost 11 workers and caused the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had allowed new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The participants wanted to reduce the U.S. dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not become clear who is responsible for the incompatibility of the Black Sea in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British Energy Consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A research committee responsible for Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the interior, lifted the moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different peter associations submitted applications for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to dispose of a new disaster using more difficult controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption charges, has fallen into debt, is reforming root.
Obama announced in parallel that the lucrative fiscal chains will be closed for oil and gas consortiums.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction of golf will be less thanks to a more strict regulation, up to date.
"The government plans are the most fragile for the growth of oil and gas industries," says the results of the current survey carried out by the BDO consultancy company - prior to the prohibition of mercury extraction.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are being postponed rapidly, in the face of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil brown, oil as a gasliner: millions of litres of raw water have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live in slavery, corruption and illegal oil trade.
In Celestine Akpobari it looks good.
"Don't give up," the environmental activist comforts journalists: "Today there will be enough oil in your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been able to take pictures of children walking in the water to the breast with the brightness of the light reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glass of water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It's not seen that on the surface there are brown oil stains.
Before I took my shoes here, she explained Esther Badom on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the river waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was turned into the wet wet tuber.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most remote regions in the world.
On the way to the river passage through the gap, widespread discouragement becomes apparent.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the ship removes a hot brown, which drops its hand into the water, it will extract some oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees are raised from the ground as dark branches of gifts, unfortunately they isolate the palms that shock and shake their palms.
In vain, birds are looking for bands of birds, as if they were in the wet as always: As the outer barrier closes, there is a kind of fantastic calm of a previous paradise with gas liner oil.
"What's going on here is an ecological struggle," says, uh, Celestine Akpobari. "We've been in constant danger of health."
The belica comparison is in progress.
The area of the ogoni settlement is a collective battle field over the years: here the first European explorers disappeared more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place their first factory the Shell Consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Today, companies are still banned from returning to Ogoniland: While they bombed more than two million black gold barrels daily throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of tubes, the oilfields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each two hundred meters above steel platforms such as water sculptures: "Navage trees" called charity to the heads of the drillers.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have a total corrosion.
At every moment a head failure, Akpobari thinks, then carries a constant flow of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been converted into the delta ecosystem for 50 years: one year after another, the amount of oil enterprising, as in the average of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Anyone responsible for the long-term environmental region will face this challenge.
While Shell's Consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution, ecologists come to their heads to break up and to tubes with refugees such as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low standards of safety generally in the world to conventionals, scientist Richard Steiner appealed to the consortium in 2008: Only the tuberculosis deficits are "on a multiple rather than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a tank full of oil under the free sky, figures emerge from among the missing: they are drowned and covered with oil.
One of the many neighborhoods, which are sometimes connected to the perforations, sometimes arbitraryly scattered over the ground, fires a fire: a small criminal offence.
In the barrel, oil is hot in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First of all, the gasoline enters through the tubes in the container, later the piper of caste oil and finally leaves diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel: "We bring 34,000 naira", about $22.
The residents of the delta enjoy the lack of fuel in one of the largest oil spills in black Africa.
Nigeria only has one refinance.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel only 40 euro per cent litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers' los", which called the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a significant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly wrong: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military duties, keep the best part in Aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers it purely academic to discuss whether environmental disasters are due better to the management of the population or to the flow of production.
"If oilmen did not act as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, or illegal refining."
While the conditions of the ogoni are devastated above all by Shell to the point where only a deduction of the Consortium appears: "It is better to present another nationality like China."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," said the ömann muscle.
" soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army takes illegal retinators, it does not threaten them by arresting them, or by a painful defeat.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This condemned invention has completely taken place in our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous manufacturing defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, researchers found a possible fault of the factory, which could produce "a catastrophic error in the engine".
The Qantas airport wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The airbus passengers who carried out an emergency landing at the beginning of November had much more luck than they could imagine: Australia's air security authorities realized through their investigations a major safety problem in some A380 engines, and warned of a possible industrial defect.
The potential defect has a complex impact: In a manguit connection, fatigue or screams can be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic error in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce with 20 A380 planes.
Among those found in the Qantas-Airbus was to carry out a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a request in the Sydney Federal Court that would allow more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline would claim compensation for the incident of early November.
In the engine brand they have lost pieces and their tail is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be reimbursed.
Australian researchers announced that they would carry out more safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, a spokesman for ATSB.
The issue of security has become sufficiently important as to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline maintained its A380 fleet on land for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained about three of its A380 on land temporarily.
Lufthansa rejected the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered aircraft is the world's largest passenger plane.
A Nevada throughout the country causes chaos in traffic
Germany is completely white: From one day to another it has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets the chaos reigns, the trains and the planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
In winter Germany: Nearly all the country reached warm temperatures during the night of the Thursday, which has triggered the chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited in most buses and in many streets.
At the A7 at the time of Flensburg, the whales are in continuous operation, removing the new snow once and for all, but are not prepared.
In addition, strong wind strikes the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects living seas with water level 1.2 metres above its normal level on the coast of the Schleswig-Holsteins Baltic Sea.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on the roads and on national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partly 30 centimetres of recent snow falling and cold winds and strong winds are responsible for removing it.
There were lots of trucks and cars caught during the night.
In Sajonia Anhalt, police authorities also reported major street riots.
In A2, snow and wind paralleled traffic and created attics.
In Turingia the Nevadas affected A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the roads or the destroyed chain and the caves are the main problems.
In Sajonia the Interurban Service of Leipzig is suspended in Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Turingia had an ICE train to stop her trip to Munich.
Bombs and rescue service provided 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink.
Winds with snow are breaking down the streets.
At the largest German airport, the snow wind caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman from the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesman, there are 40 cancelled flights.
The whales are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers trapped in the airport, yet there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck broke into a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The machine suffered mild wounds.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was delayed.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's drive to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason by morning.
He also lost a 30-year-old woman, after giving a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a rebalancing road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be more milder and dust-like and therefore it will be remedied in soft grass.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to make much cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Diosche Bank is looking for a buyer for its yellow towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutschen Bank settled its headquarters: Gammel Towers were modernized in Frankfurt's bank neighborhood; while the bankers returned to their former place of work.
But now the financial consortium appears to want to profit from the costs of re-enactment, and seeks a buyer for both of them, as the Financial Times Deutschland says, based on a vote.
The poll does not specify the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether we should have the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
Therefore, Germany’s largest credit institution re-examines its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the Gamel Towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some EUR 200 million figures.
A sale would assume a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area estimate the value of the periodical towers named "Greentowers" in around EUR 500 million.
If the refurbishment buildings in a bank fund or an independent investor have not been revealed at the moment, he said he would.
Thousands of people fighting for failed mines
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about buried mines, which were dropped after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies could not be found, as security measures were still cautious in place of disaster.
About two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were buried in the mine.
A search was introduced in place of disaster, but no sign of survival was found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to land for safety reasons.
After the second intensive detonation, authorities and experts claimed that there were no possibilities for miners to survive.
The bodies have not been recovered until the date.
Family and friends are currently reminded of the victims of a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent sunlight in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
Keep quiet for two minutes.
In tribute to buried mines, 29 tables were placed with mines, lamps and mine names.
There were also personal photos and objects, under suit and surfboards.
The flags went half past the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected miners to return to the area "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the head of the Dutch government, to the participants in the Memorial Act.
"But they never returned home."
He can't assume his son's death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the President of the Government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial.
At the first explosion on 19 November, mines of British and South Africa were also buried.
Rescue workers began firing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to decline, Gary Knowles, chief of police, told journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gorilla fit in the artistic movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Reffn once again explores the boundaries of the gender with his "Wallalla Rising" battle epic.
In what public will Danish director Nicolas Winding Reffn think about turning "Wallalla Rising"?
A young Viking warrior imprisoned with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost over-human struggles, an ideal sound for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and launch his enemies the tricks of his body with life when it's bad humor.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is called in fact, does not say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters are allowed to carry for as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they close and enjoy the beautiful and terrible mountains of Scotland, which the fishermen offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
More ideal for grown and interested cinematists in existenceism and in very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a punishment that cannot be detached from one another.
Director Winding Reffn considers his savages and trilogy on the trajectory of drug abuse "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he strongly refuses to make his works for all the public with something more humor in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic home.
A brain mass and a bunch of triples can't convince most of the artists.
Most of the fans of the action die in frustration, if Unijo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a host of violent Christian missionaries for interpretative reasons and is stuck forever in peace and snow before his team arrives in America and returns there.
It is a mustache that "Wallalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and only publishes on DVD.
It's a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the crunching and bleeding made, a piece of film is sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or logical action, it's all atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Reffn is confined only to a moment of relaxation and its smooth images and the loud sound band of transit make him a nude in his throat, above all, the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only a small young ruby, who loyally supports the One, preserves something as innocent, all others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes a war out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only those who are lost in all ways.
"Wahalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to anger, change and surprise.
An experience.
Dark's move
The OIEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to think on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 combat aircraft attacked a mysterious Cuban building in Syria.
It is located on the edge of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), dealing with a reactor that the Syrians seemed to have built with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley outside the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the very appropriate nearby El-Kibar for the production of plutonium, which builds nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique serves only for purposes other than those of the 50s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with dirty satellite images.
They showed a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
Not long ago the reactor was in operation, he says, but he was still not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is only more known that since then, the enigmas have been made bigger with time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built an reactor in El-Kibar, but that he had only seen indications that there would be "a nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be more cautious and only talk about a "supposing reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "pleasible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the OIEA.
When he was asked about the assurance that he had before a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied in a paper-based way in the summer that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly broke down from the shoulders of the alleged "unusable military building" and shook the ground to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an OIEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in El-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images on a Member State, from commercial vendors right after the attack, which should have a higher information value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always understood that it had never had a secret nuclear programme nor built any reactor.
The uranium was derived from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The OIEA rejected it as inverse after analysis of particles.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss this matter, just as with satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from having a second inspection in El-Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a tight silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not been successful since June 2008 and "progressed into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a Western High-level diplomat in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons is at last seen by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which should be "functional" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
Inspectors have not given public knowledge until what teams they are dealing with, what functions they have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated Marj as a-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah as an inner home of the nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located on or immediately alongside a military base, Syria therefore prohibits access to the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the U.S. has requested the IAEA to spy out military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to teams thanks to United States Secretary of State's warnings.
Through satellite photos, the IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube on the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high position in Vienna said that at least one of the teams could be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities" or of uranium or reconnaissance wealth; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where later the plutonium should be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best case, pluciable assumptions.
There is no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are located in the three places.
As hundreds of underground trucks have disappeared, no one has any information on where the bombs remain.
The OIAE considers that the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other part of the Eufrates, is unlikely to be recognized by the Syrians in 1998 as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But photos from orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements in the three alleged suspect locations and eliminated large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It can be a case but only helps to train the suspect.
Furthermore, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has been using a few months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians will allow, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago calmed down that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, since a few months ago, Glyn Davies, a kind of US ambassador, is threatening the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most severe means the United States nuclear authorities have to set up controls.
Yukiya Amano, director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but still empty.
This path is very risky: most of the IAEA governance council is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious about a scale.
On the other hand, as one diplomat thought, "And what happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love in Wartime
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began this summer with the direction of her debut without a name.
She herself wrote the script, a history of love between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
We do not know much more about this, but this is enough for the agitation.
The noise is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, loves her Serbian rapist during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested rapidly, with which they have recently moved some scheduled days of riding in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested an interview with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the Ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Not diplomatic, weeks ago, women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no stories of love in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position in relation to the victims is sufficient on the guide.
Its organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be replaced as Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave it after a shot and applied a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not quite clear why Jolie wasn't in spite of everything.
The young author repeats that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, puts himself in great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and vote for all the parties involved.
Its contents remain intact.
In the network a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and they came back to meet when she, a Muslim Bosnian, was deported to a Serbian field where he worked as a guard.
What sounds very different is the variant "the victim of rape is loved by torturer".
It's safe that Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unjust and based on incorrect information".
You can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the guide continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like away from here.
This evening at last will be good for the Irish.
No trace of pain
Instead, the household team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cry out with joy as they turn up high music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club lives in the Southern Cork, because players launch, and find, ping pingballs to beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros more than a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type, this amazing drink game and the computer intelligence actually don't do good things.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with it, to be distracted by the confusing question, what will happen to him in the future.
The entertainment in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January it will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presentation," he says.
"It's very far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her brother Colin is currently working as TI consultant in London.
Young people go: There are many families on the island like Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predicting economic experts and the Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
Up to 2015 there are 200,000 immigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migration wave is comparable to what the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress which has brought great prosperity to the Irish, melancholy is currently being extended.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing for young, well-trained Irish people, for whom it is so far up.
Loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under thirty years of age are in the par.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director on the table of young immigrants, who are crying out, "In Ireland everything goes down."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers, but who can, go and lose our country and with it to a whole generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, will appear in the future because the government is only dedicated to mountains and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages but do not have strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Note how your partners are involved in practices that are not reminiscent of the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressed."
People like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingA BroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the subject of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to drive your career," says the manager.
On its website are photos of a boy practicing surf in Australia and another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, if it does not bring freedom and fun.
Half a year ago, Seán O'Donovan knows how to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish fellows on construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January it goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, since it was a long time ago when he broke the threshold of his house.
"Money money in Germany for a home in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs at something embarrassing and goes for iced rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked in the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for EUR 380,000, 100 per cent funded by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," she says.
Do you have any fear of failure with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, serves more heat and says, "I don't have kids who have to eat and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he's often heard right now.
"No one should be hungry, our situation is not, with many differences, as dramatic as in past times here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with it we feel as Irish for the first time."
He laughs and counts on his father, who, in the last great economic crisis, went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like on the other side.
He's been working in London for a couple of years, and why didn't he go well with him and his bride in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that concerns you about the way it is: the celebration of its 27 birthdays this Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid you can be born at a holiday party.
"Only, not too much emotion," she says and gives a great treat to her brain.
"I'm sorry, it sounds very sad."
"We better call her a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in most parts of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the investigation has been conducted regularly since 1995, it is possible to follow up on the change of attitudes in the region.
In the results of this year's survey, held in September and in early October, two related issues are highlighted.
The first is relatively encouraging humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a 40 per cent reduction in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America had a serious impact on support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries have only been affected by a short recession and enjoyed strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in conditions of poverty increased marginally in 2009 and that it has again decreased to 32 per cent this year.)
However, the state of mind varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and has increased violent crimes.
A second time since the beginning of the investigations, the most investigated in Latin America have mentioned crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see figure 5).
Some 31 per cent claim that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent of the previous year and is the lowest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while only 56 per cent were in 2007 (see figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62 per cent of the respondents in Venezuela view the same (and 80 per cent support private companies), although its left-wing President, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that has more leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of the respondents (before 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (after 9 per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (between 9 per cent and 11 per cent last year).
However, the United States is the most influential country in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela maintains this title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.

No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they have gone far worse than the foreigners who are trying to help the country cope with its problems.
Votes were introduced in the Urnas, some people voted several times, papers taken in the canals, destroyed electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
The electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
A number of Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, traveled across the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them eventually gave themselves up for defeat.
A dozen candidates to the presidentials, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and asked for the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, United Nations senior officer in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have stated with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities are necessarily invalid.
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents, is committed to René Preval, the outgoing populist president, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
It is expected that the expiry will take place in January.
All hopes for elections have not yet been lost.
The two main candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Miranda Manigat, an old lady, have withdrawn their initial request for invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Celestin, who only has support, if he has anything, has gone through the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic strikes the country and more than a million Earth survivors are still living in shops, a great stay is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, necessary for voting, have not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot in the game.
Aid donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has become patented, the Haitians themselves think about it.
Stepping points towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity rate at 20 points, up to 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, which can turn him into a successful campaign for a second term of office in the elections of the coming year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this respect, the indications are not final.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to be responsible for economic policy even after his wife became president, was accustomed to developing budgets that undermined tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income on its discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernández's government lost most of her in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's fall because of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some disparate members of the Peronist movement have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after a caustic session in which a member handed over to each other in the face and other Members accused the government of bribery, the Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss it," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be implemented next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action than it should be spent.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to union wage requirements, are approximately 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was at the edge of the economic collapse, said that growth and poverty reduction were their priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector, and made INDIC, the statistical institute, adapt to official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now modernize these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentina's agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a significant decline in 2002.
Perhaps for that reason Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached agreement with the bond holders who had refused to be forced to restructure prior to the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the faith Governments grouped in the Paris Club, which is worth about $6,700 million.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve supervision of the IMF, as is often customary.
However, last month, Amado Boudoudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the purity of INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wishes to remain in politics when he has completed his mandate, bearing in mind that he no longer has his husband on his side.
If you do, you will need to gain the support of the middle class, most of which has been weakened by Kirchnerism.
When Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have collapsed.
If you want to win other elections, you have to decide whether or not she calmly rejects many of her husband's policies.
Average hole for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother on the other side of the road?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the voters, agreed on 27 November to elect the mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a defender of the feelings of the continent, creating innovative business links, including a free partial trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but few.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) had finished winning three of the five elections to the mayor, it was not able to get most of the votes.
In its place, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been targeted by a total independence of Taiwan, almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of KMT.
If they had been presidential, Mr Ma would have been in trouble.
Since your election two years ago, the proportion of your party's votes has decreased by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD was affected by KMT in associations.
The elections were able to see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including stolen campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banners and light dance girls.
Nor was the mysterious attempt to kill a giant.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, was campaigning by one of KMT's candidates the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly at his face, shooting him and killing a transvestite.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to win the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, creating suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to incline to KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent was not addressed in itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence in fact and hates China's military threat.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
On his behalf, Mr Ma said he had confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to subject them to trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve Taiwan's return.
China did not waste any time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
No doubt you would like to achieve political integration as well, but first is the first.
The best is to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to take place.
In any case, the PPD has reinvested.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President, between 2000 and 2008, openly urged explicit independence.
However, under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is trying to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been warmly welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, like His Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled his mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the creation of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could be conducted without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatist, not to be presented to the presidentials.
Even without interrupting Mr. Chen, the PPD will have difficulties in choosing from among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also carry out an examination of conscience.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears mainly due to unemployment and growing disparities between rich and poor.
A spokesman for KMT says he will restructure his office as well as local teams.
The large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese think economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a famous colonist, "the point of no return has been crossed."
Appointments to the Grammys: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of Artist Revelation.
Act at the request of a president, and possibly people will stand on you.
Hope Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz singer chosen personally by President Obama to act at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level appointment in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an abbreviated figure of jazz since its 2008 album, " Hope", the appointment is what it thinks about, but it respects the rules of Grammys which must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums out of the market before writing what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was no doubt a big step forward and, given its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influence of pop, fun and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated on jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is Veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's techlist by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a well-known member of New Orleans and usual guest in "Treme", of the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is much more focused on fusion such as Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk gained merit in the category of large groups, competing against the large camera jazz of Billy Children Ensemble and the ever-hauling Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in its band.
Award Awards Grammy: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classical albums
The designations in the area of classical music for the 53rd edition of Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among those named with ties to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his synphony No 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and trained at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also named by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music nominations are distributed in three categories covering orchestra albums, opera, coral and solo.
The year's classic producer category includes five named: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Malinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Synphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra Orchestra Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by Verdi by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the names are Berg by "Lulu" of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Marinensky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers named a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt by Synphony No 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Appassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Grafiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt Synphonia No. 4 was held in the Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, for about 30 minutes, is located "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the old oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concert" is named by the instrumentistic soloist act with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for her to play in the Avi Avital dodola, which played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed in the orchestra function category to lead the Chicago Synphonic Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the so-called soloists are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and Archbishop Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The names as soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, Soprano Jesse Norman was named by his recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mix in Temecula receives approval from the management committee
The project for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local management commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it promotes terrorism and attacks.
However, the members of the committee decided Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local law and would be impressive from aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or pagans, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic centre of the Temecula valley, Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who intervened in favor or against the centre, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"This is another Seed Planet with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
Plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also caused protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, in New York, where attacks occurred on 11 September 2011.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imman Mahmoud Harmous has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families lived without problems in Riverside County, but he wanted more space than the warehouse he purchased in a shared property with a water-filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mix, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two miners and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparal Institute.
Opposers can still appeal to the municipal council.
A microbiosis resistant to arsenic creates the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life forms are possible without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"May grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it doesn't need to be a kind of life-form really 'alienigena'," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the Thursdays of Science publication.
Since then, there have been six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and oxygen.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the fossil by the arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else you can do," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for the search for life on different planets of the Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, knowing its aspect.
The study focuses on a discovered microbiosis in the Earth.
However, the call for a press wheel to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to stimulate their biochemicals and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider necessary for life may not be so stable," said Charles Cockell, the cathedral of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell didn't become part of the research team.
"This work is new because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not carried out on a case-by-case basis.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, which conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it presented high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorous are similar from a chemical point of view, so it is estimated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of the phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for different agencies to distinguish them."
"The arsenic is quite different, however, so that it doesn't work as well as the phosphorus, so it comes in and, in some way, appeals to biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbiosis grows better with phosphorous, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place suggests that there may naturally be a way of life that uses arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea of replacing the arsenic by the fossil is not new, but there has never been an example that proves it works.
The arsenic was the most common in the early years of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"I know that it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not only the way life was formed on Earth in the past," Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Found the stolen dogs missing in Compton
The two dogs that were missing from the four robbers in front of the Belllower motel were found, according to the officers of the sheriff of the Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Corgi Gales Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck at which they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs recovered the Wednesday afternoon and the two others found the Wednesday afternoon, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman from the Los Angeles county sheriff's department.
"The good news is that dogs are good," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They're back with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"It's carrying out an investigation."
"We don't mean anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following some tracks."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found, so they made some comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month dog) had not suffered harm.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis who Rickard and Peek claimed to be in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs would show them in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba championship, according to Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops in the nearly two months round which the couple is participating in canine competitions.
The moon by night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in on the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer creature, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis on the train because they had a very rough tire and would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van robbery on Tuesday morning at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
The Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roll again, when the MGM restructuring receives the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
The Thursday, a New York federal banknote judge officially approved the "prepared" plan by creditors to eliminate about $5,000 million debt, leading the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and external production of films and television programs.
The failure of the Thursdays confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. banking code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM to slow down under the Founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrated.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently crediting, which is contributing to $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. investment bank was hired to provide advice on the necessary management to manage its finances, while fighting to make payments of interest per 300 million dollars a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-President of Enron and an expert in the recovery of railway companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Dughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy more than 140 believers in the study took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company on sale by the end of 2009.
However, I attracted a few posters and no one was willing to pay for more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreement, was finally supported by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the bank in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million allowances for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's companies, which have been earning $375.000 per month for their company administration services, will receive a "winning" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production in MGM, which spent only one film this year, and gathered an annual pizza of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also planned to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study requires a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investigator Carl Icahn, who owned around 18% of MGM debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your budget balance for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful player this year, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant improvement in your budget for gifts.
Consider that because of the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bicycles of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or about 48 sides of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently I visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic games could buy at least $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; this year's technological game will probably have more power, at the same time and even less compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games with related websites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And the players driven by button piles are increasing, as well as the players with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are ball games of the size of a cube that sing a note when its bars open.
An aperture is equivalent to a note, and a second aperture begins to weapons a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start opening, you can't stop.
For the best option for two and a half years, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated mussel plays turn-change games like Simóm Dice, and can take the moon step, thanks to its innovative feet crafted with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the game used Mickey as a ballet instructor, although their parents complained about lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the '80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computered educational games.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a full set of questions card designed to turn a drive into a session with a current self-recording schedule.
If you are eager to give your child your smart phone, here will be three independent options.
MobiGo de VTech ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and most easy to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years old), it is the first place on the Leapster line, with a new and bright screen.
No version is compatible with old cards.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90, from 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-type system to present electronic games and books, and has a range of SD cards that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks only larger than a cell box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to store words by placing the blocks in line before the time is over; it is formidable for an improvised weapon of words.
There are increasingly players that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on your presence in toys, the two biggest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online mask at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years) which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two articles.
These could include pins on wheels or a massive Puffle game.
slightly larger than its toothbrush belt, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microbots driven by button piles.
The false insect quickly moves over 12 silicone pads that live in random directions.
It's fun to make a locker to see if you can find the exit.
It's durable too.
We were able to leave the kitchen table and even pass a mouse inside our dog's mouth.
Promotes a more moderate side of maintaining order in China
As an urban instructor Sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a square of the city, seriously inspecting the nerves at its task, issuing low voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the police officers of China's urban order, afraid and despised by their capricious energy measures and their tendency to violence, to convey some impression to a crowd of spectators.
"Finish!"
"Look out!"
Show them, he insisted, "How are the beautiful little ones!"
Four kids who just passed adolescence with white gloves and identical green olive jackets and custom pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly lined black shoes.
Four elegant shadows placed perfectly above the hair stretched with blue and white shades.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, unfortunately.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of the city inspectors in China.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree title.
GuangDong Province changed the grey green color of uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidation: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a truck truck of snacks, and observed it with the constantly frenzied dinner for half an hour, until the ambulance salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 660,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has collected 13 women from its urban police, specifically elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police touch a softer side, woman.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's continued respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to comply with city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed a transvestite after using their cell phone to film them while resolving a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, which described how to effectively kill criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai Sandwich salesman suffered brain damage after a queen with five officials.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese attacking street vendors.
"Chenguan has left a cicator in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication last year after another tactical dispute.
The newspaper demanded "a really methical cleaning."
Sceptics say the current approach is very far from this.
After the district asked for an announcement by eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a stage entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both things.
The district notice required female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above the average, above 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
The retirement is compulsory at the age of 26.
The officials said that the work was physically excessive for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," said an anonymous district official to Rednet.com, a government-owned website.
"First, the external qualities of candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperature "and the inner qualities".
Women's language is like flowers, he said, and he added, "In addition to being flowers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the city administration office of the district, is not concerned about supporting this description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese working warnings for both sexes.
Then comes the need for harmonious facial features.
If this means being careful, it is a matter of debate among Chinese people.
Of course, the minor or described should not be presented.
"We can't let a cook or a thief come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful beads and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her face is sexy, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate, Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the city's image".
They also did not oppose their work for a certain time, they said, because they open up bigger career ambitions than simply settle salesmen in the streets where they are supposed to go around their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces more or less than a dozen ambulance vendors which launch on foot or on bicycle, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu bags as possible before being fired.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Miss Xu while a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily leaving his car pulled by bicycle with fiddles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than abusers.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studied marketing at his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that women's officials lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the seller's market.
They can only threaten by accusing the offenders of their supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the recent public demonstrations of enthusiasm against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were encouraged after the false rumor that some Chengguan officials had killed a seller was spread out.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night-time episode; 14 government vehicles were turned or caught in fire.
For the moment, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But peace is only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the famous Plaza Baoguang, where female officials patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the furnace instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed bitterly.
The situation was halted for 15 minutes before officers, with a bad face, opened their doors to their vehicles and were quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Juedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male team, remained behind, with his white badge given back to hide his name.
Like female officials, coordinators, men 40 years of age or older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight orally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"Most of the time is the public which starts the war."
Taxes will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that the Department of Justice's prosecutors had apologized to Senator John Ensign for the criminal prosecutions that had emerged from his business with an ex-computer and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most legal threat faced by Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered to be a potential presidential candidate for the Republican for 2012, until the scandal on his business had national owners last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said that it felt "certainly satisfied" by the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue".
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have been confused to violate a federal criminal ban on lobby.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative job through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's business with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work with Mr. Hampton and solicited on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law to make lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, which were close friends before the case, appeared inconsistencies with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict that former state employees use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of revolutioning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending government-explored clients.
While officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said that the Department seemed cautious about accepting political proceedings after several important revisions to its section of public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the midst of charges for misconduct.
The federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the following day, saying that the department did not want to raise charges against its client.
The Ensign defence team had been working with the prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office repeated in a Wednesday statement, " Acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable entering my details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which states that a payment of $96.000 from Ensign's parents to Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was no more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had been supporting the senator for a long time, which got work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign gave to Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of office, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "maching" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in question.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to make lobby.
When the news of the case first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position as the fourth President of the Republican in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that he planned to post a third mandate in the Senate.
When Ensign's voice, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and finalize its investigation.
" Senator Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in court rooms.
One minute, they sent reports of the shocking witness via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says, there were more than 150,000 Twitter messages on the process that dealt with the rape and children caught in their beds in a house that had been taken by fire.
The Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the sentence of the death penalty passed by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have presented written statements in the court detailing the arguments of appeals that would probably be dealt with by the courts for years.
One of the most protracted reports on the process, including the wide use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a circular atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate satisfactory satisfactorily made public passions exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeals judges to argue with the question whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
"As I have experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the court room is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defence lawyer of Mr. Hayes.
The first court judge, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of State, rejected the claims in a case last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that the coverage of serious cases may raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic case in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the sentence of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for his wife's murder, in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime was believed to have been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that had examined Mr. Hayes' conviction later in the middle of the century might be concerned by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courts' chambers, something inconceivable in the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said to have been arbitraryly imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might feel confused by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make the courts more fair.
The issue of Twitter is only one of many issues addressed by Hayes lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been injured when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members, showing them reflective photos of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some jury said they were shocked by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela of 11.
The defence attorneys say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and support that the judge wrongly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict by his foreign decision to order the jury to proceed for a weekend.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the impact of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a requisition to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media continued to flickle in the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily agglomerations of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "it was something I've never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all states."
Your attention to the cover of Twitter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news were more important than the reports submitted earlier were a playful vision that would make court policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments on adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are under pressure from that complaint.
In its letter, they referred to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's sentence due to the cover of the trial, and made it clear that they would require that the new means would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the twenty-first century."
Can civilization have a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by investment and negativity, this week some civilisation has emerged in Washington.
Is it a prize of genuine future bipartidist cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the fighting party in capital?
The March meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not lead to any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a short discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being an empty episode to win party points.
The presidential deficit committee's public meeting was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of one month has generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological breakdown that still separates members.
That is just enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both parties are in a test period, seeking each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations by participants were conducted with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very profound as to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed for the last two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health assistance or social assistance, both parties are located on opposite sides.
In any case, November's election has calmed the mood in Washington, at least for a short time.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration officer now at the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections trigger party passions, which then expand.
That's good."
In some matters, particularly those contained in the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no other option than to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, refusing unemployment subsidies for unemployed workers.
Following the March meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible treatment of these issues during the upcoming session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartidism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
"After things have to be done, psychology will soon reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilization can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012,," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed to their creation.
More aware that the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of overstepping their position, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut the costs of the state and cancel the new health law.
These early lines are already clearly noted in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Committee on Disability, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase in certain taxes and age of retirement, and the cut of costs.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have introduced the issue of the deficit in the order of the public day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting to reach that number.
The greatest resistance is among the chosen staff in the panel, suggesting that there are at least at least few grounds or wish for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the wars between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of party shocks when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance and then for a period of more bipartite cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the current election party, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will observe closely the reaction of people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and find a compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partnership and polarization are now more than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress than was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at his time.
At the same time, both parties' activists see 2010 as the prelude to a more transcendent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization that shows this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points in the issues that still divide them.
A filter US document depicts Moscow as a paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy" and leaves a part of the bribes and protection money delivered directly to Kremlin, according to the U.S. Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service manage huge cantage systems, which helped explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They spend money not only on legitimate business but also on organized criminal groups.
Each strata of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has named the "vertical authority", takes part as the money goes up the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his website Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and he blames it for much of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several requests for release on such charges.
In September, when he was asked on a Russian television channel about a document that would suggest he was corrupt, he said, "It's a joke, a patronage, a massacre."
According to surveys, the Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the embassy report, and it is not unusual to be the diplomats of a foreign country who do so.
"The direct slaverys of the government of the city of Moscow with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional' and to claim that the government works more than a cleptocracy as a government," the note states.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means 'close' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the tax office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and the military are at second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system where criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that SFS earns the money of the largest companies, and that the police focus on small businesses.
One source stated that the report "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understood that it was best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they had not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also that they were protected by law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while money-laundering is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by one or the other.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has acknowledged that he has made little progress.
The note from the packaged report on men taking mallets, probably full of cash in fact, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of the Indian expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without power separation, he said that corruption is inevitable.
At national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia over $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in item 154 (the countries are classified as at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the United States Ambassador's note, which did not take place until late at night during Moscow's time, will certainly cause disturbance within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents might be false and reacted angrily by a revelation that said US diplomats called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such pride, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres are obliged to face the past
In a weakly lit hall, with broken and collapsed walls, the director of the Along Veng Secondary School reminded the man that he had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here's Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander continues to be popular at this former strength of the Red Jemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres return to the government, the long-standing loyalty is being finally challenged in Andong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled him to deal with the victims publicly with those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school text book that first taught him the history of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia Joint Court issued the first sentence of an ex-member of the Red Jemeres, condemning the former chief of the known torture centre Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, compounding their efforts for reconciliation and their efforts to reintegrate the Cambodian society.
"There is feeling and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"To them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Paul Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgent that lasted until the last movement that took place in December 1998.
As Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of war from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Andong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of red Yemeni fighters began to travel to the government, culminating in the achievements of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was arrested by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their beneficiaries, the oldest combatants of the Red Jemeres fell into absolute poverty common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although few elite officials of the Red Jemeres maintained their local administrative positions in exchange for their weapons, the racial soldiers continued to be poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have benefited little after the performance," Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation said, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the Utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of making business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeries when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before he dedicated himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Reds was good," he said.
"Tak Mok told him to eat everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to get used to it."
The current court of the Red Jemeres has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, it is expected that the court will begin proceedings with Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thiirith, another former German minister.
The court's mandate is to process major leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This didn't work much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has been focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma arrest, a project in which thousands of forced workers were thought to have died.
During a recent baroque afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a land road in the suburbs of Anlong Veng.
When the sun dropped long shadows on the fresh past, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She said that if the court called, she wouldn't be present.
"Camboya is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more processes, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who visited the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia has to do to advance, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to gather these broken pieces so we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Along Veng Secondary School, said that the new text book helped students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents reacted with scepticism when she took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book of text and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of persons to be prosecuted by the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
In any case, here the Red Jemeres preserve a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many rotten grasses and covered with desired plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hole covered by an oxidated roof of hojalat.
The body of Paul Pot was burned here on a number of neumattics after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile salesman on the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray for him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's performances, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Paul Pot's last vacation, where he would leave a hand of mature platinum with the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its arms-qualified uranium reserve
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced the Wednesdays that will give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. Government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have come to an unprecedented point last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations with Belarus were carried out in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for armament of a Belarus research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations' Nuclear Security Summit, chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was seen that it was a good success to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in Prague in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to break free from all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundred kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for arms) and the low enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our first material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials stated that the first task of withdrawing Belarus's uranium was particularly difficult in October, since the material had been slightly irradiated.
The officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was completed on a plane.
The U.S. Government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of research with low-rich uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy staff working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "it was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will attempt to remove its reservation until 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko on human rights.
But the Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "As progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is still a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not respond to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not respond to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda prisoners directed to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, according to a telegram by the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is how Wikileaks's (cables) filter documents are reflected in the newspaper The country, which adds that the first vice-president of the Government, Maria Teresa Fernández of Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed of "can demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President recognized that the Council's report "had taken the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From the Vega he stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "prevented pills," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The then owner of Foreigners, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this issue the lowest profile possible, although the Government had a limited influence capacity at the hands of the judges".
On its behalf, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the court's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal element or sensitive information," explained the Ambassador after he spoke to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", more than about the information disclassified by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will make our efforts to manage the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, in a lunch between the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are very zealous for their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his colleagues "to avoid comments of rhetorical inflation, in an attempt to reduce the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the implementation of the PP in this matter.
"In spite of its general American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalise on any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the Government of the US," she says.
The mixed confession complained on the "agobio" network of being a mother
The young man was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Trembling at the galley"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used since childhood, he communicated with a prima and at least a friend; the two natural people of Noia, the Korean people of which she is from.
Messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their emotional life, which ABC rebuilds through testimony from its family members.
The 30-year-old Gallegi started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrial.
They spent a year.
When they left it, soon it was assumed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him do DNA test.
It wasn't too late to meet another bride.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousama, a neighboring town.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that its romance broke down, which broke down.
In March 2008, she's in Menorca, alone, and she writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquet because I've come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, he now takes into account what is with the child all day and does not have freedom to do what he wants."
Then it's about a message to the mobile that just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the cry with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she says.
In May, he told his people: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only gonna be until the 19th, because I have to present a job to keep it from losing."
Of course, if everything's okay with him, he's taking his cousin.
"He will be with whom he ought, or with me, and he will never happen to me in life again with anyone who is not my mother," a suspicious intention given to him by his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When he writes it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was reportedly killed on the 10th is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On one side you're with me and you like the place a little bit, but on the other side you're going to class almost every day."
It's about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll be there (the child) for a few summers, and I'll be saving a bit of bread from the cane."
On 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very great kiss of Caesar, which asks me when you come."
"He says that Alberto sent you no video on the e-mail, see how when he wants to find me, he's got to go."
On the 30th, "The kid's fine, he's going to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
There are messages on the Internet in blogs dedicated to the anime and the hand.
He even had one himself in the MySpace universe, now interviewed, where he was called "Muki the Prisoner."
"Trembling at the galley (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, keeping his mouth shut, declares his weight to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think everything's happened because he didn't tell him that he was a single mother.
Monica went into Palma's provincial prison yesterday from the city centre of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "we didn't intend to cause any harm to the minor."
Previously, he admitted that he had drowned Caesar in the bath and buried his dead in a coffin.
The defense and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 scenes at Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and votes experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already seen in general as, whether or not, the prospects are more positive than they are, since the number of votes this training takes on these commissions often double what it receives in Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan populace received 610,473 votes in 2008 in general, while the figure rose to 316,222 in 2006 respectively.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
To maintain this trend at the top, which has been fed by a transmission of the PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections are held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs at the Congress, while CiU would also win four (now having 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 MPs (having 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, ERC would lose a Member - now has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
However, in order to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the populace can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and its relevance to the Barcelona Diplomatic Office, one of the administrations that is budgeted in May - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Nationalists and popularists agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose its memberships in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, CRC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this training to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistorio - 5 per cent of the votes - .
The PP has increased its voting number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can promote the return to the Taraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ross, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were found on several occasions.
The population has also grown in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and hopes to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell made thousands of passports available to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a Yihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taibai" (Let), the last of Bombay attacks that resulted in the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, until it is possible to ensure that with "The Kampai Operation" the Al Qaida falsification device has been "deployed" at international level and "so its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, the cell has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they have been falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so their "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with full impunity.
The destabilised cell is not the only one that the Yihadist network had operating in Europe, since research has participated in, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not clear that in EU territory it is being carried out in the next few days similar to its development on the night of last March in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arsad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were arrested in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muslims Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kybumbamrung.
These were those who directed from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - stole mainly from tourists passports who meet the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, documents should be in the name of varons between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed faces.
According to the investigation, no data has been found currently related to the arrests in Catalunia with Bombay's attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taibai", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was carried out, from Catalonia it was sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the "command" team that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police have been inundated with extensive documentation.
The PP requires More to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to present to Arthur personally his terms and conditions to support his investment as President of Generalitat, identical to those already planted during the campaign and who are summarily giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to advance from philo- sovereignist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to plant in the Ecuador of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples attended the meeting of Artur More with the assurance that he had obtained 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to do so, as the candidate for CIU needs at least one of the trainings that will take the opposition away from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain at Congress when general elections are held, but at the moment, the talks that these days continue, but with the rest of the political leaders, are held in Catalan.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereign and independent speeches must be planted", as well as the economic concert - similar to the Basque country - which the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have common ground for extending the political apparatus of a very inflexible autonomous administration and for eliminating the tax on events and donations.
Details of Mas investment negotiations will be taken up by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a strong opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and will do so today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Catalana Solidarity).
The guerrilla claimed that the deaths were not due to "a lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot don't waste that their cell phone killed more than 11 years old
The officials of the guerrilla La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press tour yesterday to highlight the damage that had caused the institution's criminal conduct by Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least 11 elders who were responsible for it.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, compared with the centre's letter, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" of the dead but "the legitimacy and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil servants".
And it is that in addition to the social dispersion that can suffer the entity because of not having observed the criminal activities of the cellist, the great threat to La Caritat now covers the form of substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime is withdrawn in August 2009 and that since then it has not ceased to kill.
The judge had already pointed to the car which ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of geriatrics - who suspected that in many cases no doctor had personally explored the missing but that, dealing with the age and pathology of the patients, the transmission was eliminated by telephone.
Caritat, through her director, rejected this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action by any other person who is not himself imputed".
The already baptized "Angel de la Death" confessed 11 murders earlier and explained that the first crime committed him on 29 August 2009 for, a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case, death caused him a overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime he committed by helping him with a mixture of sedentary pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that central staff have access to medicines.
Insulin pinches and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her absence to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being carried out in the laboratory that must clarify whether Villa did not lie down and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she took them inside by giving them leave as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who died between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, it does not give credibility to the events of the cellist, nor even to the number of convicted killings, which do not go any further, and justify its attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in her visits to the judge and in the little sense that it has to change its way of proceeding after she has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is at risk
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of Trichet yesterday that warned "markets should not underestimate our response capacity".
Peripheral differences have been strong and the actions of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has only reported what is a disturbing sign.
What has been produced yesterday is itself from an unfair market which is equally displacing but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be withdrawn for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan by ineffectiveness and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures over time and leaving only limited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the quarterly deficit with limited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase programme, even in the sign of intensifying it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will return to the excellent response of the markets yesterday and if they are still meant to withdraw liquidity measures, which God is with us!
As at its May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of benefits and closed the markets, tomorrow could repeat the story.
The ECB must be credible and consistent.
In May he announced that the moon and Wednesday he had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday's letter substation in Portugal has been very poor.
The treasure alone issued 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous substation.
Still, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change of market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland are made public.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million short-term and other 15,000 potentials and are up to February for private capital or will be nationalized.
While Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to gain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we all are playing the same game.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy smile.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers would approve tomorrow.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatization, measures to react to employment sound to investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bolsa has risen by 4.5%, the double that of the rest of European Bolsa.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and satisfactorily and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a sub-key of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope it will be resolved with a strong demand and help to teach doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Aid Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasure has over 40,000 million liquids available on the triple that we bought in March and closes your access to the markets without a day.
However, the strategy must continue to be the woman of Caesar, "in addition to being it, to think of it".
All right, let's go.
The President of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicily meeting requested by his children
The time is not tomorrow in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will object, when he considers it "full-right no", the next day's Supreme Court of El Enebro, on 16th day, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to evaluate most of them and make contact with the management bodies of the titled office of Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and Mary Joseph are finalizing the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute by the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company does not seem willing to resign in his dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Of its board of directors, five of its seven children were dismissed as administrators at the shareholders' assembly of 18 January this year and whose prosecution is recorded in the Mercantil Register.
El Enebro's court meeting for the next 16th day, convened by the Judge of the Madrid Mercantil No. 2, has reopened the case of the Turks within the family of Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge to establish the Assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Martha and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as "a desperate resource of the applicants for their five children for, through procedural argument, a clear violation of the Law and abuse of the law, trying to validate and heal the radically nullity of 18 January," according to their official prosecutors.
This argument will be the basis for its argument once the meeting is held, when it is considered to be "no full right".
The same protagonists, who kept a discreet silence, had failed to call a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the property and owner company of Bodegas Vega Sicily, among other assets, seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims that 51 per cent of the capital is used in accordance with the family protocols.
This is the subject of a fundamental issue which the judge must decide once the view on the application for compensation is held, for which no date has yet been stated.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull collapsed in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selection of speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a recent ski resort and, despite the rising trajectory of the last moments, last November, in the final right of the championship all stood by the triunfo of the Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without demeaning the ability as a pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the ability of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very distant purposes from high auto-mobile competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design chain assembly of manufacturing factories around the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The objective is to play, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding mistakes and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factor has enabled Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that occur during the careers and trials.
Russwurm explained that in 1992 the escorts had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team is currently working with 180 high-quality professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design all the changes in the balls.
Siemens's directive explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull balls with the exception of the engine, which is of the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can take place from the simulator's virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech high-tech self-keys.
As the only limitation of this technological improvement gap is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible on each time to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its balls in a location about 50 kilometers from London.
It is two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this commission is up to 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the latest Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has been put to the service of its participation in the circuits are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their zero notoriety.
The factory's tech chief, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that I+D's advances in road cars brought 50% of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology is 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "they are indispensable gladiators".
HP will install in two 20 years own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive collaboration shop in Barcelona yesterday is his partner Ponti Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres, which the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set an example of the remodeled shop located in the Great Barcelona Way, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being the third one from Barcelona.
Herero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The HP head of personal systems has also ensured that the philosophy to install stores will always be the same, supporting a local distributor with sector experience and knowledge.
The North American team advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff from facilities.
Helena Herrero denied that it would be a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network intends to "improve the service to the customer and the pymes in the purchase, attention, ownership and even packaging".
Barcelona's store includes a space with a global pilot programme that is responsible for solving potential problems of HP computer security equipment.
An online service connected with a technical centre located in Maastricht (The Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that may sometimes last up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already hired technical assistance services," Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sababell warns about stealing a million customers into its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, the member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially removes a new liquidity crisis and threatens the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a disbursement of interest margins, which will try to compensate partly with commissions and credit price.
Sababell expects within three years to capture a million individual customers, its pending assignment.
Sabatell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will be valid for three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need for public aid from the FROB, is to win market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank - their large pending assignment, since they have so far been closer to SMEs and businesses than the minority client.
This year has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in enterprises it exceeds 10%.
Another of the basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the closure of productivity, or the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as a target, and whose challenges will be presented by the bank when the results of the exercise are presented.
Several banks are now reaching targets and making them public because the financial crisis has broken down all the plans of the World Bank.
Sababell will, in fact, close this year's Optima Director Plan, fixed four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation made it more extensive.
Customers who let out the storage boxes will be their main target.
On a dinner organized by the APIE, Guardianola insisted that 2011 would be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something essential for the survival of banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the passive - which penalizes the Margentes - is decreasing, the price of the risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions for liquidity is already being transferred to the price of credit to compensate for the decline of the Margentes.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the flu, but the differences are higher," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already gave the Thursday order to his network so that they would limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentiators - see Fridays of 22 and 27 November -.
He also recognized that the bank's trend is now "to raise commissions", but "there's a competitive framework".
Sabatell's management plan is based on organic growth, although the group does not always dispose of corporate operations.
Not in vain, make sure that in Spain "you're going to need bigger sizes."
"The coming year is going to move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not dissociate that some Spanish financial entity is in red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can supplement the market in the acquisition of funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important for some banks to be Vatican as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but on the contrary of what happened in June, funding can be obtained in a short time through rest, which triggers the crisis.
The ECA discharges a second oil of mergers in boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, announced yesterday that there would be an oil of storage boxes and that he would again insist on the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish storage boxes, several entities were assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Cajas de Ahorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, withdrew yesterday that this new oil of operations would be produced.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, which is what are the adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we are going to 13 or 14 but all major processes have already been carried out and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has also worked very closely," the directive pointed out.
In statements during an evening of the Aragón Directors and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is underway "as soon as possible, and we must be very satisfied with how it is going to take place within the deadlines that today, not now, were marked on business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
"To pass from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no precedent in history, reducing the number of entities in 62% to be much larger to meet Basilea," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of very little fortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and meaning," because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind us that we must be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and the "probably" of the world, and assigned it to those who put it in court.
The directive pointed out that within the current economic context, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial entities and storage boxes, a system that has undertaken a "mainly important" concentration process and that "to the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank had been very well stopped by the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro but has established conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adaptation measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies for placement or removal of EUR 426 for unencumbered benefits, up to the privatization of 49 per cent of AEA, the management of airports in Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of State Loterias.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has raised criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility in eradicating the current crisis.
How should those movements be interpreted?
Let's move forward that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of action in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is shocked by keeping the old traditions of good part of its partners.
Faced with European opposition, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by it, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems scientific fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is close to 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a revision of the euro, in line with the sister proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary burden, fines to the Transgressive Countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting the deficits, the German Government launched a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax control plans and stability in public finances), and what they were doing with their European partners, including France.
The second in front of her was the central European country when Merkel repeatedly extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were very opposed to Greece's redemption.
Finally, in the last days of October, the new Merkel emerges with a clear position, requiring reform of the Union treaties to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run at part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, since the Irish crisis has been precipitated and everything else.
But its proposal, although so refined, has been adopted and we should be involved in the Union reform process which has been possible since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that doesn't think of crossing.
And he is telling all of us that, although it is now necessary to take measures with which it may not be very agreed, since that date the former operation of the euro has been completed.
In 2013 the birth of a new monetary area, where criminal countries will be severely punished, may be obliged to declare outstanding payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a serious growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumer moderation, productivity improvements and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge savings in the balance of payments, such as the Spanish growth in boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we would do worse if we didn't understand it.
This is not just about reducing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they ask of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that current turbulence will lead to greater peace.
And let's take advantage of the opportunity that they gave us until the spring of 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have also understood this and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting on Saturday with large companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggest that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the issue of order has been opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are faced, leaving an overopened monetary area of few serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that he has already warned us.
Sports and fraud of law
Treats such as those of Alonso and Ramos before Ajax show intelligence but are not willing to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion by two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party on 23 November against Ajax in the Campeones League has resulted in the writing of ink rivers about whether such behaviour is or not anti-deportable and whether, where appropriate, both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, for a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players were deliberately wasting time on getting missing messages to cause the judge to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since the Real Madrid will already end up as leader of its group, both players will carry out the regular penalty for the next party of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass card cleaning at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sentenced two parties to the training of team coach José Mourinho, and various economic quantities to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice but rather common in the football world.
It is so extensive that it is part of the ethical, unwritten rules of this sport.
Part of the debate raised in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been staged by a team of the entity of the Real Madrid (which in its hemisphere assumes nobility and honour, and in past times has punished its players by similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode to its dilated history of historical and provocative techniques.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions are illegal by law; in fact, they are acts that are respected by the sports regulation but seem to be misleading.
The issue is to consider the kind of damage that is causing the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, which is that these actions did not put them at risk, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that are related to the clean game is to avoid the abuse of the criminal player team by the opposite team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the real Madrid players is that it is not what we normally refer to as a fraud or a fraud of law, because its violation of the rules has not been hidden to try to avoid punishment, but that its action has been more obvious in order to receive the sentence of the tribunal.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derive from the intended shortcomings under consideration.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not placed in a disadvantage or benefit in the same party, since obviously the result of the action is to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next party, because the club can't count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will begin the next phase of the League of Championships without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminateness, as the team can be removed from the first change, and in addition to this act, players perform a penalty party and pass the second card cycle, where the suspension for the accumulation of cards occurs with less than in the first cycle.
So, by going rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not against the sport spirit, which is part of strategic decisions that favour the maximum benefit of the rules.
In the assumption that we are concerned, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without ordering the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of engineering.
Poliemic, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-explosions and how the transmission of the directive was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offering officer to catch group shipping scenes in BCN
The calendar's dictatorship focuses this year on a range of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
They spread self-sustained celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tour and lotteries, with the arrival of December, they also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for Barcelona's restoration and ocean, but that because of the crisis they have decomposed in an adjusted price offensive in order to catch the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the companies and associations of the sector concerned.
In order to make accounting more complicated, the calendar of this year (the late November in Friday) has concentrated on applications on the week of December 13, with the result that up to the date of a round of dinner reservations (the 16th and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the stage of flat-flash eggs began, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective scenes on budgetary matters.
In order not to rush from tradition, many workers keep it paying off their own pocket.
In any case, some and others require war prices, the President of the Barcelona Restoration Greme, Gaietà Farrás, confirmed.
The representative of the patronage today does not hesitate to vaccinate how this month's holidays will be.
"People think so much before booking."
"I want to go out but I want to warn you about prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give good price and good service," he adds, and he recalls that customers tend to downplay a scale with the crisis, so that the franca around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments, the number of requests for the night of 17 is shown.
The Soteras group indicates that there is a genuine round of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, which they have responded to by adapting their menus to the quota, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In addition to the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has taken on a more early reservation, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 1995 to 30 euros," they explain.
AN Group, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, maintains optimism after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources point out that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate holidays.
In its six group menus, one vessel, with EUR 30 or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a pre-position to spend 10% more than last year than to require more details, such as a quaya.
There are also green bridges in some companies that invite their employees back and feel that the volume of the groups is something else.
On behalf of Mr Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Gomá, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reserves are "lived", even though customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Yes, the illusion for the parties has not come down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks' filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clear-cut and juicy details of the content of the talks and thoughts of the American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both nuclear safety countries, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - which weapons are not collected but remain stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is how Ambassador Anne W. Patterson listed it in a previous report on the visit of then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the territory under the Taliban attack, the gruesome dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is now seen, not only by the US but also by Russia, as a proliferation and motive for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most recent of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani nuclear-weapon-producing pace.
A discharge from the embassy in May, which defines "frustant" communication with Pakistan, supports: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unresponsible or are discarded".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian National Intelligence Officer, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who left "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army should end with tactical support to terrorist groups".
To the hunt of the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the counter-terrorism fight to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to follow the movements and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's only the date of 20 November.
And it should not be seen with the latest filtering of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
It was on the 20th day when the international police body with headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, as the organization has explained, consider the so-called network notice free to proceed to an arrest -- which should be brought to the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed to be Assange.
The movement has angered Assange lawyers, who yesterday published a letter accusing the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks of being willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compared with the mythic Lavrentity Pavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"This seems like a hunt, not a legal persecution," she complains.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence-- Assange remains in an unknown, but not closed.
The moon granted an interview to Time magazine director through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats living in the United Nations in violation of international treaties signed by the United States, it should be allowed," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ride and absurd" the request for resignation.
"I'm not quite sure why we should import the opinion of a guy with a web page," said the CNN chain.
Obama himself has been charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new escapes from documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the lower chamber since January, has asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or assistance they may make".
More far away, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to retreat after saying Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-government of Arkansas and possibly candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not executed would be too fine," said Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with guinea pigs in the suburbs of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural execution and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to sort out the same internal revolution in the ERA rows, without north of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his hiding is insufficient for the officers of the Exlider Joseph Lluís Cardo-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is as intense today as his own mentor and that it can in fact cause him headaches that he had with other extreme currents.
The leader of the Left will therefore try to win the new critics with guinea pigs that allow him to be blind to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers may be able to speak about their continuity in secret.
By means of paper, and not by high hand.
If carrotists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the President, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of lines wants to avoid the image of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that he would not be considered to be ratified by half of the votes, but he added, without needing percentages, that would not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
The neighbours of Carod require the President something more than their role in the military, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ among congresses.
But if you don't have enough majority to force decommissioning, they're going to try to agree with the executive a road map from here to May.
To that end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document which will be voted on by the National Council on Day 18.
Its intention is to evaluate Puigcercós instead of this promise to step up the convention in autumn 2011, something that she has already done.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "poliphony" damages stability and that its objective is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty doors inside.
In this line, it is a symmetrical result of the article that Joseph Huguet's functional adviser signed on his blog.
In view of Puigcercós's ideology, the titler of Innovation said that the leader would be re-refried "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five of the two.
First, "recompensate" the executive to represent at least 90% of the military, i.e. including new faces coming from the sector near Carod.
The second can be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once assembly as a operating mechanism.
It therefore proposes a reform of the Statutes which allows Congresses to be held through delegates elected by the suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Conglomerate Conglomerate left the task of reviewing the Assembly at a specific convention on the reform of the Statutes.
This is still pending, as the internal sea in recent years has advised us to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors at stake, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 completed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the content of MILLENIO State of Mexico, a decrease in four cases was recorded compared with 2010.
During November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILLENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the number of three women and the presence of a couple of bodies nearby in the Gulf of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, 390 deaths were reportedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one found in San Diego de los Fathers Cuexcontitlán, town of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shootings of fire and the arrow of grace on his head in addition to his legs and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the cajoule of a abandoned vehicle on the Mixtecas street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatalán, of the town of Naucalpan.
The Thursday afternoon of the four-days, ejacators found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the torax, on the Tenango-Ixtapan corner of the Hall, on the road crossing the town of Villa Guerrero.
On the side of the body a message was received by the criminal organization La Fami Michoacana.
One day in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old gentleman, he was killed by eight bullets after leaving his house to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by an impact of bullet in the head of each in the colony of San Pedro Xalochtoc, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the arrow of grace on the front, a man's corpse was found on a lonely road in the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body found a 25-calibre gun wound.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found on the channel of black water from the colony Playa Golondrina.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
The neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse found in the paradise Peña Colorada, which was held from the hands behind and with the sold head.
The man had an injury caused by a fire weapon in his neck.
In half a month there was a report of the execution of two men, who were surrounded by cobbies and abandoned in a car accident on the streets of the Breaking Villas de la Hacienda in the city of Atizapán in Zaragoza, along with the victims two death warnings were also found.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony was found surrounded by a black plastic bag of the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th round in cobbies, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the village of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who was found surrounded by a yellow cobija with blue, supposedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message his executioners left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms shots in the neck, the dead body of a woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
In the woman's skin tattoos were detected, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, a car was found on board the corpse of a man in the town of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with the enchanted head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message that was supposedly signed by a criminal organization that said: "This is what happens to those who don't agree."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and arrest of feet and hands were found two bodies inside a taxi left behind at the San Agustín Colonia Centre for Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one was decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was surrounded by black plastic bags, tied with tape pen and along with a message; the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag along the streets of the Juárez Colonia.
Along with him, the agents found a cartel with a message.
Maintaining China's objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured her country that she had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon dioxide and explained that she supported her offer to reduce between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce between 40 and 45 per cent its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, provided Su Wei, representative of that country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Her Wei assured her country that her country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon dioxide and to convert her industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it was clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He pointed out that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these works, progress has been made, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives set for reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the states and locals to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it is sufficient that several multi-year plans are in place or have already been concluded, both funded by the Chinese Government and by Governments of other countries.
For example, it referred to the Programme for the Effective Use of Energy, which was implemented over the last five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial project for climate change is also underway, another for changing the focus of rescuers and one more mitigation and adaptation, it detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of that country on climate change, ensured that China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, exposure to greenhouse gas emissions in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of its historical contribution to pollution.
He has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the last five years and planning to do so by 2020.
Attached to the legitimate expulsion of Espino: Caesar Nava
The National Director of the PAN explained that the former Panist Director was entitled to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what his right was to be.
PAN's national leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was linked to legality and that the former Panist leader was entitled to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what his right to.
In an interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo protesting as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino was a decision taken in the local area.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, in his case, to the National Council's Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, it was clear that it was not time to think in 2012 and that there was never an alliance for the presidential candidate at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was said to be convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which it will have to be elected to its successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) was a topic that had never been at the negotiating table, at least not now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he recalled.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "do not fear internal competition; "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he quoted.
He said that the Council would no doubt be able to choose the best or best director who requires National Action for the next three years, from which he will deliver the statement "to whom the Council decides."
"I have that absolute silence and openness, to any of the five would be proud to give you the office of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the answer recorded by the party in the previous elections of 4 July would be reflected in the following content, although "it is not time to think in 2012."
"So far we are trying to join Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three Governments that have signed alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause of observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes, aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabon will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the criticisms of PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, Caesar Nava invited the prizers to reflect on the sexes of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than Fox and Calderon; they're beginning to defend them; they're out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive could make statements like those he had made in his speech at the National Court of Auditors, because there is no fraud or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree to adopt the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has today submitted a national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social Twitter network.
"If you agree to approve the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its short message maintains a cybernetic link with a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote of legislation is imminent.
"With a vote waiting soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," she says.
The message was made public after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless the extension of the Bush tax cuts and government funding was approved.
This blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue was resolved, a calendar could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think it's been a long time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some time on that and then we can plan the rest of the sequence," he said.
The leader of the majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "close debate" vote for the Dream Act law, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States 16 years ago, have remained in the country for the last five years and have entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the participants require 60 votes in favour of the initiative, which requires the competition of a number of Republicans, while the project's partner organizations provide an intensive capacity to ensure the adoption of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 scenes.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against it, and only one Republican voiced his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, the parties to the Dream Act require several Republicans to join them if other democracies decide to support the initiative.
Among the most condemned republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have declared that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put your finger on the needle
The second round of The pleasure of the language was a walk where participants made a gala of the narrative
"That of the Sex in the Language I understand it but... the finger in the tongue? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of Loves of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitles of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to The Sex in the Language, he explained).
The finger on the shoulder... "Puts us in apricots," the Argentine writer kindly appeared to the public, mostly of young people, who was quoted at the International Fair of the Guadalajara Book (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he gave to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "laga" is, he goes to a doctor, who does not get answers even on the same narrative.
From the infectologist it is convinced that "patience is not my strength, perhaps my weakness."
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen the comfort in the middle of the passport, but who makes it clear that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The lake is the real open, the symbol is the scarcity".
The protagonist was relieved and concluded "from the law I only got to know that it is real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and language trappings should be very interfering.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delicate narrative entitled Praise of the invention, where the finger on the lake is not named but is now discovered.
With paintings of magical realism, the account of a famous witch, who also touched clouds, brought back to men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a doll, a statement that he had come to speak later in America, the great novel that he had not missed since the beginning of his own chroniclers who counted it and quoted Bernal Díaz of Castillo who criticized the excess of the account by the conqueror's captains.
"Servants who invented us all (the writers) made a noise of the fine witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise it would never have come to tell the story of America in imagination that he lacked until the dust."
However, he highlighted "the jokes and embusters who best imagine" and is where he verifies reality and lies, where it is no longer known that the story belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its support.
It's actually called "serventin tradition."
"For his inheritance we are the ones who are accounted for."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montero quoted and praised the variety of interpretations that took place the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the shoulder.
The Cuban-Portuguese pointed its way towards the great link between social violence that goes through its country - and share Latin America - a product of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs will conclude a tacit commitment which is of course not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night she closed the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also stressed "from that finger in the arm of the writer's compromised writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in captivity, as well as in intellectual customs and control of consciences that are rooted in dogmas, he forgot "that behind every statement there is a small non-and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be possessed of our thinking and to be possessed of the reality we have to mate: and maturing means many times putting your finger on the bed and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, white and black, in established ideas and without matrices and also bothering the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting them to find the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three final victories, he's got high on his career, but he's been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, two different styles are also faced by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three final victories, he has had high scores in his career, but he has learned to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although he has so far gone white and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
Argentinian has finished comforting himself with the basement medal, a step behind the winners has been taken and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategy came to its first stage as a trainer in the Open Tour 2002, when it took the rest of Morelia with which it fell global from 4-2 before Toluca; then, in 2003 it also came to the decisive sadness and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, in the Bicentenary tournament 2010, once again before the Devils, Rubén again suffered a relapse, since his team finished 2-2 in front of the runners after 210 minutes of the game, but in the gang of penalists he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to finish the title for three finally his players fell down from the 11th steps and suffered the turn 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same fate, he's trying to get out of trouble and can first celebrate a title, although he claims that it's the most important for him.
"I want to go out, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an affair I owe me and therefore the title will come to me, but the previous one is most important," said the chairman when he was asked about the numbers that he has against playing finals.
Very strong has the previous end, of which, as he has assured, has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the end-of-the-art judge can't celebrate, we're ready for the radio, the players too, because the previous time, with two punishments for shooting we were already ready to go out and I think it's a teaching, until the party is over, we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "One never tries to get to the criminal tag, one tries to end at regular time, but sometimes there is no other and there is need to be prepared, in the previous round we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game of fate, sometimes by nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but if it was us, that left us something for this end that we expect does not reach that court".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technical subject camper and to prove for the first time the glory that titles give.
EU changes rules to obtain visas
Persons must attend the Service Centres for Visa Applicants before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011, the procedure for transmission of a visa to the United States Embassy will be changed.
In the new procedure, most applicants should attend the Service Centres for Visa Applicants (ASC) for their signatures before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the prospectors, including:
The total cost of processing visas will be lower, and no payment will be required to negotiate the appointment, another payment to process visa applications and more so that the message service will deliver the document.
The appellant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for trade and investor visas.
People who want to renew their eyes will not have to have an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only listen to the ASC closer to where they will present their documents and take their needles.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants requiring a second date to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this less time than in the past.
Also, those applying for visas in the Consulates in Juárez City, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra duty rate of $26.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present a finding tomorrow that would affect the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will inform you tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life exists.
The meeting will be presented in a press tomorrow morning at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astronomy, described as the task of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In citing the press, NASA ensured that it would present "a finding that would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures at our side and in hostile environments that were considered inviolable, and would put them on the table to become intelligent humans if conditions in which they live improved.
It seems to be a microbiosis that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too vengeful for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, creation uses the arsenic as a way of survival and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our favorable atmosphere.
Astrobiologists say, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will let you know the real extent of the findings at the tomorrow press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest month of Saturn), under the view that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block 'oppositor
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, leading to the arrival of 'bipartidism', they complained.
The 60 legislation was not set up when a opposition block emerged in Congress, headed by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared independent, and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' in the Chamber.
Prior to the establishment of the 60th Legislative Conference, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezekiel Reynos Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'trenaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with 'bipartidism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, he explained that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He explained that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they do not, then they would be re-enacted by both parties and thus ended the opposition coalition.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, not even having the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are similarities and that is why they are meeting a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that after being monopolical, the Congress would now be "dupolic".
"It is not the spirit of reform of the law that there is an eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are chatting with other partners so that they can be more, the convergent is enough.
Ezekiel Reynouso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress is currently becoming a 'bothin' between two, in addition to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now you're dividing it between two."
Mr Montalvo, asked for respect for the candidate's personality, was given his place at the negotiating table.
"That is not because of co-operating agreements, it is left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, which urges the five that we see, separated by different fractions, we have decided to unify ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, which is the subject that in the reform they have agreed on, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
They sell $200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatlán Unit another check on the electricity company's own issue.
More than 200 thousand weights per check for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the Association.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company is up to 1 million 200 billion weights.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 by the amount of 200 000 144.56 weights under the concept of "payment of accounts".
Mr. Luis Miguel López Moreno had progressed to pay more money from the Commune for this supplier, which was observed by the State's Supreme Auditorium for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing due to being sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, he's just paying for what he owes, just like the rest of the suppliers," said an interview.
The last checks "represented" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law states when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasurer has ensured that they have not re-use their services.
The previous, following a review by Noroeste on 25 July, published a review of the checks issued by the Unit to its suppliers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the third quarter of the Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez, in Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million weights to the municipality, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he covered checks for more than 3 million weights.
I need to look after tourist sites.
They complain about the bad conditions of the Sanchez Taboade in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a flood of the glorious Sanchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad shape and to design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Dorada Zone, recalled that on various occasions they have complained that the image of destination is being taken care of and that it is the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the banquets had affected because tourists came across and saw the disorder and took it back to nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea of what the money is missing, or otherwise they won't do the work in so long and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall showed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Association.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid it again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not only fall into correction," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the Union must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also shine lightless and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadido de Mazatlán.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come does not depend solely on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has purity in its beaches, its apartments, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions," he said.
"No due attention has been paid and this kind of fact highlights something that is unknown to everyone, maintenance is missing."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be placed online together with the municipality and be given priority to having the city on the day, clean, orderly and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
" Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to order first, clean up and put us on line to make them attractive so that they can be included in the inventory that we have to promote the destination."
Requires IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to be an example of seeing a better Signora for the various challenges they face.
A worthy and free labour legislation between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsive Signola that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, 60 legislation has been installed, integrated by seven political forces, 19 PAN MPs, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two PRD, one PT, one Convergence and one PVEM, which totals a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that clean and compromise management will be carried out with society and the various sectors which require responsible legislative work and which do not repeat the same patterns of partyism or patriarchalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the recent 40 members of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of seeing a better Signora for the various challenges facing them.
"We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because it is a custom to make arrangements to protect their own interests and become charismatic comparators of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
That is why he said that they should confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that they take before the Governor in turn.
"We work for them to do a decent job, especially committed to society and sectors, because they were the signalists who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Island Hotel Association, considered one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives to push and take forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complex.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators take into account the weight of the State budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with less budget and is inconsistencies as an important economic activity and currency-generating and investment-generating activity and that it directly competes with the industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to assist in providing security to the State and in updating the Alcoholic Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.
Looking for a bad king
Moons, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For her parents, the next Day of Reyes will be difficult to satisfy her illusions, as her home is consistent with nothing more than 12 people and a chip.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Michael do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives in the day because the father does not have a stable job.
"So sometimes we see her hard because my husband doesn't have any shoes, but we sell mandarin and dad... I'll go out with 'blebes' to sell the street," said Kayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adalaida, aged 4, wants a baby or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, who is 3 years old, would like a baby Barbie.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long dreamed of having a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayeta suggests cut clothing for a year.
"He told me (Joseph Alfredo), 'I'd like this monster', but I told him 'we'd see a child', because he was very facey," reminded Cayeta with sadness.
For older children, those in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
The 14-year-old Joseph Juan is missing, so a couple of size five and a half or six would be of much help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign Search for a King Mago, giving a game or effective at the reception of Noroeste.
Forty drug traffickers detained
Wednesday, in Austria, a decade of persecution has taken place in the context of the demining of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Forty persons have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecution has occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 Cannabis plants have been planted, four kilos of hachis, money and equipment for production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to compare in Sherbrooke's court of justice the following hours to their detention.
The charges of Cannabis' production could be dealt with with, inter alia, with the purpose of trafficking, counterfeiting and theft of services.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted for nearly a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out detention," Mr. Ruel said.
In this police operation, some seventy agents participated in the Quebec Security Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department.
We can fight against clandestine migration without problems
The Conservatives ' Bill, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of landlocked migrants' parents, will certainly face a great opposition, as the three parties of the opposition have announced the Wednesdays that they could not support.
"I'm mainly based on the letter."
"I'm here with a party that has created the granite you're making," said liberal director Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the draft law in its current form, which would allow for up to one year to stop any person from a ship identified as transporting clandestine migrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong white.
"We are against and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government is doing," Mr. Duceppe said.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with the clandestine immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against clandestine patriarchs, and that is what we intend with another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and holds children in custody for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of politicians and of ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a plague."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead to elections as a result of its refusal.
However, a conservator has informed the QMI agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that each member who is going to oppose would be explained later to his voters.
The new unit does not get unity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with New York's Department of Research since January last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday's announcement has been filled with surprises to more than one.
It should be said that, during a permanent meeting of the Council on Quebec police services held last October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the criticism of the Québeque party that dealt with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad as "a couple removed from the castle" and as "a capucher solution of the last hour".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," just say.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public investigation.
"The more Mr Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this research committee, the more people share our opinion, the more he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a research commission is with Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, it suggests Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general intervention to conduct an investigation into corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general intervention," he concludes.
He also considered that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent framework is not the only project in January in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be from the Prosecutor of the Marteau Operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed by his part that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is now inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being closely monitored due to the strong assumptions that have been recorded in several regions of the province since March.
The afternoon afternoon an earthquake occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have evacuated their homes.
During the night, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday at night, several regions recorded strong assumptions, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now to Thursday at night, depending on the region.
The sectors located in the north of the river and in the Otaouai Valley were the most affected.
They could get up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these assumptions are compounded by the wish of the snow that has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will be depleted.
On Wednesday night, Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Oueau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chenea, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitations have caused some lakes to be depleted in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have attracted a provisional bridge.
As a precautionary measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the decommissioning of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the town of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit remains alert and monitors the situation near, as Annik Bouchard, security adviser, has indicated.
The Quebec Growth Prediction Centre, by its part, issued Wednesday announcements by communicating the growing strengths of several rivers, in particular Maskinogé, Assomption, Oueau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Culpan partially to Dupont
The representative of Quebec Stéphane Dupont's radio has been subjected to a certain revision before the Canadian Council of Radio Standards (CCNR) by controversial statements regarding social and Haitian assistance, as well as its gross language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an inappropriate negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who have committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to comments made on emissions released between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of Persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable data and not lead to fraud.
In relation to suicide, the presentation by Stéphane Dupont had shown that suicide was a cowardly act.
Most of the Committee's members have come to the conclusion that the message delivered was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a delicate issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any blame has been dropped in this regard.
The last argument referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had noted a media confrontation that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI representative stated that he had not made any donation to help the Haitians because he could not be sure if the needers would really receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive but that their cumulative effect constitutes an inappropriate negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My consignee has been clean for a year and a half," said the rapporteur.
In all decisions, the Committee condemns the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "including more than what is required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, inter alia, declare decisions once in the hearing hours within a period of three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The exhibit of Algerian origin Nacerddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, which highlights "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai box, goes up to the world's tattoos and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal, who has been living in the Metropolis since 2008 to progress at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek battles everywhere because for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and a employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the kickboxing categories full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished between the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's interesting that I've been making progress in each competition."
"At this stage, I'll be the first time this year or the next year!"
The "san show" or "sanda" is an original Chinese discipline that allows you to hit with your fingers and feet, as well as launch your enemies to the ground.
The interviews are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pupigist in this type of fight is the American of Vietnamese Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to keep a competition in his career, he will no doubt join the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the sympathetic boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first battle, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but he has lost it in the end.
"What has won me is a true professional," I think.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are faced at the end of their category."
"Next, each category's champions face to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts of $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this scale of more than one hundred contracts, there is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has received no prior invitation to the most important contract, the management of the project, by a total of 295 million.
The Consortium, called Energy Guarantee, was created in 2004 on the basis of the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project of $5,000 million.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Guarantee Consortium obtained the contract without prior public tender.
For the Québeque Party, the use of corporate associations poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and the elimination of competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," said the Czech Party MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press show.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because, he said, he did not understand how to benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that a collapse has occurred with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "done" and "with lack of strength".
He pointed out that "minimum" would be that the PQ would apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to an offer for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the work.
The work has already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been granted without competition being in play; it has been negotiated.
Furthermore, the formula of the consortiums has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Debor published last week, the formula for associations in the technical advice sector is being submitted to an investigation in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's commercial register allows more than 200 consortiums to be identified, some of which appear permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as ICMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Guarantee Consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of Bahia James responds to a dynamic of particular work and Hydro-Québec has been specifically responsible for it since the 1970s".
The chief executive of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract granted to the Energy Guarantee Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the examination, Le Debor has identified 109 technical advice contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their branches, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has received 22 contracts, Genivar received 16, Teksult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Security.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amounted to $449,783,344, including the security energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has said that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "financial", before it needs to be treated better than its managers.
Consumer barometer responsible. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
The consumer only relies on sustainable development actors, as well as on fair trade brands and environmental certificates to guide his or her elections.
According to the responsible Consumer Barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is forced into a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumer, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even violates its commitment.
Even if consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, Quebecese seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not rely on the environmental commitment of companies or the ecological advertising of companies themselves, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates bearing the products they call fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "responsible", says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecese speakers take this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about a third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the questionable nature of information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecese say that they also rely on the alleged performance of the environmental products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
A 61 per cent priority has been given to purchases in the shops of their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food grown in their region, notes Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of 100 points this year), the Human Consumers of Quebec likes to take over the king's role of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fashion.
However, according to Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (from its car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of the Quebecese indicated that they had used public transport or shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this broad behavior survey, which just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycles and foot-and-mouth movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has asked for financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris film complex after the Angus and Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus and Parallèle Development Society, which expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois again the film set eXcentris in the St. Laurent bubble and return her real movie vocation, did not get what they requested.
The Government has agreed to involve itself in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised to the bottom.
The President of the Development Society of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who led the eXcentris expedition, forwarded a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a decade ago.
However, the SDOEC received a counterproposal from the office on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State grant should be completely dismissed.
We recall that Quebec's Association of film owners and cinematographic complexes opposed a direct state investment in support of eXcentris recovery, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various sector representatives claim considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same company, has been responsible for ten years for the author's film in his complex premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasure Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films turns out to be patented in Montreal and eXcentris had known to be loyal to its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, push for its part a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to open its way to the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "From men et des diaux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not come back to contact Le Debor and we do not know what he and his group of proposals to the bottom they have received.
Raised the view of completed Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to the United States, but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of these latter to Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canadian-United States relations when they vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer more interesting details than really substantial.
A cable of 22 September 2008, i.e. during a full federal electoral campaign, reports how far the United States does not get into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"I wish the political leaders were provided with a set of practically inferent inferiority to Canadians at the time of addressing daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he wrote.
Therefore, it concludes that the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "inseparable silence" because the two countries maintain strong political and economic relations.
"Llogically, I think, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, more importantly, of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think at the time of voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will contribute to ensuring the survival of the Government during the February ' s confidence vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will record for the first time a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000," Mr. Breese writes.
There is no mention that the Government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid the replacement of the coalition or that opposition parties were able to survive as the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series distributed in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which makes some subtle references to Maher Aar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappers for the CIA to carry out enquiries.
Another cable finds that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some of Guantánamo's prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that depends on "every case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has given a document to the State Secretary in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the consignee."
Finally, we can mention that the anims have been heated over WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States there are Mike Huckabee's echoes.
A global plan to refresh lighting
Today, the United Nations has proposed in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundreds of countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in a quantity that is practically equivalent to a third of the additional reduction that must be implemented to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is based on a set of major concrete projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to offset the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if fire-fighting bombs, which are still monopolized between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, were replaced by fluorinated bombs or, even better, by electromagnetic diode bombs (DEL or "LED"), most of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GEI emitted on the planet for human enlightenment would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emerging countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce GGE emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that quantity should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures at two centigrade degrees to avoid decontrolling it.
In fire-fighting bombs, 95% of energy is split in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. a 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorinated bombs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bombs, energy consumption is again reduced twice more.
The fluorescent bombs will take an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than an inhaler bomb, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved by the replacement plan that would be applied in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also work with waste and emit very little heat.
Above all, they don't contain anything of mercury.
Several experts have demonstrated their reservations with regard to fluocompact bombs, since they contain mercury and must be eliminated as hazardous residues, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluorinated bombs, but carbon thermal centres, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity from fire-fighting bombs.
Only in the United States, such centres emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report describes the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save thousands of dollars per year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. equivalent to 3.5 thermal plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Costa de Marfil looks forward to the announcement of electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa de Marfil, as they have extended the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce provisional results immediately," a spokesman from the United Nations Chief Executive said.
"Ask all parties from Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and avoid any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without publishing the results, three days since Sunday's scrotum.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the Chairman of the ECI had commented on television that the Commission "continued working" to announce the results.
Wednesdays have multiplied around the world the demands that CEI finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent, Alassane Ouattara.
However, the gang of Gbagbo has been afloat by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (UN) since the fall of the State in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Costa de Marfil, has stated that the intimidation operations of the UN electors in the north of the country had forced the President's followers to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
Now, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political coalition of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who rejects any relationship with the former rebels, has "unacceptable" the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
Their allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that making a complaint before the Constitutional Council after the fact that the electoral commission has prevented the dissemination of the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidentials, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a divided country in two years.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday to the political class in Côte d'Ivoire that possible acts of violence could be considered responsible.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bedié (25 per cent of the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the temporary seasonal changes (CVE) published by the Insea.
The number of stops is 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and seek or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a new increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were in a standstill in the sense of ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in peer pressure among older people, up to 6.4 per cent in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, up to 6.6 per cent with DOM.
Only a balance of 25-49-year-olds has been recorded with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly parity rate, after a polemy on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) on Tuesday in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the President-in-Office of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, has been investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Lyons, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of allegedly fraudulent public contracts investigation.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, abuse of funds and public property, coverage, active corruption, traffic of influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will answer all the questions asked by the judge, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue it by a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," had told AFP his lawyer, Florence Raul, before his client's comparability.
Mr. Guerini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, wanted to pass a document to explain himself through his lawyers to the judge before his comparability.
Wednesday night they also started investigating and jailing one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to deal with the verterior who should manage.
With regard to the assignment of contracts or the destination of funds related to their implementation, he does not know anything about it, says Simon's letter.
In the context of this consignment, it is also being investigated from Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration services of Aubagne, because of mistrust of funds and complexity, but has left him in conditional freedom and has prohibited him from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been denied to him."
"The instructor has taken into account the explanations and has left him free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Wednesday night, four other persons were questioned and left free, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of the property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "transaction of passive influence and corruption".
Two staff members of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bingier have been questioned by "substantiation and abuse of public property by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complexity in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the people facing Mr. Guérini is Stephen Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Córcega.
Researchers suspect that their societies have a service to blank the capital of big banditism.
The investigation is under several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the residual sector.
A source close to the investigation indicates that research focuses on the conditions of the assignment and operation of a verterior in La Ciotat, which collects wastes from Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marsella (MPM).
Subject Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exceeded Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "spionage", has been in public in France, has warned of diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attention of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the United States until he gives advice to manage his own "rehens" crisis in Iran (a small group of senders).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youth did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram published on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostages".
Eliseo's counselor for strategic issues, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held in force in Iran.
"Doled noise," they say, "always" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocentness", "immediate freedom".
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because once attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are ignored, "silence won't solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "an ordinary Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political singing".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day on which he will be deported to France's embassy) "will require the subscription to Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000 compensation).
In addition, she points out that Elisha anticipates other crises of revenge, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in a near future stop each other from about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison after twelve days, but he is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in electronic material intended for Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, doubt this foreign match.
For Washington, which is near the Iranian clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand's prison is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian instead of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it wasn't.
Elisha, he says, not only "has been greatly surprised by the decision of the judge", but has tried to oppose himself.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision", he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand continues under the "close" surveillance of the French information services.
Eliseo's adviser marks a number of telephones, calls and then informs US diplomats that Iran "is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, Eliseo was not involved in efforts, using communications and "fugs" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The U.S. observe this activity with some irony and ensure that manipulation brings its fruit, since several press articles transmit the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials".
What such "thank you" is due to Mr Assad is asked by the embassies in Paris.
"In spite of their full statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led to Elisha's footing.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which, "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, has just been put to death by premeditation and abuse".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries "to show Syria the praise that can be collected if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "seed the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows it from good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, if we're grateful."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at Elisha.
In a communiqué, we thank the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean youths can't play online
The South Korean Government is going to adopt a law called "from Cenicenta" that will prevent adolescents from engaging in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gambling companies to block access to those games after midnight to young people under the age of 16, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then it becomes difficult for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, you need.
The Government is also planning to ask companies that limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, the responsible added.
In addition, it will be made available to those who request it for free computer programs that allow you to limit Internet time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the indisputable champion of the global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals at World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designated the host countries
In the midst of the turmoil caused by the suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints Thursday to the world Cup host countries of 2018 and 2022, a clear political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come first on technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional discipline bastion (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation expects to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia), after an alien on the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's Emir, heads of Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World.
Transactions between buyers, therefore, may last up to the last minute.
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations leading to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the opportunities of his country, including football, which only once welcomed the World in 1966.
The BBC added a line to the moon when a document was circulated to three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disappoint FIFA and shame the English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in his head.
The Head of Government is looking forward to re-editing the successful hit by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of JJ.O. 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to recover England’s brightness before the EC?
It is not clear, since the second Spanish-Portuguese also has many strong points thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OOO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial perspectives of both countries could fall under their ambitions.
The possible reflections against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are the only thing they can do is to give points to Russia, which is converted into a weight outsider despite the gaps in their candidacy (secondary, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct austerity to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"You're going out of your dirty tracks, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to have the most logical advantages.
The first world economic power and headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new candidates appear to be premature for two countries that have organized the seminar together in 2002.
Another risk: the 2026 World Grant to China, which is strongly desired by the FIFA, would cause Asia to remain without possibilities for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on future stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than you are sure.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of paid TV rights (in view of the time difference) by European countries, the back end of the FIFG war.
Second mandate: the test
Of Gaulle he really had doubts.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he had doubts.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicholas Sarkozy is still less.
An assignment in Elisha leads to another.
The current Head of State will therefore be re- candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match the mystery which is often associated with the presidential function.
So there's always a need to be suspicious.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he did not withdraw a third mandate.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some point in October 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night in Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to a certain revolution.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
Just transmit the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time I'm talking about the presidentials, with a playful tone, in encounters of this kind.
"In the worst, or the best, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he was released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "You didn't think I wouldn't plant what would happen later."
Your earlier statements do not go any further to the candidate, nor do they go further.
They support comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career by the candidate in the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone up to the palace what leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that its 2012 candidate is clear is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is being organized before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's candidate to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the topic in the UMP," the Prime Minister's environment has reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You will always think you can win," corrected Alain Juppé, quoted before the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to keep its acquisitions of State Letter
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to specify the way out of the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations which should end at the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Emission Institute will certainly not be allowed to be so perpendicular if it does not want to risk aggravating a more complex situation in European debt markets today.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Yesterday, during a press show, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, has supported the ECB's active role in solving the debt crisis of European States.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example, by increasing its State obligations purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my European partners."...
The Friday, in Brussels, during its hearing before the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer concerned about his intentions, noting that the state's written purchase programme in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" at the meeting of the young people.
The only clear thing is that the ECB will keep its main invariable type in 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of assets by the ECB has doubled last week to around EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the market’s indirect operators, yesterday it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities by a amount of EUR 67,000 million since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will continue their purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant road changes.
Although loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, it is still carrying out limited liquidity allocations under beneficial conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists hope that this device will be extended today for a few months.
"I don't think it's going to change your program considerably."
"If not, I would run the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commercebank.
"It seems most likely that a progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011, will be produced," he predicted by Norbert Bréms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of such obligations for the market to remain stable", adds Norbert Bréms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the Emission Institute has no choice to keep its presence on the market.
"The lack of investors on the market should be compensated at any price and act in such a way as to prevent a high level of income from the most fragile States," he said yesterday.
Because, if the types of interest are placed by the clouds, States will have more problems to reduce their debt or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi has taken over the period
After Italy began the week of alarmingly, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the return of the types of obligations for 10 years.
A recovery of peace would be premature.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents stated that they had listened to Giulia Tremonti to qualify for the situation of "unencryptable" and that a week's end was expected "unforeseen", statements subsequently rejected by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday, the difference with the long-term German types had reached the recorded number of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of fraud (CRQ) had been dropped to 263 points, leading to a certain revolution in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the slowdown of the income associated with it, causing the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels have been a cold water hole for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on a number of 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (before 3.9% of government estimates) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties, for a amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
It currently has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying from time to time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate, short and long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are less than those required in other countries," says Pierre Carlo Paduan, head of OECD economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, after which elections could be held at the end of March.
In such a case, there would be a little useful period of decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has said yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, by night and by day, that Europeans are clearly solid, determined, committed to the defence of their currency and the monetary zone."
Although relatively relative, yesterday's delay in the types of obligations of European States has moved governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a normalization principle.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common white in the current speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," say economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than market rate".
Aware of this crisis and its hidden dangers, European countries are intensifying the debate to strengthen existing exit mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance which are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are well on the way.
And this also takes into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB will meet today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market corridor (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFEFF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to inform the investors of the East Bank about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly to prepare the land.
The first EAFRD securities issue is expected to be carried out next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States has entrusted the Reuters agency to the United States to support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
With regard to the countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are accompanied by austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path from that followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid all costs of seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase confidence in a sustainable way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds are finally faced with options available to speed up the process of standardisation of public debt markets.
On 24 November, by Paris, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the EUR 750,000 million mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would have no doubt about withdrawing the paper again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor in the European public debt market, consider that an amount of around EUR 100,000 million would be sufficient, "p preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently available at EUR 60,000 million.
A Council which would no doubt be able to examine European capital in detail.
In particular, if market conditions are not met.
Snow and ice: 24-star apartments
Snowflakes continue to cause traffic problems, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on alert due to the risk of snowflakes and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already in alert Naranja, 18 from Wednesday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group by night.
According to Météo France, the falling snows affecting the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also slightly snowed on the island of France.
Snow layers are expected between 2 and 5 cm, at point between 7 and 10 cm, in affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armore, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of the Netherlands, France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause traffic problems and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to vehicles weighing more than 7,5 tons, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, traffic in the UK secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it be driven only if necessary and that certain TER vehicles have been prohibited during the day.
During the winter, school transport in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measure had been envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
Prefecture "invites all drivers to drive with greater caution on the streets and adapt their behaviour to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested air carriers to cancel their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to the planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers be contacted with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial clearers
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, thousands of millions have flown.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23,000 million for the Great Paris metro which must be built by the Grand Paris Society.
In order to initiate this GSP, the State has announced a allocation of EUR 4,000 million.
At the theoretical level, this will be the sum that will later enable the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The Corrections Act 2010, which was considered at the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: to create a special equipment tax and increase the tax on offices on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set out in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a change in a tax on offices that already exist "to modernise it, increase its product and assign such an increase to the Great Paris Society".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no numbers in the text.
But it's worth 4,000 million.
"It is necessary that the tax resources be added to the EUR 4,000 million of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and be granted to the Grand Paris Society as the project progresses," we can read in the statement of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used in accordance with the requirements."
The GDP estimates that it will start to receive 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4,000 million promised are not included in the credit, can cause a slightly inflexible parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Sellers' hackers and powerful spy
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears to be only scandalous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each shipper created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations on the sexual customs of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months in any periodical (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's left-wing profile takes a lot of time giving idea to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The standard that secret agents should only be trained by public knowledge is essential for the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (on the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This is not only due to the authors of hidden texts who do not want to do immediate research (or don't know where to look for news about the absent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism do not just trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to confidential shippers.
The informant is peresic, just as he is perous (or has little concern) the chief of the secret services (if he can't be, I know, editor of the Liberation), who only considers what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the US Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published last week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these sentients caused such a revelation?
On the one hand, they only say what every farmer already knows, namely that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic role and, except for some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, so we just don't seem to know it for hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world has a considerable impact on the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "poisonous".
But we're stuck in the real nature of what happened.
In the past, in the time of Orwell, he could be conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has been fulfilled since, able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, a hotel visited, a bust taken, the citizen would thus become a complete victim of power eye.
But when it is shown, as is now, that not even the secrets of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the winner of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you provide a power that you can no longer even keep your own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public field; but discovering, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has not hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by such a powerful force?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any information on the network, since it would be like publishing it in a full-way cartel.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it cannot be expected to keep confidential conversations on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to discover if and when a Head of State has moved into a plane and has been contacted by one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, at the moment, my prediction is something of science fiction and, therefore, novelty, but I imagine government agents who are discreetly moving into uncontrollable travels, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as a matter of fact, hiding some data written in the pockets of their shoes.
This information is then stored in a single copy in locked boxes: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that technology is now moving forward as a cancer, i.e. towards the back.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a telegraph with cables (phones).
Video tapes (analogues) had enabled film researchers to study a film step-by-step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the mount secrets, while now the CDs (digital) only allow for chapter progress or retrocession, i.e. huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, with the moves that take us, we need three hours and a half.
Therefore, it is not unusual that the policy and communication techniques bring us back to horse cars.
A final comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was secretly being done in the embassies.
Currently, they are the embassies who ask for confidential information in the press.
Climate: France's chapters in its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether rapid funding promises (called fast start or early) have been met by developed countries.
And the French hats have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30,000 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed to providing EUR 7,200 million in three years and France EUR 1,260 million (i.e. 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best cards to convince its partners that its commitment to fixed-start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, a large supplementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was a valuable result and was appreciated for what it really was: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2,200 million in 2010, which is in the right way to meet its 7.200 million commitment in 2012.
But if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that additional efforts are made, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one who chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as reference the year 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years for fixed start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references as regards the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds.
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro paid is equal to a given euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is appropriate to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a given euro... As much as it should be calculated for its commitments the cost of the loan to the country which grants the loan (i.e. equivalent to a kind of interest).
But France does not find such a valid reason: "respects" its 420 million-euro commitment by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% grants (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100 per cent of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast-start funding, France has committed a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions in time and, on the other, in relation to real financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it is possible to make the impression that it costs 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who has been occupied with arbitration) could have a double negative impact within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply deliver) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not deaf...
The chapter of early financing is a short-term minority in relation to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand more in the vast machine that is the CMNCC.
We hope it doesn't.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with a view to respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could advance the debate on the long-term funding posts (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not be exempt from the issue of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and use of loans would contribute to improving the level of confidence needed for progress in negotiations.
Warning about pesticides administered by children
A 10-year-old child engages in a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published by the Association of Generations Futures (the former movement of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed but are illustrations of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets from Oise and Paris between July and September the food that often consumes a child of about ten years in four meals and a time of day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in the laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely cancers and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances that can be treated as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, legal limits are not exceeded for each of the chemical substances individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is worrying," says the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain only one tenth of possible cancer residues and three considered safe cancers, as well as about twenty residues that can damage the hormone system.
The manzan, imported from Brazil, intended as a time-limit for the college, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green Jews of Kenya, including food, in which the study has detected traces of a strong insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian fette, the banana tuna and even the bread bar or chicile were added with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the flu, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chlorforms.
In the scene, the salmon wheel was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk posed by these "contaminants cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) Alliance has proposed, on its part, "in the face of the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to prevent "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
