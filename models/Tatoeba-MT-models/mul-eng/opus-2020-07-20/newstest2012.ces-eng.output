Parliament did not support the new liberation of Timoschenk
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament has refused to withdraw the proposal within the framework of the new criminal law paragraph on which the opposition of Julia Tymošenkov was assessed.
The regulation which would open the way for the release of the imprisoned extremists was rejected when the second reading of the proposal for a reduction of penalties for economic delinquency.
In October, Tymoshenk was sentenced to seven years in prison to conclude a seemingly inappropriate contract with Russia on the purchase of land oil.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal shall be handed down by the court in December.
Tymoshenk points out the judgment on the political dilemma of the regime, the suspicion of the court's involvement has also led to proceedings in the West.
The proposal that paragraph 365 of the criminal law should appear, on the basis of which the express judge was judged, supported the vote of 147 Members.
His approval required 226 votes.
Libya's victory
The experience of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its defeat.
Muammar Kadáfi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him after the war.
There's still a definition of victory.
As is common in the country, the elections welcome Islamists, but it's whether it's moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has acceded to the customary court law and we have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because for theft, the hand is cut off.
Women may forget about emancipation, any withdrawals from the faith wait for correction and so on.
Instead of the dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will join the corner.
In Libya there will be a series that we can't imagine and which we would definitely not want.
Only because our way of life is not the only one, neither objectively the best and most likely he would not have answered the Libyans just mentioned for the change.
In fact, it is the belief that Islamists took refuge with the help of faithless dogs.
The only regret is that from their point of view, NATO did not direct any general from America, rather than Alah, whose size was praised in each of these policies.
So when they're looking for victory in Libya, the west of them doesn't belong.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our policies saved a political union in the dictator's person, without guaranteeing any advantage.
After the pure bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryizing Libya.
The local problem with the "crowds" is that.
But they're going to have no hard-core companies for a huge Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough and the West will finally be able to exploit the inevitable protection of human rights.
If that doesn't tell us that, you know, the law of magic.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe
Statistics of deaths were passed across Europe on Tuesday.
The United States published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has been interdependent, Germany and France have grown.
The long-term market, but today it's making records.
Investors are no longer only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Raków and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary reports on economic development in the third quarter.
HDP Germany grew by 0.5% expected, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany looked better than expected (increased by 0.3% instead of 0.1% of the original), and France indicated that it showed a moderate decrease of 0.1% (original data spoke about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of the year.
On the other hand, the gross domestic product (HDP) was suspended and, according to the ČSU, the trend was thus confirmed by the gradual slowdown in economic efficiency.
The results are worse than the analysis.
Most important events:
In the third quarter of the year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent per year, but by mid-year, it had grown.
The German economy in the third quarter grew by 0.5 per cent according to pre- and seasonal data.
The euro area economy and the European Union, between the Swedish and the euro area, grew by 0.2 per cent, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2 per cent annually.
The output of her 10-year debt is 28.45%.
The results of Italian and Spanish debt increases to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to feel like Rakousko, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The outputs in the Czech 10-year debt accounts for less than 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, the ECB is voting in favour of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In the Black Mountains they won 1:0 and celebrated the process for 200 million
The football representation of the most difficult task of the season!
In the Black Mountains and thanks to the great Czechs and the beautiful band of Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech football and with a large share of luck in the second time, won't miss the European champion again.
IHNED.cz has been monitoring the progress made in the detailed report.
Almost no explosion in the first half and a big part of luck in the second.
Czech representations and thanks to the domestic harvest in the end, the great Czech and the Croatian Yiračkov triumphed in the Black Mountains at 1:0 and praised the process of Europe's mystery.
The Black Horses were under pressure for the exact weapons of the Czech fleet until the second time.
Smolars became Damjanovic with the Vuchinic, who slept two big shots.
And thanks to the great Peter Czechs such a Czech representation or the next year will not miss the mystery of Europe, it will add 200 million kroner's ransom.
He's been playing a lot of football since the first few minutes.
Both teams were just trying to get together and play heavily around half-hats.
The pressure of domestic footballists and therefore did not arrive in the first half, long shields for the defence of the Czech defence were completely removed.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundreds of high school students have created a living shield around the nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed the next morning before the facility and then caused the deaths of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students of the University of Iran in Isfahan have been created in the afternoon near the Isfahan nuclear technology center in which the uranium is processed.
They make it so clear that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear programme with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that Iran did not stop using nuclear weapons as a whole.
A possible attack on the Iranian nuclear plant is being addressed in Israel.
The students prayed in the afternoon before entering the Espahan nuclear plant and then caused the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme, it would also be based on Israeli prints other than the Islamic medium's target of equipment in Natanzu, in which the uranium is growing.
The child's obese diet: breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with obesity, while over 9 percent of schools and obese are 5 percent of children.
Obesity children, however, come from most families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as shown by the current study.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns covered.
In obese children, for example, abortions are more common than in normal breast - feeding families.
The reduced meals had no more than 19 per cent of obeses for dinner prior to a study related to the global action called Obesita.
It is also not uncommon to be sports in pregnant families, which affects most families today - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents will find time at least once a week to be active.
A survey of 900 children
The study was conducted at the end of last year’s school year and was attended by 900 children from basic schools throughout the Czech Republic.
It was the second anniversary of the action of Obezita is no occasion to support the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
The project has so far involved more than 12 thousand schools from 4 to 8 classes.
The proper nutrition and delivery of the family is one of the determining factors that causes the number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the questions, for example, indicated that it was five times a day in the breakfast-night meal-night regimen, which is one of the basic assumptions of proper experience," says one of the results of the study.
No breakfast and dinner
The experts note that there are essential and relative details for healthy development, including the need for regular family breakfasts.
At the same time, only 23 percent of school families are hungry in Czech.
Most families eat themselves.
And the worst thing was to find out that in ten homes, it's not getting cold at all.
Breakfast is the basis for proper daily meals.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthful foods are more often consumed.
Almost every - no matter how much - drinks every day sweet lemonade (70 per cent).
The network regularly carries more than 40 per cent of the children interviewed, and the result was less than half - 15 per cent of their parents.
Get your food set up.
Another part of the study enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up their own food according to their own taste and opinion.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy living."
Among their favorite foods are many soft, fat and sweet foods.
"Alarming is particularly a large range of sweet lemonades," is the final report for the study.
For lunch as the main food, the testoline was firmly over the bush.
But the children actually didn't want to be hungry, and it's also low as much as fish and green food.
The threat to health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their diet if they get the right information.
"In the control group of the participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the world lecture, Obezita is not an accident, there has been, in a number of cases, a marked shift of preference towards the principles of healthy living," states the results of the project.
This was remarkable, for example, in the sweet lemonade, where more children would be given priority over common water.
Children have also more often been caught in the question of cattle and fish as the main food of the day and would be fed with sweet foods and vegetables.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, a firm profession.
In the opening article on how stylists are being taught, I felt so little that it was already a lot in the early hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Presentations of three field professions, the wearing of problem posts, and a seminar on how it goes on board.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course runs every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "crazy".
This time we went through with Director Allenko (in the course he's not the only guy) how to dress a woman who has no perfect balance.
And most of them are serious.
Someone's got a short cry, somebody else's gonna be a boy without proper hugs, and someone's gonna push over again.
The stylist must know how optically to change the wide shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've got the guys like Jennifer Lopez's type of woman, so larger breasts and legs and a tight dog, I'm going to get pretty excited and at the same time don't dress too attractive.
If, for example, the difference between the back and the sides is such that neither the shoes nor the pants are really sitting, then at least one such kiss will be paid off.
You're definitely not going to be sorry, because the perfectly falling clothes are not paid.
In a cup of peace you will feel much better than in someone who is constantly taking care of you, avoiding you, leaving you in the sand and like that.
A boy's attitude may also allow himself to wear clothing with haircuts, applets, boots, or packings.
Of course, such information and forms are a lot, so I'm glad I've had a whole week to confirm all the information in my head.
And at the same time, I'm afraid that because of the homework assignment, it's until now.
Each of the courses received a dedicated celebrity that has two outfits: day and night.
We need to take into account the current view, the fashion style of the person concerned and the type of position.
I'm going to "dress" Miranda Kerrow, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, for me personally, it is definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently collected about a hundred pounds (bert, please, in the rush of discovery), or young Selena Gomes.
We need to get out of the magazines or look online and print and then work the graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relation to graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page of the styling is also important.
The stylelist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product sites in newspapers (for specific tasks, for example trends in cables, cassettes, etc.).
He told us about this, the styleist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it's Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
On Saturday's presentation, three guests from the camp were shot at by the crew.
Stylist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that the fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a sleek stylist can work with one suit of clothes in a variety of ways.
Variability is key in this case.
So you should have such a moment (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) you can wear classics over the jeans and tricks like a plate, but you can also dress it on the naked body, wear a boat and wear it as a suit.
Or it's enough to shake hands or lips and then the whole look looks different.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start neglecting them," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we stick to all the lessons that we can combine with, why, why, even when we see something else in fashion magazines.
He's not even talking about the scans.
Thanks to Ben's photographers, I also know that the stylist must have been prepared a lot more variant of clothes than they're going to take pictures.
So in a fashion story that will have ten sides (then ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that it looks and works in combination with other pieces of lightly different from reality.
That's why we have to count the cost.
That image and style makes slightly to half the success, has confirmed us to Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which isn't exactly an amazing singer, but images and marketing from it made the world's old.
In Czech, access to the use of stylist services is still colder.
And the famous faces of her are easily considered to be essential (but that I can do something, as I look at it, is different).
And if someone's already leaving us to create a styling, then we have to calculate that with great probability, it's completely upstated (lower) size than it really does.
Then there is no need to google and find out if the bulldozer didn't say that this celebrate is contented/depleted and similar.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it's not enough for the stylists to focus on fashion and ability to deliver outfit.
In his work, he communicates with people who are dressed, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
You know, you can tell people, you can't stand up, you can't stand up to your opinion.
"If you are ordered by a manager to hit her with a knife and fill her with a beautiful shirt, then you can't shake her whole neck and say, "God, it's terrible."
"You can find at least some things that you admire and recommend for what they wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain a so-called "placock", or a bag on the plate.
It's the one you lock around the passport and you have all the properties you need.
In addition to clear things such as legs, caps, or lockers, there are also a silhouette (with a stylel help with focusing products such as cables or clasps), special clips that we cover behind the clothing, if larger (spins or other shoes are not available, cut off clothes), or scissors.
To not only listen but also try something practical, we learned how to properly spot the boots.
Even when you're focusing on the office, where there's the right surface, the floor could be damaged, then out.
And that's how we did it and we did it.
We can't even touch our legs so they don't hurt themselves.
So there's a real need for generosity.
Mario comforted me when he commended me for my creation without exception.
The so-called generosity isn't really my friend.
This is just a small piece of what we've heard about the second weekend extension of the course.
I'm starting to be as clear as ever as it's going to be for the professional level of styling as it really is for the rose seed to tell anyone who wants what it is.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs all over America.
Review
Initially, an empty ride is made because of the series of completely excessive misbehavior errors changes in the routine early morning road on the coast.
Ambice has achieved a significant measure, but it's not worth it if no one obviously wanted to do anything more.
A new piece with the title The Run was built before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that the flight race series Need for Speed again hit the top of the new direction and took from the game show as a game that would not have to be only in number in the event of the action race.
We were also aware of the impact of the installed passports in which the main harbor will come out of the car and run after them.
As in the NFS series, however, many are the result of a little different than we expected.
These are potentially sound arcade sports, but the whole is going to drop down a few of the remaining mistakes that occur in the series, mostly for several years.
So it's not even a mistake, but it's more obvious that there's a lack of understanding of the fate of the developers.
The hospitality starts very well.
You are mentioned in the story that Jack's main guard has certain personal problems and is offering to participate in an illegal race against America.
You will sit on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to reach New York as the first one.
The idea with you brings a few interesting things.
The track is divided into ten stages, and then more than ten races.
As a result, each race is on another track and the stages given are based on different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
Man doesn't even have a moment to feel that the game would still offer the same thing.
Some of the media are much more attractive in view, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a global thing.
But the ride above the desert, the southern landscape, or the high mountains in the snowy mountains makes visualally very pleasant.
In addition, the race has been interrupted by some non-typical element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you are trapped in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to sleep in the valley.
That's why they're pretty good for each other.
They're just a few types, but it's enough.
In the meantime, you try to predict the required number of opponents (mainly a classic race), then you get back to time (classical file with steps) and then you need to go with the only opponent.
You've been involved with this for a while, and the police, who still appreciate your efforts.
The news is passage outside the car.
It's only more about such interactive animations when Jack is mostly in front of some pig and you need to help him in this way so that at the right time, you can press the right button.
Nothing complicated.
It's surprising, though, that these puzzles are in the game much less than you would expect (in particular only three).
As a result, this is for the benefit of things, because this element has no chance of becoming boring, and in the context of the above mentioned above it is so arranged for individuals who stop the game.
The train model goes in the steps of the previous parts.
That means it's definitely not a girl today, but it can't be said to be a prisoner.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more active driving model is still quite good, as we could find better in competition.
Until then, it's all in plain order.
The problems, but they're beginning to appear after a while.
Unlike the model of the driving toy, it's not quite fine.
From this type of game we don't expect it to count complex deformations and cycles, but if you actually don't have at least the same noise as your car keeps, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you're driving hard or changing your car in the usual drive, you'll only take advantage of each other, but then in almost the same situation, your car ends in wild pirates.
Or even the same attack.
Thanks to the system of reboots, it's never gonna work out, but it's gonna break you down.
The restarts are solved so that if you relax or go away from the trail, it will take you back to the last catch point on the track.
Only five reboots are available in each race.
If you take it out, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's better to help if something doesn't happen before you can rely on them.
Sometimes, though, even the reboots do not help, it is clear that it is necessary to learn to remember this step of the race.
The big problem of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some attacks need to be designed in a specific way, or you won't be able to get into them soon.
Once again, you will be in the given "civil" vehicle always in the same configuration until you get there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially in situations where you see how between the two opposing cars will easily pass before you, while when you arrive there, there are already cars in such a condition that you have to drive or drive them.
It's one thing when you get to him because it's "counted" so that it always comes close to your nose.
The conquerors have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you find several places where you, again regardless of time, always face the same opponent at the same place.
The most important thing is to end the game at a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to get in front of you, apparently at any price.
When it comes to you, it will cause you to lose sight of the opposite cars, so at first, you may be sharing yourself with one another in a good way.
You can understand the purpose of making the game more stressful and adrenaline, but the performance is so obvious that it will quickly disappear from you.
And it's a shame, because even through a simple driving model is playing fun and places so busy that you can't always watch where you're going.
And it's basically one, whether it's about the concept with a dozen unique trajectories, sort of a race so that the offer doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You need to pay attention to gas pumps on the road because you can change the car right there, even though in most cases you will have enough of what you have right now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporters are suitable for urban areas, strong American boroughs on the same distance and exotic supermarkets on the technical eating, for example on clicks of mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand and challenge mode, which are the races in different locations that you know from history.
Here you get not only medals but also experience points into your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To get higher-level drivers, different items are discarded: start cars and end with background for profile.
This is also proposed again with the Autolog function, which in turn compares your results to other players and has other community functions.
One of the other difficult customers is the situation from the last race in history.
With your car you'll get to the tunnel of the subway (a building) where you're married in the dark next door (a building).
At the tachometer, the numbers are numbered between 150 and 200 km/h (budget) and in the back of the metro adjustment and not compromise you.
In writing, we'll probably have a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought about the game, or if the authors really have us so stupid.
The game's technical page is not extra, but at least the overall visual perception is very pleasant in most cases and in some cases even great.
It's so cold that in some more exciting moments, it's pretty tragic in some cases.
But this is especially true of a large number of participants when the film you've been filming is not worth anything at all.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a test question.
In an effort to please the largest scale of the younger audience has produced soundtrack from the category "every dog else", but it can be assumed that because of the music the game will probably not be bought by anyone like that.
The whole deal with Need for Speed: The Run is so very relaxing.
If the game were to produce all the remaining mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
But this is the way the game works.
The fun is certainly fine, but be prepared to make sure that you'll be hit by the force of the airport reflectors.
The UK's concerts will be held by the Samet Students

Welcome to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a history of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has clearly damaged the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little slow, calm and before all players become accustomed to their new role," she began her lecture at the Czech High School in the European Union, Milena Viceno.
As far as its motto, "Achievably and openly about Europe" was taken seriously, it was already shown in the first part of the lecture, when it was able to describe the individual EU bodies and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that it could find a number of speakers from the UK legal college.
Vice-President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye also welcomed the work of Vice-President:
"It was a criticism that it was not obvious that it was the other officer that he could not fulfill any role, and I have to say that everyone had a breath, that the role had been taken out of hand."
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicates best with them and has a clear vision where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question, "Who is this European Union? What phone number am I calling for?", then, as an important step towards the integration and greater transparency of EU policies against states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us cheeses.
Vicenna has also married an agency that the European Council has lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency noted the success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or arranged sums for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was then marked by a major negative that had caused much damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very full.
The term "frmol factor" was said to be not only the Presidency but also the next financial crisis that is being solved today.
Moreover, a new seven-year Union budget must be adopted, which is very complex because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a flexible and slow budget, which the sector will have a priority, which the countries will be supported more and less, is all on the agenda of the next meetings.
The majority also reminded the main speakers who came to Brussels, "On Europe understandablely".
"I really don't like sharp shorts, strange words, a glove that no one understands.
As the public understands that in Brussels there are really no red or yellow curvatures, bananas are very large, and that we really need to be banned from cigarettes."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to get more Czechs into the European institutions.
We are waiting for a multispeed Europe.
According to the majority, Czechs have a history of Eurosceptics and people who are more concerned with these negative than positive pages of the matter.
It also hates the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to it, there are many factors, such as the humility of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it has then increased the strength and cooperation of the four Visegradians.
"Believe me that when Poland and Hungary come after me and come closer to Slovakia, this Frenchman will say to me, "Hey, what are you doing there, what are your Visegrad's four?" and it doesn't matter.
In the future, according to Vice-Presidents, the Union looks forward mainly to the new strict rules for Member States' accounting policies.
As very real then, they consider the concept of double-speed, if not multiple-speed Europe, more than the new "European Federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the euro area."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"The first was said to cooperate only countries who want and those who don't want to stand back."
"These institutions will be more and will be a strong bilateral Europe," Vicen expects.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the implementation of the principles on which all topics affecting the Union as a whole are to be dealt with between all Member States, rather than just between eurozone countries.
Brand history:
The IBM Innovator starts its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a word that the IBM strategy would most clearly express, it would probably be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is considered very modern and, despite its establishment, it has been over a hundred years.
On the basis of this long-term commitment, the first head of the company, visionist Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already said that many of the world’s problems can be solved easily if people are willing to think.
His word "Think!" became so printed that the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine that began to appear in IBM in 1935).
It was also based on Watson’s finely built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve it even more," noted Samuel J. Palmsano's current manager for the year.
Processed System
In the three-year years, Watson contributed to the care of his employees like Băa business in Czech - people from IBM had as one of the first US employees a paid salary, insurance from employees plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system to compensate the best buyers and sellers.
Also developed is the long-term IBM and customer relationship.
Since the beginning, the company has been a genius in the production of talents - as one of the first world companies to eliminate any discrimination, so she could choose.
In accordance with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will raise a woman - Virginia Romaetti in the head of IBM next year.
This in IBM has lasted for thirty years, and the position of the sales, marketing and strategy leaders has remained.
In recent years IBM has made so-called jams, on-line brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations exist.
It's not surprising that there's enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institute with a good name
A strong business position ensures its strong internal and external images.
"Economics Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter said:
"IIBM is not a technological firm, but a company that helps solve business problems for technology," George Colony added to Forrester Research's consulting company.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market is equal.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is seen in the United States for its logo in a family - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world for a hundred years.
It is obviously the most outstanding technology company - develop hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from servers by nanotechnology.
She holds most patents from all American technology companies and five of her employees have won Nobel Prize.
Its findings include banknotes, payment cards, financial swaps, black code or diskettes.
IBM's cost of 220 billion dollars this year became the second largest technology company based on market capitalisation (the first is Apple) when Microsoft first appeared in 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations have been tested by customers and times - IBM has not, for example, indicated a link to its own OS/2 operating system, on-line Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computer.
"If your business is on the move ahead, you can't emotionally jump back to the past," says Samuel J. Palmsano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave it.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
In the IBM markets, the largest share of services is that of software and hardware.
At the same time in 1990 he was more than half the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold some profitable assets at $15 billion, while investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008 when the new financial crisis first hit the world.
IBM is one of his first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is currently facing an unaffected crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the share price of IBM has risen by 120 per cent, the net profit of the company has increased continuously.
IBM's company password is to change everything, just not its values.
That is why it can be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM's History: From the series series after the flight to the sky
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulation Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted until 1924 — originally a sign used for branch offices in Canada and South America.
On the basis of the later IBM, she gave a fuse to four companies whose history dates back to the 18th century.
They own technology as they should say "fucking" and then the hours marked by the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the company's supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired the chief of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then represented IBM-founders - in Watson's opinions, an inexhaustible company culture and identity has already been established.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name says, started with the production and sale of all possible machinery for business - from the meat and cheese growers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, he doubled his business to nine million dollars and began expanding the company's expansion to all the worlds.
Watson was so infamous for the company that after almost four decades in the Chef Cross, he shot his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its guidance IBM began to work on developing artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA direct the flights to the universe - to Mercur, Saturn and in 1969 the famous year of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "petch" that came up with the computer standard at that time, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the production of computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to pay full attention to advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy that has been paying for IBM in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, "speech planets".
Its aim is to make the use of technology smart in the long run even in unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in the right or the right of the city.
In the area of trade, IBM recently launched the "Smart Commerce" platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in Turkey.
It was founded in the former Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, there is also a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and is also a research team of the world's voting levels.
Director of an Unfaithful Wife:
Iveto, leave it alone, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richter (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtár (53) became not only the protection of Ivety Bartoshev (45), but also a honeybee, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the red dream and return home.
Just waiting for an inconsistencies and setting clear rules for the rest of her life.
"The Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained the Richter.
When Darina Richter gave Bartosh's asylum in her home in summer, she apparently didn't see how her marriage ended.
Although Iveta was moving away from Russia for 30 days, Pepa didn't leave the song.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina refused, her husband’s attitude softened, and she even gave him a kiss forever.
The hunter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Richter and Bartosh were to divorce once, he'll not be allowed to wait at home for his wife's hand.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will touch him."
"It does, however, come not as my beloved old-fashioned island, but as a person with whom I have a certain relationship," Reuters said, saying that she has abandoned her husband and only remains in mutual subjection.
Joseph's being locked up by Darina's back door, it's still okay.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I'll be with Iveto and I won't change it."
"The husband continued his paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The firm goes on, I care about repairs, the garden, property, I buy."
"We're having a whole normal time with Darwin, even though we don't share the lies together," said Blesk Richter.
If Richard also finds new love, he won't defend her first.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with and if he's got a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Ivety and take all responsibility for myself," Josef concluded.
The worst female abuses: Are they affecting you?
When you ask men if they can name some typical female abuses, it's all right to one is very ready to get rid of the arm.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following order, where there are several women's crimes that make men capable of pumping blood into the lungs?
Purchase
Does your second half tell you that you're dependent on buying?
Do you have to buy at least one hat a week?
Do you buy love and together in the woods?
Then in your case, you can talk about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that they should have at least a little bit of their shopping cart.
But tell me, who would just go through the clothes trades, look for yourself well-fashioned surfaces, and then all of them (ideally in different colour performances) are tested in the cabin?
Although for most women it's a shopping dog, for men it can become a pretty good dog.
Just remember how many times you've told yourself that he'd rather wait for you before he came in...
Unsatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start dancing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't you remember this news?
That's right?
Then you belong to the women who are content with what they look like.
Not that you should stop worrying about yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners continue to complain about their views.
Stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this pregnancy, the more vulnerable women are.
First place order and purity
It's like an endless circle.
The windows are closed, wetting, wetting, wetting, wetting, wetting out - and it's at least twice a week.
You're telling your partners that he was wearing a spinal cord on a clean bed, that the kids had cut off the cut out of the wall and had to pay off the broken living wall, with which you had done so much work?
If you're suffering with this "apace", try to realize that nothing has to be overrun and order and purity should definitely not be in the family's first place.
This harmless touch of cleanliness can threaten your relationship with each other and your family life.
Dizziness
"You used coach go to the bone."
"Are you gonna take your old shoes tomorrow too?"
"The dark morning doesn't fall on the ground."
If you get to your partner several times a day, you know you can drive him in a reliable manner.
Of course you don't think it's bad, you want to make it all right.
Maybe if the men knew that, women wouldn't have to get into them so much...
Talk, hold
For some women there are also personal conversations, drugs, but even harassment and coercion.
Women are focused on relationships, and they are happy to discuss things like who, where, with whom, and why.
Almost every one of us is going to release a little harmless drop or a tie over there.
Hands on the heart, it's almost all women.
On the other hand, they are the deafest of the deaf, who are happy and often tired, almost everyone is opposed and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially in the context of a female working group.
Jägr and Voráček helped the supporters to win Philadelphia
Hoke's attacker Jaromír Jágr shared in the morning attack of NHL with two supporters on the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the ground of Carolina and is again in front of the production of Czech players in competition.
In both cases Claude Giraux, a nine-year-old star who added another play and was reported to be the best player in the game.
Two assistants in the game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jacob Voráček.
Jögre, after beating sea reporters, claimed that Girox had predicted a big night.
"I told him before I sang it, he gave a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"When you feel this way," explained Jágr, after his action Giroux gave his head out of the first Flyers shooting.
A while later, he had a second suit for the Czech team.
The Vorček fought for the Huricanes Cotouč branch and presented it among the circles running by Max Talbot.
The second before the first stop was reduced in the weakened domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part belonged again to the Flyers.
Especially Girox.
After working with Jagre, he shot a third head, and after his shooting, he turned the race into the fourth bank of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's probably among the best three," Jágr assessed his center.
"I would never think that at the end of my career I would be playing hockeys like him."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play on it."
"All those years in NHL my co-players have tried to play on me, now it's turning," added Jágr.
Carolin's gun still made the play, the Tooma Rutu, and the Dwyer again, who passed out of the criminal shooting, got to a different branch.
Another complication, but he didn't let Matt Read, who finished counting two to one.
"He's been very busy in our Pronger song."
"Shut up the box, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner."
"I've tried to meet him and I'm glad it came out," he wrote the last branch of the stock market from his view of Voráček.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win a fight against Buffalo, and in the second third he withdrew due to injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens also lost double-bank leadership and lost after the criminal blast at 2:3.
One of them didn't change Tomáš Plekenec.
The home trainer more than the lost points hated the wide bottom line, with only five runners winning the game.
"It's bad."
"We spent the escape with only one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it soon, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We couldn't afford it."
"We were supposed to simplify the game more, get the ball out of our dog."
We had mesers," added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Czech banker Ondréj Pavelec added thirty Winnipeg matches to win 5:2 on Tampou Bay.
About the gates of Jets, who broke the five-step series of prohers, were divided into five different shooters.
How the Prices of Interests have developed since 1989
By 1989 there were only five national travel offices in Czechoslovakia: Čedek, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time were selling in the woody majority only entry into the country of the socialist block, as travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists thus traveled by sea to the NDR (Germany Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (The Black Sea Court), Bulgaria, Romania (both the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime was bound to the West and the Czech tourists' roads to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of socialism was that it was not possible for the citizens of the socialist block (e.g. the Czechs) to travel individually, even within the socialist countries.
If the citizens of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or to the Soviet Union, they needed a letter from that country, otherwise there was no individual road.
Travel agencies at that time also offered a ride to the West, but it was necessary to stand up to the front during the night with a spare or in the travel office "well known".
However, it wasn't won.
The so-called dividend, which was a condition for the West road, was not made "politically independent people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not free of exchange currency, so without a dividend, it was not possible to obtain financial resources (the western currency) on the west road.
Far away, however, the Czechs carried a permit in Turkey, resulting in a large number of chats and chats that Czechs have made and this custom survives to this day.
The Czech travel has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
As long as 1989 was allowed in NDR or Bulgaria as our maximum, the troops spent Czechs abroad 4.5 million in countries around the world.
The vast paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely by 1989, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 90th century, visa obligations were abolished in neighboring Western European countries, which began with a large wave of short-term visits to the former Soviet Union or Germany.
The Czechs couldn't travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to see them there for at least a minute.
For example, in Paris, Czechs slept in parks because our current incomes did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
The typical route of the Czechs was at this time to drive their own food, condoms, salts, etc. to heal.
Another important moment was the introduction of a free changeable Czech crown, which our tourists could finally buy a Western currency for many decades.
However, our standard of living and the average wages rose, which was released around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, travel offices began regularly since 1997 to prepare their charter flights, which resulted in an incredible decline in the number of flights due to the possibility of using multiple discounts compared with the past.
By the end of the 1990 ’ s, the Czechs had virtually all the successful countries in the world, except the United States, which continued to make our journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the revolutionary journey took place in the year 2000, when thanks to the great demand from the Czech Republic, the historical first direct charter year to exotics, it was in Thailand.
From this year on each year, Czech tourists travel directly to warm countries, the annual winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to the 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic country is currently visiting some 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa for Czech tourists was cancelled and our country was definitely organized among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their foreign permits (50.3%) in 2008 and the first ones in the history lost one foreign permit including the cost of more than 15 thousand residences.
The Valiant Group is going to find the president again, but it's dangerous
For about five months, the Czech football is no president and it is dangerous that Ivan Haška's presence in the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known after any other extraordinary wave resort which takes place on Thursday in Nymburc.
However, there is still no agreement under which a voluntary order will be made.
Without it, she will not even vote for which of the three candidates will be elected.
I'm interested in bringing the Czech photo to Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Haszek refused to function in June, and when he left, he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that would lead to a football in the future.
Only in the mountains after Hasko's photobal has come back to travel between the two wedding rooms that cannot match the common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when the new President was to be elected.
The delegates to the National House in Prague in Smichova sat mostly, as the meeting remained blocked and not only about the way the vote was done.
It has not even been agreed who has the right to vote in a group itself - whether only statutory representatives or officials have full power.
In this single paragraph, a partial agreement has taken place since then, which has also helped to recommend the State and law Statute, which provides that full power cannot be represented.
But the spores still give you about the election order.
If you have made it clear that neither the Executive Committee nor the Executive Committee has made any difference in the course of their meetings, whether it is right or wrong.
The view of the option of choice has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd wheel in order to exclude the possibility of a fall?
"The argument is whether to act in accordance with the conditions or to find another model," said one of the three presidents of the FAČR Dušan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
According to the estimates of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have a larger percentage of support in the chamber will win the lower bidder.
It must be clearly willing to go to the summit to win a candidate who will get a higher percentage of votes from both rooms.
And the Czech side passes the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the transfer in this percentage calculation.
"Because it would then leave the meaning of two previous cars, it would completely obliterate the two-way concept," explains the idea of the freedom of the Navy, which would be the best way to stay and vote according to the conditions.
In some cases, he agrees surprisingly with Tomáš Paclík, although it is estimated that the conditions of the election will depend on all the candidates of Pelt.
"I swear to love him as much as I can."
"In order not to think of any ridiculous nonsense as in the past wave collection," said owner Victoria Plzeň, who is the first candidate and, in his statement, was particularly opposed to Pelt.
The sheet remains optimistic.
In Nymburg, according to him, the new president will know and believe that candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All of us are very comfortable today's national team procedure on Europe's mission."
"The football will also be happy again, it will be more willing to cooperate," said an apple worker, who has from all three of the greatest experience with football management at both the professional and regional level.
Rachel's more stable.
"I trust the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very solved."
"It's not between the people of Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the rules to their purpose."
"This can cause the wall of the hall to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that it's a healthy mind," said Rachel.
There's not much time left for the agreement on all sides.
Some meetings were to be played directly in the Black Mountains, but those who would think the football general would be totally complete in the game.
The aircraft special in which they were to travel to Podgorica along with other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, who did not fly from Prague due to technical disturbances in the morning, looking for a replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee, to deliver the cargo transport.
Finally, a decision-making meeting at the ministerial level may be reached in the middle.
Minister of School, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to accept the dissolved parties within the strongest sports association in the country to the agreement.
In the game this is a lot: state funding, football reliability, and also a ČSTV wave gathering, which will solve new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazky.
He's going to fight the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football team had seen Tomáš Paclík in front of an international volleyball club, he would have completed all his presentations on the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor would he have been involved in the struggle for a top function.
"If there's a quality adapter, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to vote."
"But no one has been able to find such a thing for the present situation," said ČTK Paclík.
In the struggle with Miroslav Pelto and Jindřich Rajchlem's wife Paclík motivated to try to get into the path to the head of the FAČR.
Paklik also stresses that in the event of his victory, the President would only remain until 2013, when he is on the programme with a proper wave range.
As a result, he would like to see an experienced and spy manager who is not too sleepy with a football game.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with the Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this view," he said.
Paclik's relationship with the President of the Plzeń National Football Union, Roman Berbrem, is now at the forefront of Pacli, a man with a controversial story, known in the background as a powerful lobbyist, has the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the wave fair.
For Paclika it's so unacceptable that Pelta becomes president.
"If he wins, he's preserving his current position, and nothing in the football is going ahead."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, which is a reliable businessman, it would not benefit the football anymore," Paclík declared.
It also argues that Pelt's name was filed in the polls during the investigation of the corrupt case, from which Pelta was released without a penalty.
"I don't know how much prestige the football would have brought to Pelt's victory."
"And as we would have appeared in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who but has already taken a look at his previous product that would "sell a swimming club if Pelta became president".
In the event that Paclík would triumph in the fourth election, however, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelto.
He also sees another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclík has supported before the funeral of the funeral bell, which ended with the wedding.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I'd go after."
"My great abilities."
"I'd be able to imagine him as the head of a representative."
"But the manager could not run an association."
"I also don't have a nose where I can't do it," Paclík, who, in September, raised a lot of attention by calling the decision-making commission on behalf of Man Macle, who rewarded Dagmar Damk.
Paklik says he'd be in charge of the association.
It appeals to its ability to manage private companies, as well as to the Chief Plzni since last year, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Prime Minister's league triumph.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to his particular culture."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which should have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeals commissions, which is leading to unpleasant situations," Paclík said, who ignores his antipathy, for example, to the partner chief Daniel Kretínski.
One of the priorities would also be to consider the implementation of the FAČR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help to attract more money from lottery taxes in the political spheres.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should commit."
"When it comes to gambling, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but at least they have to say where money goes," he noted.
As a competitor now, Paclík doesn't even take his relationship with the crying club, he himself claims that the president of the FAČR should be "foreign".
It's full again with Jablonce, Rachel with the Persian Duke.
"It's not ideal."
"I can't see, but I didn't mean to transfer my shares to the swimming club and in a year and a half back there," Paclík said.
Full promised new FAČR status that would exclude the optional bed
Two days before the wave, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the case of a choice, the FAČR would have new positions that would definitely eliminate disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonek official is optimistic before the fourth meeting in Nymburce and believes that the pre-war will clearly mark the success of today's football representation.
Plenta has already promised that the right to represent and obtain funding is to be concentrated in the case of a choice.
He decided to go to the meeting before the last wave, so that his two-month rest could take place so that his ideas on the control of the football would be discussed and presented in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been taking photos for a long time and are expecting the president to know on Thursday."
"It feels like it's the highest time for an association to lead," said a man who is primarily associated with the apple club, but who spent several years in Sparta and the executive committee.
And that's why he thinks he's got enough experience so he can run a Czech football.
It is believed that, in the current problems with volleyball, it is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of the government of Ivan Haška.
"Thanks to the Red Wall House, the positions that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If there were no different interpretations, we should have been in the chair since the session," Pelta warned.
The right to review the most important document of the civil society was regarded as a pledge to delegates.
"If I become president, I'll take it as my personal mission and I'm willing to assume my personal responsibility if I don't do it."
"It's a basic thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He's trying not to fight his enemies.
He had already announced that he would be able to cooperate with Jindřich Raichl, who recognises him for his legal education, and he well knows that his pro-indication would be his first vice president.
He did not even oppose Tomás Paclík, who, on the other hand, left the dry night on Pelt.
"The football moves something over a year, has already achieved some success."
"But his attacks were in vain, and many people in the way of a voluntary campaign. "
"And so many of them now doubt his real character," he said to the opponent's address Pelta, who, for the first time remains faithful to the proclamation that he has already announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competition to the next representative.
That should be an Explanatory Fotball Screen.
"And I would also try to end all the cases starting with the Bohemian case or the appeals of the late corruption scandal."
"Now I would return to meeting with the private and state sector to ensure that we have enough money for the entire football," said the Czech candidate six hundred years ago.
He also promised that his coming to the head of the football wouldn't mean any personal cleaning.
"I should first meet with full-time employees," he pointed out to Strahov, where a long-term government has become an understandable nervous system.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios, which are being held by a wave of mobs, they believe that they will not go to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If it's the only fight I'll be able to fight in the third wheel, then we'll be able to move through it."
"The football needs credibility, and it's just that it will finally have its leader back," Pelta remains two days ago, possibly the day he decided his career was optimistic.
Rachel promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him.
If the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic were to be elected by Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl on Thursday, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rachel also promises that she will work hard in the case of her choice.
He wishes to make the system changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football field.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into the football game and continue the work that President Ivan Hasek started.
"As president, I would like to fight the football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance photo by youth."
"But I don't say I'd do anything by myself," said Rachel in a talk for the Czechs.
"I am a team player and I want to divide competences in the Executive Committee so that each of the members has a certain area."
"And I'm going to hand over the hard tasks to take a picture of love step forward in each of this segment."
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticising the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football team, he had previously considered that he would not be running again.
"I know I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me who will keep staring at me under my feet and questioning every step of my step," he explained why he was tired.
"Many people told me that I shouldn't give it up because they'd give it to others."
"It's a trust that I can't just guess," he said.
It motivates him to continue in the work he started with Hashk.
"For the two years, a great deal of work has been done, and I don't want to miss it now."
"There are initiated processes that will have a call for up to a few years, and I would not like someone to stop them," he said with concern that in the case of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelty, she might be able to return to the time before Haskek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the thing that Mirek Pelta doesn't believe."
"There are first-hand people for him who would make a football so he would be only released for those."
"I can read a lot of things, but certainly not that I'm a stranger."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because then they'll all have a good time and not just you," noted Rachel.
He's saying he'd only be the Czech president.
"Even if some people try to insist on it, I'm going to make a maximum for Morawa."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would divide into the Czech and Moravia parts whose winners would go to the first league."
"It wouldn't be the same when there are only three marine cells in the lake, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
Since the head of the Plenary Club, Tomáš Paclík, was also involved in the war with the president, Rachel did not hesitate to give up her chance to make a choice.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me for his position and sees clear success for me," said Rachel, who for her success views the saving of tens of millions of crowns on unfathomable contracts, the conclusion of television contracts and the negotiation of lottery law.
On the other hand, he's giving himself up to the agreement that the competition is not going to be a one-way deal.
As far as Pelt is concerned, he is "dequately qualified to return to the Czech football team", another of Paclika's opponents is considered to be a strong candidate who has the football to offer.
"No one can doubt that Plzna took a great job this year."
"If he had been elected, he might have continued in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not necessarily change the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it in his own favor," the values of the rival of Rachel.
The most beautiful European pools
Mobular Switch
Julia Stanek
From the Ufona view, a swimming pool in Budapest: Anyone who travels to Europe can experience his modern surprise - and after a city or travel visit, let his warm feet rest in hot lava.
The book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder appeared in a sudden one and a half years on the public road, she had no reason to miss her due diligence: her lungs.
A sign on the water, due to the heights of the artists made of copper, sailed against the marble pupti (the setting up of a small nested boy, a child (with wings)) waiting on it at the bottom of the pool and admires the carefully restored secessary floor.
If a shipman liked her, she took her to her secretary in the kitchen with remarkable details about how the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 ships have studied this way the historical architecture of Meder and now represents it in its right-hand book "Badefrident (Badefreuden from Shopping) ": People's Flood in Munich, the historic Palace of Ships in Schwarwald, "Hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries hosted her "Cesta for the most common salmon in Central Europe": According to Germany, Rakouska and Switzerland, she visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46th year of Germany is a truly enthusiastic shipping culture.
With sports it's a lot of fun, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
It is only with regard to the fact that falsifiers have to rest with blue caps and chlorine, while health-care runners can breathe the smell of cold forests or listen to the happy lighting of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why it must always be so funny," said Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful flowers."
The water floor doubles the architecture
The explosion in the Scottish pool and essential oil for sauna - the cause of the weather is so great that it concerns all the meanings, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the depositors try, they can be a real trap for the eyes: "The place of the floor is a man in a glass of water."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All optically doubles: high clasps, wooden cacholes, jumpy pears.
The small-format picture "Badefreuden (Buddy of Shopping)" offers 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural events of the historical world wellness - it stimulates, but above all, the desire to jump into the blue.
An outstanding example was revealed by the vessel collector Mrs. Meder on his flight to Hungary.
According to excellent medical facilities such as the 100-year-old Szecheny in Budapest, she found water containing showeres in the original spas in Miskolc-Tapolca and thermal bathrooms filled with alkaline water and located in the building form of coffee (Varoso Termáfürdö in Jasberén).
On the other hand, there are many large-scale swimming pools under the sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has from the Curiosian resort all over the city, he can look at the snow-covered in St. Anton's outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the parlours there is a window from which he can watch the walk on the ski lift.
The most remarkable design of the pool is expected to be in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just arrived in Alpach.
Out of the three tops of the open fields in the winter, the couple stand while in the back of Ötztala mountain climbs to heaven.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not every swimming pool picker Mrs. Meder pach chlorine to the floor.
Many thermal baths are to be felt after the sire, in the spasy Árpáds in Hungarian Bequessabé, it's a warm oil to the point that a person almost believes he's got into the healing baths.
The winds come from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen sulphite, which is almost black and whose deposits are inflated on the skin, when only a person enters the pool - some special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also one of the places where she was looking for beautiful lasers: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioning laser Luhačovice, she found it on a closed ground.
In 1902 the architect Dusan Jurkovic was proposed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked out of the windows of the red-white-white-green secessary building, she saw how possible the flow between the beds would be widened.
The scene was set against this in the beautiful flower shop in Schwarwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
They already have three stages of construction; man can discover not only the New Testament elements that come from the time of his appearance in 1844, but also the Maurice Sea in the style of Alhambra, which was connected in about 1900.
Since the summer of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite place of the pools of Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she comes from Schwarwald.
"It's already some performance, to connect so diverse building blocks into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, the heating in the thermal pool is obviously a real deal.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving his business with agricultural resources?
According to information, SPIEBEL-ONLINE entrusted Josef Ackermann to the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
Then, in January, the head of the group wants to produce results.
Hamburg
It is clear to the public that 84% of the Germans believe that it is unacceptable for banks to be speculative of agricultural resources such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the questioned even require Deutsche Bank and the other credit institutions to emerge from this trade because the world's poorest problems are widening.
This is the result of Forsa's investigation of consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is about the report that Footwatch presented in half of October.
In it, author Harald Schumann points out that the stocks in global comedian boroughs are therefore not compatible with the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is targeted specifically against the chief Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley do the same.
For the first time, comedy chains were designed to ensure price training for traders.
In the meantime, most experts agree that the participants in the capital market are interested in high-risk trades in response to tenders and requests - and in the light of the most expensive gains.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Akermann’s criticism: He promised that he would check out the profits and said that no trade "was needed to be a good message from Deutsche Bank in cash".
According to the information, SPIEBEL Online controls the International Working Group on Footwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the controls must be closed, and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation to be submitted.
At the end of the winter, bank representatives want to report the consequences.
Finally, the reduction of trade in comedites or even total rejection could be achieved.
Ackermann works by himself on his image.
The Head of the Foodwatch Thilo Body welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The meeting on growing food prices shows particularly sharp how regardless of the banks today, it is harmful to the general interest."
Ackermann as the highest banking lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must delete from its portfolio all the items in which cash is used for food stamps," Bode said.
"Lostfully, does Mr. Ackermann care about the cold of the people who suffer or about the history of Deutsche Bank?"
Ackermann's view is at first seen as surprising, but it is clear that a group head would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the event would not go to the Board of Auditors unless it was planned.
By turning away from a competitive gambling speculation, he could improve his image.
And you don't have to worry about the possible loss - you should deal with it at the end of his life.
Any other investment in raw materials would have been declared
Footwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
Already more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institute of Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven percent of it claims to be legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food prices.
Many banks would also have personal consequences if they were to find out that their bank was involved in such transactions: Each other would, as a result of the investigation, disclose all the investments in which money is involved in speculating raw materials.
43 per cent would warn known before such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that he would think about his account being charged and go to another institution.
The 21st - Century House in Vienna
Move to Wastebin
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with tops, falls and happy endem: The Rakouska Pavilon from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 received prices, became a Vidni museum, remained empty and abandoned.
Now they're reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is heated for modern holiday architecture, for clear forms, painted halls, brave mixes and new building materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Raquesian Pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's Pavilon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its ease and highly moving construction of steel and glass.
The state is now dedicated to the mill of contemporary architecture.
He praised the architect so much that he also built the Pavilon Rakouska for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-pound BMW plus as the key to the next building in Munich at the end of 1973, he celebrated internationally.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by the world after the exhibition, it was located in the Swiss Garten in the Südbahnhof (South coast), rebuilt and opened the 20th century Museum in 1962 - it was called the "House of the 20th Century".
But for the museum, there was no space or technique - there were no walls to shut down the artistic exhibits, no air-conditioning.
However, it was used until the current art was expected in the Vienna new stage.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and captures more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the Pavilon, now called "House 21st century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Modern Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum of Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, is the first exhibition - a happy goal in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Rakuus Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical art with a significant career, i.e. in a young krasobrusr, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the modern Museum of Salzburg, made extensive reconstruction in politics and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and determined use.
In addition to contemporary art, the work of Fritze Wotruby's sugar should be presented with the same offer, the coffee and bookshop should be set up, and the office building should be built.
Close inspection, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was an ideal combination.
Not only did Joseph Olbrich successfully rebuild and expand the sequencing building in Vienna and win the competition, but in Schwanzer he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilon was "the most important place" for him, where he was "nearly every weekend" watching exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building that had already been lost when he moved to Vienna and changed the use of it for its advantages and ease.
At the present reconstruction there were far greater problems: the building was "capapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass panes has been replaced, used by the glass-coated fibres of an insulation glass and the glass glass is replaced by a special safety layer.
Chlorinated bridge-peckers were strengthened or altered, and asbestos-filled roofs were repaired.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street, there is a light to the entrance of the museum - almost a new building, but still a highlight of the Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance doors were kept, the building was built in an old red-colored red-ton.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And that's all for the exact consideration of the memory office and the low budget.
"There must have been a lot of material that was good and cheap and also liked the memory office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the split floor of the subterranean.
Through all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and air-conditioned.
It was hard before it was with a pavilion, "who came from Brussels," said recently Krischanitz, typical "Drop-in-the-City-History".
Such architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "be aware of yourself".
In this case, however, the 21st century is not a home in an unmatched place, as urban success has come to an end: in the vicinity of Schweizer Garten creates a completely new "City Square in the Main Market" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy chance: By the 21st century, he could have received support from another Krishnantz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporåre Kunsthalle and how he heard, one with a neighboring town in Schweizer Garten.
Draha is planning a package for the winter crisis in the millions
Draja has launched a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It's gonna be a million.
In the fight against winter accidents caused by train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than EUR 70 million this year, according to news reports.
The "Bild" news brought forward a message calling for an internal group plan to be counted first by 2015 with investments of around EUR 300 million.
He should be helped to make better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
A total of 16,000 persons are scheduled to remove snow from railway equipment and premises, except for the number of internal and external staff.
The aim is to free the station to start the operation and 90 per cent to carry out the necessary movements within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Chief of Drah Rüdiger Grube, after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives in front of train accidents and delays during the summer.
In the past winter, she had serious problems in personal affairs, as she also had lack of reserves under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, a number of new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Joint Railway Authority for years.
In addition, delay is allowed for ICE train repair
The road has also not been able to allow ICE trains to be more often controlled when one ICE train arrived at the main port of Cologne for the destruction of the equipment.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar loan in the USA
After the divorce by Chief Joseph Ackermannna comes to the new trampoths in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As with the problems at home, Deutsche Bank has not had enough work in the past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million in one balance sheet ($106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage letters.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a number of large banks that the corporate banks have made false promises to buy financial products; the risk has probably decreased.
Such papers have been lost during the crisis significantly at the expense of banks and destroyed them.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the subject without the need to bring the parties to court," said the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by making an agreement.
It also pays for the Citigroup, which was committed to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the honesty of both financial institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for corporate banks in the United States and assists banks to protect customer reviews.
The NCUA is trying to get revenge for its billions of damages.
Now the final equations are their first type.
The regulator also applied to other banks and complained to JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
In suspicious hypothetical lists, one is called Mortgage-backed Securitys.
They're based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bublin broke out around property in 2007, a number of financial companies were convicted.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its opinion.
Even though it happened a few years ago, it's now flashing at banks in the midst of heavy wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous complaints in order to achieve adjustments or make mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) filed the largest complaint.
There are 18 international banks that two U.S. finance agents living in property owned by Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions amounting to about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, where there is an increase of approximately $14.2 billion in total sales from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority requires the French Constitution to respond to "substantial losses" without specifying a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as irreparable and declared he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT subnet IBM.
From March, he bought the stock at a value of more than $10 billion.
So far, significant American investor Warren Buffett has always announced that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term company development will only be allowed to predict problems.
However, he has now read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand in a long time that IBM offers services above all and approves computer systems for the IT division of other companies.
Warren Buffetta's investment is based in the financial world for comparison to the rite.
As a result, it can be called the mother's IT IBM horn now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett sold it at the U.S. C.C.B.C.A.A.A.A.A.A. that he had purchased from March for IBM at $10.7 billion.
His Investment Holding Berkshire Hataway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett says IBM hasn't known anything about his engagement yet.
He commended the management that he had tried for the economic crisis, even for the good results.
"You did a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been sitting on the LLC services for a long time as it is the operation of accounting centres.
More than 100-year-old computer contractors also offer software and advice and executive computers for companies.
Buffett's a tech firm is more likely to escape until today.
He claims that he only invests in businesses whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett sold it on a cost-effective railway, on a masim or on a production machine.
His Holding Berkshire Hataway owns about 80 own subsidiaries also participated in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old master took over a small textile company in Berkshire Hataway and built with it one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Still, his way of life is modest.
That's why for many investors around the world, it's a cultural institution.
His almost wrong sense of making money brought him a preview of "Omaha's Orakel."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's share rose by one percent before the start of the storm.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a total price of over 220 billion dollars and is awarded with Apple and Microsoft for the world's most valuable technology companies.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to go.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The threat is massive
After the discovery of "Bunks in Zwickau" Turkish media suspects the German legal state.
News is even talking about "blood ideology", which is now relived.
There were always eight small businessmen from the Turkish origin and one river in the years 2000 to 2006 who had a fairly extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany, this report has been answered with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German Turks, fear was coming back after the death of a long time: From the war attacks in Möln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable violence with a legitimate extremist background.
That there was a xenophobic in Germany, though there was no doubt about it.
However, the legally discovered extremistic network has been reducing the size of which it has long been unable to observe.
"Does Blood Resurrected Ideologies?" said the titles of the online edition of the Turkish news "Haberturk".
In contrast, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the defendants should be a secret police agent for the protection of the constitutions and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical base.
Turkey's citizens of Germany responded positively: She mentioned the weekend of protesting against Brandenburg's defense of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish citizen in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish policies, mentioned the 14th anniversary of the German-Turkey Convention.
In happy colors, a common life was staged as a success.
As a lie here, several Turkish media reports: "Germany's Day to the Decade" is a post of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the "Hurrijet" for Germany will not take place in order to avoid this mental connection.
"It's starting to hang up," says the title of the column from Ahmeta Kulaci.
He stressed that the people who paid taxes and their work had been murdered had made an important contribution to the return of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in the German online forums of police procedures and its late success in patroling.
Why did the German authorities not seem to have been able to find out much earlier that after suspected patrols in the right extremes, the authors were surprised.
In this way, many believe that the retortically ready to use radical means: "If the work continues to be done on the surface, the passengers will not be forced to do anything but their own defence and arms."
"It'll be probably the best self-defense."
"The quality of the explanation and adaptation of the distortion of the whole network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany," says "Selen."
What it means, if internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the attacks in Möln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the burning room in Solingen is a deep hole in German and Turkish memories.
Because no other event has shown the living Turks more clearly that there is a massive threat and the Germans that lack of faith and rejection can lead to legal violence.
However, the attacks made Turkey's side feel closer to each other.
Do not repeat mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the German policy was mainly criticised after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Möln who survived.
After the summer attack in Solingen sent a friendly telegram to the Turkish state president, but he left to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkelem - Kinkel in his statement, and then calculated what payments the Turkishs had received.
Just like the value of a person is measured according to the height of his tax.
The current media report once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the present state-law arrangement is deep.
According to the strong interpretation and new assessment of extreme terrorism in Germany, this is currently demanding open words.
Skandal Bank in the Curry Lake
The best European bank has no seat in Italy or France, probably in Switzerland.
The U.S. has been suffering from a financial crisis for almost a billion years, and from that time onward, it has been cut off from one crisis to another.
Now it's got some German to compare.
So Axel Weber certainly didn't think of it.
After his partial departure from the leadership of the Joint Bank, it became known in July that 2013 would be at almost the same spectacular new employment: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, commended Switzerland for its beauty and for its new solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The U.S. made it work."
"I'm happy to work with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in the summer that everything would be completely different.
A dealer from the UK in London spent all the banking security systems and lost about EUR 1.7 billion.
Mr. Oswald Grübel, not only a known banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the U.S. Board of Directors has also been on fire since then - and all ask: When will Axel Weber finally come?
I've been aware that Weber's bank has been working since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Governing Council will take over in May, not first in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
For Axela Weber, it's gonna be tough.
He's not a banker, he's a more economic professor and an emission banker, and he'd certainly need a long time to work.
Then we will assume responsibility for the Bank's strategy, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title "Banca of Europe's biggest scandals"
Because the U.S. is huge - until recently it was the largest owner of property in the world - and it's been closing for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, won't be left behind by the Swiss bank.
It started with the financial crisis.
By 2007, U.S.A. used excellent news.
The image of a soft and solid but also distinguished owner of property is combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, the 2007 GNI spent $1.6 billion on one side more money on eligible customers than on any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she acted as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That's what made me think.
An ex-banker and a long-term banking professor at Curych Hans Geiger reports: "I always introduced the U.S. as a model of good banks to my students."
"From today's point of view, the man asks, "How could I be so wrong?"
He lied a lot.
In 2007, it was first evident that something in the U.S. was going wrong.
In the half of the year, Peter Wuffli, the head of the exhibition, who has been awarded the highest in intelligence and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was showered why he left.
The Investment Division of the Bank has lost Subprime-papers and had to cancel billions.
To stop this, U.S. has announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
Thus, she found investors who, despite the fact that she would still retain her nose: an invisible Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that a person did not even know its name.
But it was just the first time.
In April 2008, it developed a mountainside.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, another second best paid board of directors in Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: the U.S. remained in view of its misinvestment for the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank has purchased from the U.S. for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs to a mandatory variable bond for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was crushed - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet was more than five times higher than the effect of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We could not save the U.S. once again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster refers to the second.
Over the past few months, the U.S. has been capitalising in the tax dispute with America and has been willing to issue data from potential customers who, if possible, have withdrawn the tax.
Moreover, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return on the wrong profit from these transactions, including interest payments.
This led to more or less open GHGs to help slow down the tax.
At the same time, she lost something that she was renegotiating to her capital in the competition for a rich client: a saint of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
The Head of the Presidency and the President of the Governing Council followed.
And exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank has lost its credibility for several months in both central trading areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of property to help raise taxes.
And just when it's a little calm again, just when it's thought that the U.S. has fallen again, there's this unfortunate business experience: The only dealer lost EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And that's clear: with the risk management in investment banking, it's obviously still not enough.
"In the case of Adobe, the risk control has probably changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich Banks.
The financial director of the large German banks is also certain: "The U.S. problem is that it does not control the risk."
At the same time, it was exactly the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had long been making themselves guardians of the great wealth of the world: there was no too much risk, so the security of money - also from this side, the Albanian Republic had rediscovered the world.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become a symbol of the inexhaustible independence of Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly quality chocolate.
The U.S. Center in Curych is still going to a smart Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
It's classic already.
The bank has its main seat in the Currish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curysian island, which is covered by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, business rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
Clenocities like Tiffany's are found here between the Swiss traditional shops like the Srüngli sugar.
The Swiss banks are already sitting here after the season: from the Nationalbank via Palast der Credit Suisse to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall shall enter into the difficult back door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, with possible leather cross, next to the bank's logo a big guide to "seyfu".
The U.S. knows what the customer's looking for here: security.
This idea of Switzerland's two Swiss banks, U.S.A. and Credit Suisse, however, have sometimes been harassed or betrayed, as found by the head of one Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he would eventually end up as all Swiss bankers, as well as with both big banks of business.
The U.S. has probably increased too much, finding out, especially in the investment banking industry, where the Anglosas expanded.
The Swedes don't know what to say anymore.
"And if it were, they would adapt to long-term English ways."
In fact, it was an English investment firm that changed it for the first time and then a group: No European financial institution has lost so much money as Switzerland Großbank in the jungle.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"In the middle of that year, the government coalition of the small seven million countries was founded on the largest rescue action in the history of its people," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der GU-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about EUR 45 billion, have approved policies to save the bank from a bank.
How could that have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem especially in the size of the U.S.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined the potential group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland - and it was still growing.
It also helped to add to the two different banking precedents: One rich, but a bank in Kurych with a debt in the management of property and poverty, but more internationally involved.
The internationalisation of investment banks came well to a large amount of money that could solve a large roll.
Two names are attached to this GSP statement: Peter Wuffli, Head of the GWC Group and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a future team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages to feel around the stomach that he has developed from banking science all over the top."
But Ospel was finally on Wuffley.
And Wuffli's probably let go of solving errors: "If you thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The wind has passed.
The U.S. staff clearly recall the comments of the leading staff on which the Chief of Staff Wuffli repeated the same password: Get Goldman Sachs from the bottom tower.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She introduced "League Tables", a director who documented the success of the bank at that time.
She tried to put the U.S. on top of it.
A few steps have already taken her.
In trade with dividends and shares, the games were all up.
However, senior advisers who have been trusted highlight one weakness: In the international market, in the words of the Bankers 'Fixed Income', there is probably a large gap behind the largest banks.
The U.S. has mesers in American hypothetical products.
In order to close this line, the EU has agreed to the concession that has almost remained in existence.
Cold after growth, both banks have invested themselves and its own risk insurance fund in the US Subprime investments.
She developed into a powerful machine, which the valuable paper passed on to the American hypothetical credit and then passed on - but also left the risk alone.
Even when the other banks were looking for the east.
"Even in 2007 when the real estate market was in flames, the U.S. bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
As big as euphoria, it's so deep.
One manager had to go after another when attempts to calm down were harder than she thought.
The positions in the U.S. have become a catapultary seat and are expected to date.
Whoever runs the bank now, he's got almost uncontrollable work.
He has to find strategies for the bank that have lost all nearby business models.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End with investment banking, property management concentration, return to Swiss roots.
The bank's (still) not going to go so far.
But investment banking has got to be strong, so clear now.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italy was understood to be only as a transitional solution when the bank miraculously broke up with the predecessor of Grübel.
In the meantime, he went on: He had a long-term business trip, he sent the Kurdish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to status in the mid-1990s.
3500 places of darkness.
But that won't be enough.
The U.S. needs a visa.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking himself now.
But he's already saying he's gonna find his wife first in Curych's apartment.
Next year.

Europe will probably not leave the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this view: he said in one CNBC interview that it would probably not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the old principle for several decades and entered the American technology industry.

Intelligent waves expand in cities
In many places, the havranni are dedicated to "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals have long been unable to express themselves, assertive experts.
One of them likes it, another likes to get rid of them quite quickly: Returns belong to the city’s image, although in some villages the population is growing sick to an unclean and wild animal caused by it.
There's no way against the "problem birds" yet to take a look at some medium.
The Havrans were probably unable to excavate from the city, and experts at the first symposium on war in eastern Leer.
There, experts from the entire community consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
The conservation of nature also led to problems in the city from the exodus, particularly the protected garden: Use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to reduce the traditional area of life.
Tracking, growing construction and cutting of typical trees for the nesting of birds are life-threatening.
The guards are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 snowy pairs are outside the Western Soesta, in the north-west, outside of Jever, Diepholzu and Achim in Brem and Leer.
There he called for a 2005 anti-mass killing project of a negative title in the foreign period.
Critics have marked the departure of animals into feed for birds and the killing of crickets, especially brutal.
"Normal shock, fear, nothing is causing," found so much urbanist and Ukrainian Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of snow by throwing water or cutting trees has often adverse consequences, said the expert on the environment of Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Badensk-Württemberg.
"The animals rise, the great colony jumps and divides into other places."
Fear is only thought to be an exception to hospitals, foster homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out of here."
Without the surrounding area, the city can't solve the problem, was the opinion of Wolfgang Kellner's age from Leer.
It is thought to be a combination of animal extinctions from sensitive habitats and their additions to be found elsewhere.
"The information table instead of retreading pills" promoted the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of the very different behavior of animals: "One bullet in the face we can finally stop with our own consciousness."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded at Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's scholarly feedback table on the life learning table of the highly intelligent havan full.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Ms. Jürgens had his own opinion also on the criticism of the birds caused by them: "This is about every form of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and complexity of animals are legendary: Habrans fill not only use help to reach the memory, but even as a help to their tool is made.
Researchers from Cambridge University recently tested behavior on four sharks as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones had to bring construction cuts to reach the mill.
Without a great trainer, they knew what size and shape must have a stone to cause the collapse of the plane.
In the second attempt, anointed ones had to solve a more subtle problem.
In all the wars that have been fought, the researchers have placed a small refurbishment with the laurels.
The birds couldn't have achieved their advantage.
All these researchers put their shirts in there.
From them, she produced all four animals of prey, which helped as a hunter to catch the prey from a trap.
Three of the four full-fledged sharks did it even with a cut.

Personal level massage
The emotionally strong new book Peter England with the name Beauty and charm: The Faithful History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of outstanding performances as your head is affected by it.
One advice on how to keep it at this moment: Remove this page carefully and make a backup from it.
With all the people in the Roman Empire, you will get to know Mr. Englund very well, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a mother - at times when you will feel the same as men and women in the history of you will experience disappointment and loss in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new location at the Swedish Academy, which makes Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite frankly, as an antihistoric work.
It contains a number of very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, but it is almost lacking in heights, energy journalists and debate on tactics and equipment.
It's not even the book about what happened, explains the author, as you read, "the book about what it was." It's mainly about "feels, insights, experiences and ideas."
"The beauty and charm" in itself combines the war experiences of 20 more men and women, on both sides of the baricade, from students and botanists to Hollow, doctors, rescue commanders and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become warriors, come to the end, get mad, or die.
Their lives are moved like flames of candles burned in the churches - new ones are added to the website of the courts while others are blocked.
Mr. Englund's book is from classic historical novels.
It is the idea that the first world war was only of horrible funerals on the Western front.
"Grace and charm" explores other places where the war dramas were held: Alpya, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book are dealing with the problem of falling in love with the snow, having to spend the night in a pyramid stage or getting involved with the presence of their t-t-t-t-ts.
From the beginning, it's about very clever reading.
The wolf will bury people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina chasing with a firing squad.
If you're going to start calling a gun from him and you're a woman who's home with her children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting close?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war has been fought.
"Vakuum arising from lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "was filled with dreams, ideas, hopes, concerns, premises, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and ghosts."
"Grace and charm" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young seafarer serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are everywhere from books, letters, and other material already published.
The description of their lives can sound frightening and frightening, but by including small moments and details, they are simply alive and reliable.
Many of them agree on working and comparing with him.
In the case of a German student, the author says, "The guns, the same guns everywhere."
"A cup of coffee, like a lynic, a rubber imitation, paper binding, wooden buttons."
He's still going on and describing food supplies in Germany.
It is referred to as "mass made of liquefied rice burned in a shoe bag (and filled with a false bone from the wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried broccoli leaves, bottled with wooden mats".
It states that there were "837 registered batches and 511 registered coffee bags".
Some stories are about dignity and dignity.
One American himself finds inner popularity and brutality, who proclaims war: "After all, you understand that this is a human nature. Never sit in comfortable circles with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books, and pretend that this mask represents civilization, and that I don't hide any bar in the hole."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that with the greatest likelihood of death soon, no one will even notice it, so that he will stumble.
"If a person finally makes peace with that sacrifice, he would at least expect it to happen before the air of gratitude to the public," he writes.
Instead, it looks like a "reviewer who's keeping secrets."
Other notes concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new toys.
"The more the conflict has become economic competition and the more competitive war," says Mr. Englund, "a lot of companies."
He caught up with what he called "a new kind of beast of the rise-up century: a vegetarian and ideologically inspiring mass murder in the arms of peace that carries out its bloodshed without coming up from the table."
People behave in a sudden manner, with pride.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual disease to avoid serving at the front.
"The worst example of this behavior was dealing with gonocox fever, which soldiers bought and sold to them genetically in hopes that they would end up in the hospital," he writes.
"You've got the most reliable one in the eye, which has often been hidden until the end of life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Gravese, Mr. Church of England is fresh, but it has never been shown, which is a good time for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, the way the war "extended inexhaustible forces: extreme nationalism, social revolutions, religious hatred".
People start to wonder why their leadership needs to be fought.
The best books on the first world war were much more than the complex record they had worked with, for example, "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussel or Romans such as "In the Western Front" by Eric Marii Remarquea.
Mr. Englund is giving priority to illegal eating.
Its book has the most striking conclusion that there are no periods of time in popular educational literature.
But I don't betray him to you.
However, you will seem like the author jumped out of the book at once, threw a page out of your hands and burned it.
After the past mistake this time in a minute, exactly the planned event
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some of whom were in the shelters used in street rooms.
Monday night on Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew of the action except a few high-ranking officials, and the others were first told that it was a exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases should not be repeated in recent weeks when, for example, the use of peppers against demonstrators, which had been violated by departmental rules, and in addition, the free public sympathies were transferred to the Squatts side.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at cleaning the Zuccotti park from the demonstrators was initiated until after two weeks of thorough planning and exercise.
The leading representatives were allowed to inspire operations more likely in other cities.
Massive exercises for conduct in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was ready for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have strengthened such training to deal with disturbances - anti-terrorist measures that include rapid mass police movement - focusing on the city’s Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The instructions to move to the park came a little "last minute" by someone who was originally explained to him only as a "training".
"I know a couple of police officers who were also allowed to do this, and no one certainly told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he would stay in anonymity.
"As to going to Zuccotti Park, they knew only the highest number of members of the department."
One of the reasons for the delay was the lesson that the city had already received.
On 14 October, the city representatives had to clean up the park, but then they got out of the plan because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they were gathered before the operation started in the park.
Subsequent actions have been taken by police from various units, including basic groups from around the world - dozens of police officers who are often used to strengthen the fourth with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people are coming to the park and coming back, so one hour at night was the perfect time when the action started.
"It was appropriate to carry out this at a time when at least people will be in the park," he declared.
Before the units appeared, they were arranged on the street between the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, cost-effective units vehicles with flashlights and amplions.
The light and stored message burning from the amplions of many demonstrators scared.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators broke their things and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 in the morning she didn't touch the only state she wanted to give the protesters time to get things wrong.
Other police teams were watched as they gathered at the end of the park so that they could get caught if there was a need for arrest.
The reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesman of the police department Paul J. Browne claimed it was for their safety.
However, many journalists take the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition, some police were acting rudely to her.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on the Church Street leading along the western border of the park could be carried out without problems.
The police acted in the western direction, and the crowd was moved to change the personal affairs of protestors, including the hostages and the impenetrable bags of full clothes, after which teams from the hygienic department were released, who immediately collected everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were expelled from the park. The documenting image material appeared shortly thereafter on the Internet.
The worst group of demonstrators got close to the kitchen in their camp, which was near the center of the park.
Some of them created a warrant and the police started their tactical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp have joined each other.
And two people took them to the tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the preparatory services were allowed to cross the barriers.
By 3:30 a.m. there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, a police statement came out.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
The majority of the arrests were due to "organisation of the resistance and the theft of the arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest appointed uniformed officer in the department.
The operation also participated personally in Phil T. Pulaski, director of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he did not share in the operation," said Mr. Browne.
The second group of police were waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be allowed.
On the Cortlandt Street street, block north of the park, and on the Pine Street street, block south of the park, were pulled out of the garage.
From these places, the police developed a protective dog away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers, many of which were equipped with protective equipment, were being pulled out further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The most wonderful night of action has passed south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, there was a demonstration south of Pine Street as he jumped onto the police car roof, and a few others who had released the air from the pneumatic police supply.
In one moment, he flew out of the shower.
At the end of the operation, one police officer was hospitalized and one protestant.
The committee meeting of the auxiliary workers will complain of the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants who came to work last month are planning to complain about the city. They claim that there was no need to leave and that there was discrimination, due to an unexpected impact on schools visiting poor students.
The Court of Justice is likely to have the latest options left to the District Council 37 committees in their efforts to reverse the exemption decision.
In October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who belonged to the highest number of paid city employees. Their exemptions from the management committees described the city as a compensation for the lack of access to the health care fund provided by workers who wanted to improve the budget.
The representatives of the city rejected the charges categorically.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that the exemption was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately argued that there was no specific reference in the budget to the exemption of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would complain about them.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education will be indicted in the process, while the complainant will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are Africans or Spanishs, as are most of the other assistants who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a lawyer of the city's legal department, said that the city had not yet seen a complaint, and therefore it will not be disclosed to each accused.
According to the New York Times disease proposal, the committees focused on the number of people left in the poor parts of the city who wanted to support their claims about unfair conduct. They also maintain that poor schools have come to more assistance because they have long been exposed to sufficient financial resources.
They show that while schools in the Staten Island area were not available at all and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, District 23, in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were employed, and in the District 8 and 9 districts in South Bronx, up to 46 attended.
She recalls that in the 36 public school in Harlem, five out of eight assistants have lost their jobs, although it is about a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. She says, "It is not about the presence of full-time mobile parents who can have financial resources to balance the deficit in the budget."
The number of public school 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year and the school also received money when the city changed the method of calculating the bonus funds for every poor student reported.
In addition, the Committee claims that the principals of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which the document was written approving the release of parental coordinators.
The document used the term "excess" to describe the action, and thus delete the position, since this word is more often used to describe the transfer of teachers from the school payroll to the database of available staff who may be removed from the central authority.
"Sixty parents' coordinators have been released," they say on the proposal of complexity, "and not just moved to the database at the position of available workers."
The mission is at the end, Congress is ready to agree on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress agree on something about the rise in Libya.
Before that came, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddáfi had to be arrested and killed and to participate in the United States unit.
On Tuesday, the Commission will decide on the international relations of the Senate, which supports President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should congratulate the Libyans for their successful rise to American unity.
"In this statement we want to assess the attitude of the Libyan people who started to build their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sciences mentioned may seem innocent, but no debate about Libya has so far been difficult.
For years, both sides had agreed with the White House to change the order of the declaration for approval or to reject the military role of the United States in NATO mission in Libya.
In June Kerry and McCain presented resolutions allowing the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in Snow because of the different views of both political parties, so it was never voted for in the Senate.
On the same day that this proposal was rejected in Snow, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop financing American operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission in Libya has recently been seen in the legislative cleaning process - Congress has criticised the way President Obama's mission is directed, but his members have obviously failed to do so to stop supporting him in his early years.
The convention was finally scheduled for another event.
Rebels arrived in August and on October 20th he was killed by Kadáfi.
Mass Nato officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its declaration "bless Libya's citizens for their unmistakably attitude and unhindered attitude towards their people" and "glorify the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in operations for the protection of Libya's citizens, for their extraordinary stateliness and professionality."
The statement also states that "the United States' national interest in the successful and irrevocable transition to democracy in Libya is confirmed."
Is there a new proposal for full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be re-divided into two-halfs, as it was when the Green proposal was adopted?
The last version was set up by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief representative of the Republican party in the Commission.
Lugar's speakers said on Monday that the final version of the new proposal had not yet been seen.
In Snow this week, we will vote on the addition to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, sponsored by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first supplement to the Constitution on the budget or other subject to which the whole of the Treaty or the Senate will vote.
The other legislators have not yet been able to reach their own vote, even through considerable effort.
The proposal is only one of the 68 supplements to the constitutions presented at the Congress and covered a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented in the Snow and the Senate - while others are only small exchanges.
Only at least 15 versions can be found in Snow, which would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are quite clear, but their residues - especially the starting republicans who want to improve their history - can be mixed with their "authority".
The report on the regulation of the budget approved in August required that the Snæmovn and the Senate vote on the addition to the balance sheet.
In March 58, the senators voted in favour of an optional declaration to support the outcome of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to extend the number of periods during which members of the Congress may serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that should be the president.
The representative of Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole range of supplements that would in addition guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an addition prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition prohibiting the burning of state trains.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of the States are against it.
Although it appears that the members of the Congress are very active in proposing the various supplements, compared with the previous years, they are not significantly absent from the average.
In 111, 77 additional delegates were offered at the convention, while 66 were attended at the 100th.
Their activities are even visible in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the Senate library members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current policy.
The last addendum added - 27th addendum - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Shut up, but not broken," says Gifford in his first television conversation from the shooting
Ten months after she was shot by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Giffford (Ariz.) appeared on public television on Sunday evening, sang along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and announced that more than coming back to Congress is about to be healed.
Gifford's "20/20" series appeared at ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of a world still makes her problems and needed help.
The entire series documented her difficulty in reconvalidation, which was necessary because of the damage caused by the bullet that had caused her cancer, left half her brain, and then left her head out.
Three months ago, she was surprised to come back to Snow so that she would vote on the debt ceiling in triumphally.
During his first television interview from the gas strike, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Gifford laughed, laughed, laughed, and sang - while his beating was described as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, 14-year-old Gifford answered, "It's good.
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of the clock special part of the series "20/20", which was sent on the morning of the publication of the new book of this couple, called "Gabby: Experience of Hope and Hope".
The special was following the entire Gifford reconvalence from the 8th of January.
On videos surrounding Kelly during the first week, you can see Gifford's in hospital bed with his head covered and long hair covered all over the head.
While her husband wakes her up, she can't do more than raise one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Gifford was caught sitting in a wheelchair and learned how to perform simple tasks.
Head-up.
Squeeze.
And then, her first word, "Co."
During a few days, Gifford's next word was "toast", when he asked for changes in his breakfast.
The video released by ABC shows that the critical role of playing Gifford's music player: Congressman sings them together with a song therapist to song "Girls Just Wwana Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During Gifford's conversation that costs two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that he had nothing to remember since the day he was shot.
Her husband said that Gifford had read news articles about the shooting until 12 March, when she first asked who was the six who was killed in the incident.
The shooting was suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who was detained in the Missouri prison, where he was under the influence of violent medications waiting for trial.
"A lot of people died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Great, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that his wife once said during the reconvalence, "I played."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly wrote.
"You got a boot.
But you'll do it, you'll be together and you'll get back stronger than before."
Military units meet with a judge more than with an account.
This incident was a Wall Street golfer who brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York, who don't have a bullet on their head.
Kid Rock's singing the ball about weakness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, planes, and marinas ran around him.
A gloriously dressed tax was lifted and weighed.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered to be heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the iron benefits.
The chairman of the Committee of Heads of State was also present at the festival, but was also admiral of Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of military units in a somewhat different way.
"They were all represented as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought so well.
I know you do.
Just what I saw was not an account, it was a pity.
Thus, accurate perceptions only illustrate a narrow relationship between the army and often balanced, sometimes glorifying the American public.
The military is soon included in praise of its victims.
It's just that this blessing stands for something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like one in uniform.
"We are not a victim at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who had a lot of units in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"Because it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us into the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or to show off their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face when returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most terms of mourning are expressed in silence and in private between war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from the war operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would be looking out for two jobs.
Some will feel respect and admiration for them because they have been persecuted by enemies and visited exotic places.
On the other hand, he will turn his head if he "does not hide evil under the surface, violent veteran," said Cancian, who participated in the wars in Iraq and took a place in Washington in the government after his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, so some people who were talking to him suddenly pointed out whether he could cope with the stress associated with the work in Washington so soon after his return to war.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative reactions," Cancian taught his son.
The anxiety of the army is partly due to American hostility to war.
The success of the military field is limited to a small lack of recognition in the country, which has only little knowledge of its own army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only a little of its own success.
"As a nation we no longer consider military loyalty as usual for the second world war," said General David Barno, who was a member of the United States unit in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are listed for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to resist rape.
This week will decide whether 28 women and men will be brought into trial because of the alleged inaction in the event of violence.
If not, they are ready to file a complaint to hundreds of other sponsors.
Elizabeth Lyman's first class was on the night she was reportedly raped by her military colleague 25 years old and was on the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she moved to a casino on the Miramar airport north of San Diego. After dinner, she met a friend at her male colleague with 12 beer.
He asked her if she could join her so they could ask her in her room a little bit.
"In my head, I've got a flashlight," wrote Lyman.
Only her parents, Texasan, simply ignored her intentions.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
He claims that just a few minutes after they got into her room, the man passed her to bed and raped her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present or former members of the army will wait for a hearing worth which could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington, Virginia, and will be held before the trial of the charges against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The charges show that Gates and Rumsfeld were engaged in a fight against the spread of violence in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
However, during the following months their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claimed that they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army, after the announcement of these attacks, sat in the investigation, torture and any charges of justice.
Burke says he's going after the church to the highest-ranked army leaders because the problem starts right at them.
"Armada is a directive system," she says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to hinder efforts to take action against such acts?
Burke also claims that she contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of the other complaints made in the future.
Its strategy: More than to collect all charges on this case - it has put all the eggs into one basket, as it says itself - it complains in several different cases if it is necessary to prevent the pressure.
The defence department shall lead the representatives of the United States Neil MacBride, who, together with its staff, shall contribute to the suspension of the case.
The court documents that Newsweek received are detailed about the defence strategies - in principle, that current or former soldiers cannot complain of any injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the Supreme Court Regulation of 1950 called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"Superious injuries concern the military services of the mourning ones," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused to disclose this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1990s.
Although women must still not officially serve in the war, it is only about slanting: in modern wars it can only be difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops played a more prominent role, especially in the field of communication with civil women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization to come into the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, except for her three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services are preparing to apply for the four main military academy for the supposed development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred against women.
Depending on this, the non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects the basis for its complaint against the army. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of "manage of personality", which was clearly found in the victim of rape to have a memory of their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagati, who belongs to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a simple practice.
In December, her group had already submitted a proposal to the State organisation to deal with the vet, which was accused of discriminatory practices, to which a request for assistance from persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
At the Congress, nine independent proposals were presented by a group of senators and MEPs from both sides and proposed a series of corrective measures.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual attacks were reported.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the report of the Pentagon, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred during that year.
The March report also discussed the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 per cent of cases reported in the army - half of which were brought to trial by the civil justice system.
The complainants in the case of Burke's accession only describe the attacks as the first of the whole series of traumatizations.
The first class of Lyman, for example, reported a particular rape of the military police not long after what had to happen to him.
During the night, she said she was required to return details of her rape to several police officers, doctors and leaders ten times.
She submitted all the tests necessary for the determination of rape and found the victim's blood in her bed - from the wounds she had taken care of.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman held a hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she had fell in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons who as witnesses of the story were invited to testify in the favor of a certain priest who was finally released from prison.
"I remember the day the sentence was passed," says Lyman.
"I had the feeling that I was born right there - with a cry from the court of justice."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my senior officer, "It wasn't his trial.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, which he described as incapable of serving.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without a warrant and no warrant.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other applicants moves into another phase or not, it is a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University.
However, it notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to enter into the next phase of operation."
However, among them is the aforementioned doctrine that has been criticized since the first time that the light of the world has been seen.
I am the life-threatening critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is a few decades back because their duties do not allow them to maintain the same level of motivational and threatening resources.
He adds: "The chances are difficult against him... but it's important for them to try it."
It's only when good people are willing to fight.
In the absence of a decision in their favour, Burkevoá, the lawyer of the complainants, shall collect hundreds of other persons ready to submit the complaint and shall start working on other issues relating to this matter.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, from where it does not come to reform," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes before.
Zdi has eyes: How scientists study you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new form of legal extremism in Europe, he was only another young man who presented his anti-corruption views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who admitted to the Russian killing, after which 77 dead people were left in Norway, participated in his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could be alone, he was certainly not alone in the cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer during the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the legal groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of the year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
Just how to find it?
Easy - it's enough to print on Facebook.
"We realized that meeting them is not really that difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author recently published reports of a British research team dealing with European digital population.
The source of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have made it easy for them to make use of the advertising on the pages and, thanks to its clarity, set up a search for a demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
The Bartletts team found around Europe half a million fans of rights groups, focusing on them and sending insulates them, but instead of calling them into new groups or offering them some diet products, they called for a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, violence and optimism in view of their own future.
By means of Facebook with Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries were able to obtain results - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line stand-alone groups are young men in the community, who promote growing mobility.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activity with off-line activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain hidden behind the screen of the computer."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers are using these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends, including updates of attitudes, air contributions and pressing the button "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data per day, making from this social network the term "information supernova", which stands for the development of many new research. The number of academics in which the word Facebook is provided has grown in the state of about 800% over the past five years.
For some scientists, Facebook has been disturbed by the fact that it allows people to study without having to burden them somewhere on the street.
"Before it was paid that if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where you'd be, but they'd never let you go," says Bartlett.
"This whole Facebook cancels - you're just going straight to it."
Others claim that the website can offer a way to identify and avoid social-health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of Wisconsin University, a research team found that university students who collected their opiate outputs on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were blind.
Moreno suggests that the students of the site monitor and come with the help of a student who publishes too many drunk status.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can't diagnose it," said a letter from Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren's and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify threatened children, which we should not otherwise reveal."
Facebook itself continues to probe the data of its users.
The information team developed statistics on the relevance of the related status and day of St. Valentine, voluntary participation in 2010 and the coefficient of national peace (especially with the use of the information available to them - the rest of the Internet freedoms have long claimed that the website should have its own information base for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - instead of having a chance to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide its personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect offline data. However, online data is available to everyone.
"I think most users didn't even think that scientists could observe their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge Lab, who conducted a 2006 study with the use of public Facebook views of his students.
"If it was about them, they read it so that information was only between them and their friends."
The following is also to consider the question of methodology.
In the case of an off-line search, there is no guarantee that the entity is quite honest.
On Facebook it is not possible to verify how much information on the profile and contributions to the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two very different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that the pain and writer still remains the best tool he can use in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be rewarded," she says.
"Societal research should be about society and social activities - and a lot of social activities are still playing off-line."
"Creative and Negede": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to two attacks, during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway during his first public hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter.
"I am a military leader in the Norwegian Confederate and between the Norwegian Temple Ritters," he announced before the court, where 500 people were gathered.
"I testify against the court because your orders have been given by organizations that support ideology of hate and that they support multiculturalism."
"I know my actions, but I don't confess any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he wanted to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could vote for his views."
For the same reason, he refused to give Breivick, who brought up his prepared speech, to allow his victims to speak at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for the next 12 weeks, prohibiting him from any medium-term contact for 4 weeks and notifying that the competent authorities will have full control over all his visits and all correspondence within eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 neighbors and survivors.
Some have come to hope that Breivik will be able to look into his eyes, others to make sure that he is held firmly under the cover.
All were involved with the aim of taking the case to immediate closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and nelidish," said the NRK commentators one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't a pleasant thing, but I can say to myself that after I saw and heard a suspect, I moved a little more mentally."
Breivik, in dark clothes and blue tie, remained calm and professional all the time. When he came and went to the building without trouble looking for the next journalists and living in the eye.
Despite Breivik's odd idea that he was part of a larger "response", the judge admitted that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had a partner.
For someone, it may be a relief that attacks from 22 June appear to be the work of the only extremists and no radical groups.
However, this does not automatically reduce the barriers and strains that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I'd like it to look like a creature, but it isn't," said one of the victims.
"If so, it would be much simpler."
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in the film measuring to kin this week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5th, people who compared him to Henry Ford - and chose him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
At the recently reopened Jobs' conversation, which was forgiven for a special film that is aimed at the cinema this week, will be for all fans of Apple's company the fact that his creative thought was perfectly understood by the business processes and working flows of his products.
He was an amazing designer, artist and self-sustaining member of hippie, but also a pedant organizer and man, who has every detail of the boat - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "in fact, the idea is that 90 percent of their work is really great... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product is still a long road to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV series of Triumf computer jokes, which he related to the world of personal computers. During the course he played a unique, more than an hour conversation.
At that time it was ten years since Jobs had been brought to leave Apple, and he had full hands with his new computer company NeXT, and was impatiently watching how wide the public is taking the Internet.
Finally, only a short part of Cringely’s entire conversation was used on TV, and the original copies of the interview were considered missing during transport.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the registry garage.
Directly this material, satisfactorily assembled, forms the basis of the 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which measures to the selected kine this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has said no to give further talks, Jobs here is so surprised that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the discussion, it will be that between the question and the answer there will be a further pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thought when you see how Job's answer is perfectly thought to be the highest and most straightforward.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism is on the surface, when questions arise impatiently and push him to get to the more important issues and issues.
The discussion was still set before the euro of Pixar, iPod or iPhone and appeared in it to be terrifying prophetic thoughts when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and bad while offering their own vision of the future on the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job's death assessment, but on Jobs, whom we see here as a bright picture of his genius, is something of acid and inspiration.
He has his own vision of how things might and should look.
It didn't last long, and after expressing his thoughts, he also began to put into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is of the utmost importance:
How the company learned to manage:
"During the business year, I always asked, "Why do you do this?" and the answer was always the same: Well, it just does."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, he never thinks about things about business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple's company.
He was simply confused by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with the "standard costs", of which he could only think of. At that time he decided to express his own way - he developed an automatic tool that promised to determine the commercial costs within a few minutes.
As he carried out his work on paper:
Jobs refers to the "Modern Crab", which he shared with Steve Vozniek - a device that enabled people to make an effective return to the telephone company and to call anywhere in the world free of charge.
The device was already written in the past, but Job’s arrogance, when he described the Modra as a powerful tool, is quite demanding.
Just how they tested Wozniak using a flat phone and were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half of the time we flew this way around the world, so when we called something into the flat phone, it called it a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and found out that we were able to do this by ourselves, which is capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
We made ourselves a little thing that was able to control a lot more work - it was incredible experience and I think it would never happen to Apple without it.
Jobs continues to write a letter of cherries that had almost ended with Vozniak. Through the middle of the night, they called into the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the pope, since they seemed to be the best for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, they were allowed to continue higher membership of the Catholic Church in order to talk to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up on the phone, the two of them looked up and listened.
How he loved technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, he took out the repair parts so he could set up a kilometer, found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs already had an summer Brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"Unbelievably, it was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what this company really is and how it should be dealing with its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever built".
He was as big as a coward, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager in the HP, I made a high and high, I flashed around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation imagines:
In a number of places, Jobs is talking about how new products are invented during the discussion.
At the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of bags with flat connections, one customer asked him to set up a total computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid, during which he had to think, mix and add the equipment.
When he was later in Apple's company, he mentioned the problems that started when he developed computer muscles:
"I remember how we got pretty wild... crying to me that it would take five years [to set up a mouse that would be worth $300], when I stopped playing, I went out and found a designer."
Nineteen days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable 15-dollar bridge.
How big a company is going to breathe:
Long before Apple’s resurrection, Jobs apparently predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would corrupt and lose their share in the market.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or prints, so what's next?"
You have a monopol market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At this point, the government has already decided to leave and marketing, so the company's bosses are the people who care about this right, while people who care about their own products are excluded from the decision-making process.
The technological genius, which has led the company to its undisputed position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - generosity and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox's company...
Xerox could own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
However, the place of victory was lost.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
"There's still a long road and a lot of work between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product... and as this wonderful idea develops, it changes and expands."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to join a whole series of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factory you will not take.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and build them together...
Finally, it depends on the experience - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a certain way you try to turn them into what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed that I've got the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful that the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and even the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, great things could be done in all other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with a violation of the Health Care Act at the time their case was brought to court
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a political controversial question, whether he would take an action against President Obama's medical care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the celebration dinner sponsored by a legal firm that would participate before the court.
It happened last Thursday, when all nine judges came to discuss the proposed proposals.
One of the cases identified was the complaint by 26 States that suspected radical treatment of medical care, which was approved by the Congress - a law that mobilized conservatives around the world.
The judges agreed that they would hear the complaint. However, in March the 5.5-hour meeting is expected to open up further the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full force at the time of the decision.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and will try to target the rejection of the law will be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under the government of George W. Bushe.
Clementov's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of about two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinners, which has been following conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade unions that are in conflict with the law, i.e. the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge financial resources in the process.
Tonight was a few hours after the court discussion on the case in Washington.
She also participated in it, along with others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a certified copy of the Health Care Act.
And the introduction of the guests?
It's nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Group for years.
And it's definitely not about anything that would be contrary to ethics rules.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which lower federal judges are required.
If that were not the case, however, their conduct would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which states that "the judge may participate in actions that are directly related to and other organisations to obtain financial resources, neither shall the judges be a speaker, a honourable guest, nor shall they be placed on the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms that are effective in the case, as well as companies with huge financial interests in this case, has been rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and hostility to the code of conduct is in dispute with several judges that the Supreme Court is acting in accordance with the same rules as it is paying for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate on social benefits together with legal representatives who are waiting for their case to be brought before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of financial resources through this action will cover the feet with any claim of non-interest, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have only shown little understanding to their critics and have shown them that they also combine their judicial duties with the actions of a group, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife Gini is a highly established conservative activist.
Conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly the Judge Elena Kagan and not any Scale with Thomas.
Kagano worked as a general prosecutor for President Obama's government when the first charges against the law were issued before the court.
Kagan’s critics pressure her to take part in the case and claim that she was fighting so much for the law that she could not be involved now.
Kagan's never meant she'd want to leave.
Boeing received a record order on the aircraft operating value of USD 18 billion
Emirates airlines are ordering 50 two-way passing flights to Boeing 777 with 20 other purchase options.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner flights to Aman Air, for which it invests more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order on 50 pieces of its products, it's mostly no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is a manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50-year-olds makes a total of USD 18 billion, that is something else.
The same important message is where Boeing obtained the order: The Middle East, expanding the gold reward for future flight orders.
According to the forecast issued in the afternoon, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 tonn worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
The Boeing company announced its greatest order on the weekend in history regarding the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 double-way Boeings 777.
The murder warrant came from the Emirates Air Force station in Dubai.
Boeing company at the 2011 airport Dubai Air Show reported that airlines are able to buy another 20 flights, which would result in a total of $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airline had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is significantly better consumed fuel and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six years exceeds $1 billion.
"It's an excellent message for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analysis for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
A lot of aeroline in the Middle East belongs to darker nations.
This means that they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but the growth of the prices of the pedestals - most damaging airlines, because it's one of their most expensive costs - is not so profitable because the country itself is producing at higher prices of oil.
This is important because they are not as likely as other aircraft, so that they can steal or fire orders because of the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," she says.
The Emirates Aeroline ban aligns Boeing's leading position on the market with a wide body aircraft and leads to Airbus SAS, which sought to break the Boeing Company's dominant position with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after the Airbus representatives announced that it will be the first year of their largest A350 flight, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER.
The removal was due to the fact that customers were demanding a more favourable charge of aircraft and aircraft, so the manufacturer took time to be able to add more engine power.
The price of the Boeing company's share increased by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The Mexican President's sister was beaten according to everything in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponents, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, helped the government's drug dealers in battle.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderona lost his post in violent state elections in Michoacán, and the following Sunday she announced that one of her opponents helped drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results were accompanied by guidance in the government elections of the western state of Fausto Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
"The actions of members of organised crime in the entire voluntary process, and especially in the morning of the elections itself, are alarming not only for Michoacán but for our entire country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in the radio speech for the day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion study group... they were playing volleyballs, they set up road patrols... and they let people vote on the order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when the presidency came.
However, he plans to return to power quickly and victory in the battles in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win in July in presidential elections.
Vallejo seems to have betrayed Calderon, who's still running the day before the elections, just very quietly.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for his brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to acknowledge Vallejona as a winner.
Thirdly, Silvana Aureolis, a candidate for the left hand side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has so far been the authority of the government. For the deliberate and violent party, the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results for payment.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and sends out other candidates for recognition of the results.
Michoacán has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is about the native state of President Calderona and right in Michoacán in December 2006 a military war has begun against the rebels.
Violence, however, has continued.
An elderly PAN, stepfather Luisy Marie Calderon, was murdered only a week before the elections and many candidates from the election turned away from fear.
However, even if the results of the election in Michoacán appear to be due to the PRI side, the victory on the side will help to achieve a new momentum.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington Valley, welcomed and said, "I think this victory could be very exciting in view of the coming year."
The ADB Bank calls for Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare for assistance to save the euro area from its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could lead to a global fall in the world economy that would have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, director-General of the ADB Bank, sitting in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help speed-up the exchange block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are following all European difficulties "too close" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and resources would help to guarantee a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So everyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is happy," said the Financial Times during the discussion at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asie may be protected to a certain degree, but definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do so."
The European Monetary Union has been severely tested for several months by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s cost of borrowing has been very high and the Italian and Greek presidential governments have abandoned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could be reintroduced again, and calls were launched to bring new emerging economies together and to help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag suggested that all Asia's support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of financial assistance funds from the European Union, the European financial stability institution - would give Asian partners European countries a greater opportunity to do so.
And Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do what it can," to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a rise in foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unsatisfied," he said.
"We stand in front of a heavy task and must maintain high peace of mind."
"It's not an alternative, it's a big fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others feel that developing economies, such as those of the index, have nothing to do with helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to explain political aid for Europe 1.2 billion while 800 million of them live from 2 USD or less a day.
"One day they could find out that the Greeks go to bed in the fifteenth place and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, the Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why the Indian resources should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in the badly affected and lost sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening "hazardous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011/2012 and 7.5% of economic growth in Asia is now facing "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets must create "unpredictable expenditure plans" in order to protect them from the decline and a significant share of their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon regarding possible weapons in the field of defence
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta at Congress on Monday, he made a good contribution to the chain of action by warning that emerging automatic scars in the budget can threaten national security and create a financial network response that begins in the Pentagon and continues through the Afghan War to the civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to work to reduce the budget by $450 billion over the next ten years, but it is still afraid that another $600 billion will be reduced if Congress is unable to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The consequences of these massacres would be for the entire resort to destroy," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and therefore the so-called presence would result in 23% of the slowdown and the cessation of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this unreasonable way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of buildings or ships. Moreover, it could result in serious damage to other modernization forces," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will have to send almost civilians to the forced permit to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can be overcome by the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its preparation."
Finally, the raids also hit the war units, notified Panetta.
"Since the accounts for the financing of possible military operations in the atmosphere will not be directly affected, the darker operations will be adversely affected by major changes in the other budgets," Panetta warned.
"It comes to the courts and to the contractual staff, which will result in the delay of the contractual contracts supporting the military efforts of our people."
"There will be a reduction in the attitudes of paid employees, which will also result in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent infringements of legal and political support."
The two senators of Pannett signed down ten days ago and asked him for details regarding the possible effects of automatic assault on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the presence of the Ministry of Defence could cause rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military force."
"We are strictly against this strong measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday when they published Pannett's letter.
"It's not about the end we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned massacres are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"The first is to see whether Panett's letter and the clean warning increases the pressure on Congress to adopt and raise the voices calling for the removal of the Pentagon from the list of detached areas.
Panetta had recently been talking about possible gaps that were even more open, although he himself passed on his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience in approving the budgets at Congress and the White House, so he knew that he would go to war in the dark.
At the press conference, a minute of the week, the Minister of Defence pointed out a detailed picture of what his resort can expect - the army's shortcut inside which will fail the core.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without munitions."
"It'll be like a plane without trained pilots."
"It will be as a paper tiger, as an army of cashiers, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speech in the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morale, prepared and unable to solve any enemies."
"As a result, the aggression will be blessed..."
In the annex to McCain's and Graham's Panetta's letter, it specifies how it will have a reduction in "favourous operational risk: a late reaction to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; a clear limitation on the possibility of outbreaks and outbreaks worldwide; a anticipated unacceptable risk in future war operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to end, including those that have already been tested, and those that are first in the early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 project, planned for a new bomber, ballistic ponorques of the new generation, new coastal battleships, and a new underground vehicle, which she wanted to replace the army and the marine fleet with Humvee.
By stopping further development and testing of the F35 fleet, it would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters argue that further steps are needed to improve the army, which is needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivers.
How to identify a lie
The annual review of recent news headlines shows how serious and understandable lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands working on the accusation that he had sexually abused several women - both sides claim that the other one is lying.
The board members at the Penn State University were accused of lying testimony when they tried to hide the records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested, as the American President Barrack Obama says the Israeli President of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies managed to destroy all careers and block the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately issued with irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using funds from his campaign to try to escape his unanimity.
And no one ever forgets the media circus that shot around Bill Clinton when she lied during the second period about her sexual relationship with Monica Lewis.
It's just stories about college and university surrender all over the place.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their judges.
Mentors who should teach repetition send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many do we meet with?
Studies show that in one day, you're somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are kind lies.
Another study showed that foreigners were three times more likely to be caught in the first ten minutes of the first encounter in life.
The identification of lies, or the "recognition of lies", is an essential skill that should be won by everyone, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, this is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharrada, when a person shouts, "I have you". The recognition of the club is a serious science sector that has been working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during specific research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old lies were invented.
The liars look at you quietly.
It's not like they're standing up, they're cooking, they're red, they're messing around.
Don't get out of it, it's kind of hard to watch and discover a lie.
A trained identifier will be able to distinguish the truth from scientific buildings, small facial expressions, the way in which questions are created and the timing of them.
I've spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a wide and developing understanding of the field of understanding lies and it is clear that advertising is a modern skill that can easily be learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work obligations include renting, organizing talks, sharing or directing people.
Good liars can read well even in others, let them walk in caution, guide their emotions, and intuitionally know how the other party accepts them.
From research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men deliver more "medie" lies, while women say more lies "targeted to others" - most of them to protect some feelings - that women lie less often to their partners than free people (all lies which they say are most of them are "inexhaustible").
We also know that if you are considered a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, take note of the normal behavior of the entity.
It's called the initial observation.
Thanks to him, he'll have a later finding out what to compare with.
Note, however, that the person's body, his smile, works with the voice.
You should know if someone's always sneezing his feet so you don't blame him for lying just because he's starting to cover his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify the signs of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Berte, however, only as an alert signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who offer lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their thoughtful story, they can be pushed up to the door, pushed to the exit, explicitly change the body's hold or give a little "floating after the end of the conversation" - overextended breath and change of position when it is difficult to tell them.
People performing conversations often give a false signal that the interview is at the end just to see how it will look after it is finished.
Take the language of the subject as well.
It's a famous story about how Scott Peterson once changed his mind and spent the past time when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which ran the entire state patrol after her body.
The complaining individuals can also express themselves appropriately: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Mrs. Lewis" or a difficult question they're fully aware of.
The most common verbal signs are just very vague.
Someone can use a lot of "the calming language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... let me tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such an answer, we do not know too much about the facts and often there is another warning signal.
There is no cure that could expose every lie, but it is possible to gain the skills that can be followed by a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of becoming a liar and a liar in his personal and work.
Controversial plan for the construction of the roll-out will be redirected after a threat to the US government's approval risk
A few days after Obama's government threatened to withdraw the approval of the planned mining effort from Canada to the Mexican Gulf - which was respected by the committees, but calmed the environmentalists - the company of the construction industry announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things could move again.
The TransCanada company announced on Monday evening that the planned route is being moved from the ecologically sensitive Sandills region in Nebraska and is convinced that the project will be approved.
This decision was notified by the company to the press conference in the seat of the Government of Nebraska.
The Group of TransCanada Alex Pourbax argues that the company is convinced that the construction will eventually be approved, although it will take another route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it would reject a decision on the federal permit of the project, where it would not conduct a study of possible replacement routes, which would not be possible to interfere with the Sandillas region in Nebraska and the Ogalla waters.
"This is a real move ahead," said Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental judgement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have rejected any decision by 2013, so the next year after the elections, the authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
In a written statement from last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support.
1,700 miles long effort will link Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refinery in Texas, he daily protects 700,000 barrels of oil.
This road will have to be over 6 states.
This project simply hates environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who assume that 20,000 new jobs are being created at work.
However, the lawmakers in Nebraska set out against this plan and took into account the introduction of laws that would prevent the company from entering the Sand Hills region and into the Ogalla water species, the main source of drinking water and packaging.
The ongoing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, as well as a source from the energy industry, said that the general inspector of the Ministry had ordered a new review of the whole process of initial study and focused on two questions.
It was once whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was counsellor Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not represent the conflict of interests.
Further, whether the company which was assigned to the original study was not selected inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of causing her to throw fear away.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle suddenly broke into their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so that she was scared of it.
The performance of the "Lady Marmalade" hit the eight-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she endured "the personality changes, the loss of sleep" and "the increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a complaint to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th of last year, Professor Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a teacher at school, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk joined the car, Roseanna Monk went down to their house in the part of Riverside Boulevard and took her and Genevieve with him.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and left the baby for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind me and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I went to raise her."
LaBelle's pregnant woman was suddenly crying.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't take your daughter to the door,' said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you think."
She broke up and started talking slowly - she screamed out the simplest words...
She had a lashe with water and started waiting for me.
He says Genevieve got hysterical arrest.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle took her mother - who was still in the arms of Genevieve - and had to stop her until her delivery, which then took her to the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the middle of the day, the girl had so much to say when she got back, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter in which LaBelle apologized, but they had no answers.
Lawyers and linguists LaBelle don't respond to our phones to express themselves all over the cause.
The complaint calls for a closer to the immediate damage, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family is planning to hire a charitable organization dealing with children with cancer.
"The aim is to introduce Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is simply unacceptable, especially if it is intended against teachers from school holding an eight-month-old child."
Non-compulsory climate degradation
During the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdze grew in Sinaloa unemployment and unemployment, reduced foreign investment and the economy.
The year 2011 is written in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, which is called the government itself. This government has brought with it a great expectation for economic progress, however, because of the unacceptable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth and there has even been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low soil temperatures have caused millions of agricultural losses, hampered the possibility of growth in the state economy, have experienced a 3.6% reduction in economic activity in the first half of this year. In agriculture, there has also been a 31.16% reduction in historical decline, which has damaged the dynamics and other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damages were recorded on 582,835 hectares of processed land, 78,03% of which were completely destroyed and 21.07% were found partial damages. Among the main destroyed crops are greenery, corn and games.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, unemployment rates in the state had increased during the first three quarter. From January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloa had been unemployed, representing unemployment rates of 4,53% of the economy's active population. In the second quarter unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment rate was 6.19%, representing approximately 74 000 unemployed people.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantese, director of the UAS Department of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained directly on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. Among them, among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market is due to the restrictions of resources due to the legislation that the Congress has adopted in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally strengthen dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them," he said.
Stops of migration
López Cervantes pointed out that unemployment growth is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, in the United States, has decreased, however, for the reasons of easy entry and then because even if these people get to the border, it is difficult for them to get work. So people stay and ask for work from our state, and so on, unemployment is growing," he said.
Incompatibilities
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa also deteriorates due to increasing unemployment, which prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employees in the state are working without taxing social security management.
Other labour market lines such as low wages are added to unemployment and unemployment. In this administrative area, the lowest payments from the entire country, as indicated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was 5,352, deeply below the national average, which is moving to a portion of 7,375.
Short-term foreign direct investment
In line with the decline in economic activity and unemployment growth in 2011, the highest direct foreign investment decrease in the last 10 years was also recorded. According to the Ministry of Finance, from January to June, the direct foreign investment of $630,697 was reached, representing an 87.74% decrease of $5 143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the State will report investments of 17,280 million pesos per year. These investments directed primarily to services companies.
Decade
With regard to the economic decline scenario, the government requested the State Congress in July to accept a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be allocated to investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to restoring the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos.
Reaction
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government's Maria Lópeze Valdès showed that the government's leadership was lacking.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chambers of the Transforming Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of compliance with the wishes of the individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been very unwise during this year. We have to work intensively to get back the soil that we lost in the year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, lack of harmonisation of efforts for all of us, and especially the correct and synchronous functioning of this new government. We hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
The economic downturn
Loredo López pointed out that events like hate at the beginning of the year had stopped the state economy and undermined its development and growth.
"The poor economic movement was caused by a series of events, other than hate. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which was quickly ignored so that it could regain the dynamicity that would enable it to achieve a acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year, we were deeply affected by the expected forecasts," he said.
Re-definition of the message
According to Teodora Salazara Uriarte, President of the Labour Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state should be subject to more dynamic productive activities.
"We are generally aware that it is working, and we think that a long-term plan should be prepared to re-defined the State's objectives and economic direction, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is before us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision of the future that would better govern government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government is trying to achieve good results in various areas, and in the field of economic development, some progress has been made, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the area of public policy management.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be innovative. I can say that it is here to see the work done and I think that the government is aware that there is a lot of work still ahead of us," he said.
Exempted for 8 kg marihuany
The inhabitants of Navolato were sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison to eight kilos of marijuana.
The general prosecutor of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for criminal acts of health threats, in particular for the detention of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army components on 7 June 2010 on arrival at the Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the 80th station in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer went into a white pick up supplier. In the car he had a black bag and a seat with small bags. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the second division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the implementation of the legal consequences of criminal acts.
Debts of project contributions
Social projects, which are part of the programmes such as Habitat, the Protection of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, are at risk that they will not be charged to the end or that they will have a lot of delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if construction work has gone ahead so far, it is now dangerous that the government will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require funding of more than 11 million pesos on three programmes.
He pointed out that the total investment in these three programmes is about 50 million pesos. The state represents 25%. Only the Federal and City resources have been added to work by this time, so it is possible that the project will be delayed.
"They're supposed to make up for about 12 million and, although the year is over, we've got nothing. And even though we've already got a share in July," he said. "To avoid wasting time, we've started and we're going on very hard, but we don't have the money."
He pointed out that in the latter year, the State had failed to meet the relevant supplies and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, had to ask for a loan in order to be able to pay more than 7 million people who did not receive the State administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the past six hundred years because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the means to cover what was not done," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was an association of State representatives concerning the transmission of these resources, he indicated that the request was sent to Armando Villarreal, a secretarial for administration and finance to confirm the management and the corresponding percentage reached as early as possible.
"We were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is nearing the end, we haven't even got a pesos yet."
The court approves "the end of analog transmission" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional appeal submitted by the Senate and the Ambassadors in writing against the Presidential Decree, which seeks to speed up the so-called "analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It noted that there were not eight votes required to pay it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not extend his powers when he issued a decree stating the individual steps leading to the transition to underground digital television.
As a result, the complaint lodged by the Senate was dismissed and because the qualified majority of eight votes were not reached in order to make it possible for the court to express itself to the constitution or non-constitutionality of the said decree, which remains so valid.
The draft decision drawn up by the Ministry of Telecommunications, Mr Sánchez Cordero, presents the possibility of declaring a decree as non-constitutional because regulation of all questions relating to radio and television is a matter which is, according to the Law, rejected by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). It thus violates the principles of hierarchical equipment and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Senate supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and stopped applying the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitalization.
The Council of Ministers also decided to reject the application submitted by the Ambassador in writing, without entering into the debate on a proposal which is also concerned by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its presentation, the Prime Minister stated that he was not satisfied with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not be structured through the general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that, even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and he pointed out that planning public policies in strategic areas as a telecommunications sector is a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The reward of analog signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better quality of signal and more channels.
It is thought that to remove the change would be to remove the benefit from digitalization, which calls for a decision on public interest. Digitalization does not only have a technical dimension, but "is also relevant to economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of state economic direction, and include the whole range of competences that the Constitution believes in in the Government of the State".
He noted that a number of countries around the world have already completed transition to a digital system and have done so through their governments, although highly specialized technical bodies have been available.
He pointed out that it was not possible for the Government to issue a non-conformity decree, which, to a certain extent, applies to the area of the right of the Congress, to introduce administrative compliance with the laws prepared by the legislative powers.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of reading "voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is 27 per cent.
The possibility of counting "vote vote" appeared in annual elections in Michoacán, where, in accordance with data published by the Pre-Trial Electoral Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections was 27 per cent, and 879 votes were not yet started in the total of the 6074 electoral circles.
In this regard, the President-in-Office of the General Council of the Voleb Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ánges Landlandal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority had adopted a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal voluntary reform.
As still mentioned, Michoacán did not officially endorse his political constitution nor his State Voluntary Code or the Law on Voluntary Justice. The Congress had recently adopted reforms before it had to follow the legal deadlines for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel reminded them of their publication in the Act of the Official Journal of the State with some intention.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the status of the state's head in the matter of constitutional reform as "unpaid and illegal" because it does not have the right to "not accept or condemn".
On the question of the possibility of counting "vote" María de los Ángeles Llanderal answered that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would allow for a partial and comprehensive calculation to be carried out by the local voluntary authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more volleyballs, will be possible under the following conditions: voluntary results do not agree; there is no record of counting and counting in the relevant paragraph or no president available; or if there has been a mistake and a apparent deterioration of voluntary results.
In addition, the total counting of votes in all polls will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate at the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; always when the application of the candidate at the beginning of the meeting is expressed by the representative of the party and/or the coalition proposed by the candidate at the second place.
The total counting of votes will also be possible if, after the proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and that there will always be an express request from the political party whose candidate has completed the second place. In this case, the voluntary packages in which the partial calculation has been carried out will be listed.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP, there is a difference between the first and second places of 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral circles have not yet been counted.
His last will
His people will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalim, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transferred on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During the afternoon, he will spend a celebration and a pleasant meal.
According to the family, it was the last wish for its ashes to be scattered in the cave of the burnt offering.
After having received the highest honor with the others who had died during the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the main city of Coahuila to the landing of Mexican air forces. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, he reached the capital, Nazario Ortiz Garza, where his family and friends also came.
At 5:30 a.m., a resolution was made at the technical institute in Saltillo, which organized its former staff from the technical secondary school and members of the American football team, which was also a member of Felipe Bacio at the time of his maternity training.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the forest of the Fire. He always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot sister.
According to it, the deputy met all the wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and arrived at the Collegio del Aire airport in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went after his dream to be a pilot.
His son Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he recently came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahaccono to Saltillo."
A young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zappaan for the support of his uncle, so he was convinced that he had died in the worst of his life: flying.
Did you give him the last kiss?
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, a deputy of the Mexican air forces, we met with all the tribes that came to hand over Governor Jorge Torres López, civilized and government, Mexican army through the sixth military zones, the Mexican Air Force itself, leading representatives and students of the technical secondary schools in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he graduated both in the study and in the sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after a helicopter was dropped, he was also a secret officer of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of the state.
At 18:05 the rest of the Saltilles' parents Bacio Cortés (full) arrived to be delivered through funeral services by the Mexican air force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez on the transit where his family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, relatives and other neighbors, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the ship Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the arrival of the military, the representatives of the army had represented 11 persons who were detained in this area for criminal offences associated with organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed shots into various parts of the body and heads were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyt Jiménez, Nuevo León.
There were 1.5 kilometres of road from Cadereyt to Santiago, in the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the chat with the pool coffee table had time to open the door.
When they looked inside, from about three meters away, they noticed the death of three people, so they immediately warned the competent authorities.
One person had a sport triangle of yellow colors and dark brown pants and was not wearing. He also said that the man was in a sport triangle with white flowers.
A few meters later, the body was found by other people dressed in a red sport triangle and blue painted pants.
All three lay face to face on the ground.
According to the data obtained on sites, all three persons were probably killed elsewhere because they were not found.
On the floor of the chat were the links addressed to one group of organised crime of the other as well as a number of steps per bullet, as well as both at the station and at the doors.
In the Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained.
The National Defence Secretariat represented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of a criminal group, particularly in the area of Cadereyta, who were linked to rape, murder, prosecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first trial on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detained person was released.
Three property and mobile phones have been secured, confirming that they are members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6 p.m., the military personnel were on their way to the area of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta when they saw a car without a SPZ and two persons in it.
After stopping the car, they went through a search and discovered one gun, the shooters and 18 guns.
On the basis of these statements, about 14 hours were held on 13 November in the La Frauda area. When he watched soldiers, he tried to flee.
They were accused of illegal burial in the cities of General Terán, China and Cadereyt.
A new Italian government will be appointed in mid-term
The appointed President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that will hold this country above the destruction of economic disasters.
The President-in-Office of the Government of Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that will continue to plague this country over the destruction of economic disasters and which has put the whole euro area at risk.
The Presidential Chamber issued a report stating that Monti, named Sunday, will meet in the middle with President Giorg Napolitano to confirm that he can create the government.
It is expected that the government will be represented by a combined majority of the technologies, even though it is not yet clear when the new government is empowered.
Monti announced that he would present the results of his talks to the president, who led the political parties in an effort to create the government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to create the government, but his tone of comments indicated that obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the government's creation process in less than three days, so it is much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the debt to rise at an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim has to accept a solid package of measures that require European leaders, which will only be possible to restore the newly acquired credibility of Italy.
In Monti there is a great pressure to speed up. Due to the instability of the markets, the levels from the Italian debt sheet BTP were exceeded by a 10-percent limit, at the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcagglia, the president of the Italian company of employees of the Confindustria, told journalists after meeting with Monti, "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this armed situation.
Monti's hopes for success are well expressed by the support from PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis has been brought to a halt on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti have been made to achieve good results," said journalist Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the media.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because up to this time, the entire range of its members has been opposed to the government with the technological majority of Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament so that it can pursue non-populated sustainable reforms.
Any interruption or delay in this effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial market.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started on Monday meeting with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
The round of the meeting ends in the afternoon at night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday as President Napolitan, which allowed him to respond very quickly to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when Berlusconi had already been exposed, the Italian debt rates returned to the critical border and responded to such uncertainty as to whether the new president was failing to succeed.
To save Italy whose public debt is moving in excess of EUR 1.8 billion, it would be beyond the possibility of current euro area financial reserves.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts claiming that politics only gives him time to implement reforms and then announce early elections.
Monti pointed out that he would like to join his cabinet, but many parties insist that this government should be composed only of experts in order to remove Italy from the tension that the country has experienced because of the financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual mistrust and non-conformity among the parties are complex attempts to integrate into government and political personality.
Spain participates in international sports more often than in Costa Rica
Of the 22 Spanish footballists, ten are crossing the border of 50 international sports.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 authorized players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met on a friendly flight at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world's masters and Europe, the number one month's FIFA rating, have on their account a wide range of cross-border class A escapes, Costa Rica has only Michael Umman's defense, who as the only player played 50 international games.
This number reached last Friday on the battle against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spain's football players who play at the Starfleet and the powerful English first league clubs are maintaining intensive activity throughout the year on league champions and domestic fires and high-level flights in the framework of European games such as Championships League.
We must also add experiences from the Spanish National Team in complex sports events at the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, however, have very limited opportunities for foreign sports in the area. There is, for example, Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign auctions from the Spanish representative has on his account the banker Íker Casillas, who delivered last Saturday before England (the 0-1 in London) to former banker Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international auctions.
Casillas will also come against Costa Rica today and will receive a new record for Spain - 127 international flights.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 games on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of games in their account. Among them, the name Zubizarreta is 126 and the middle opponent Schalke, Raúl González, is 102.
The train approached Carles Puyol with 97 passports.
Following Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Inista with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michael Umana are moving left wing Junior Díaz with 48 steps and the branchman Brian Ruiz is 45.
Next only 5 crossed the limit of 30 steps: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of games.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't go any further than 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
The best Spanish shooter is David Villa with 50 balls and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, he has the highest levels of Brian Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintetto included the country in its tournament on the occasion of the twenty years of existence
"Cesta on Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive conversation for Viva, basicist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready next week to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the team itself ensures that they can play in Costa Rica is a full dream for them.
That's what he said to the bassist and the alleged member of Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the tournament on the occasion of the twenty years of existence and will be the only resident in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day is from 19:30 at the National Stadium with the Angelic Group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an indication of the conversation you will find on the La Nación website.
For your Costa Rican reception, it's a full dream. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you know what your fans are enjoying?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we're just a little bit of a little bit of a bit of space and experience was great.
It's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we have great joy that we can bring you our song.
I wonder, because the group is still praying here, the fans live these days very intensively.
What do you say to your smartest guests?
Thank you for staying with us for so long.
It took us nearly 21 years before we got to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long.
Some people are talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that make you feel more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've attended in the last 21 years have been in the horizon for a few weeks.
We've performed some great shows in Sao Paul and hope that we got to the concert in Costa Rica.
We're actually very happy with this concert.
We love this country, we love serfs, we like jungles. For two activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Kostari and her hair suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends drive surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or in Mexico, these are the best surfing places, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tournaments, you've prepared a huge show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning on your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we don't have any restrictions on what we can't do.
We'll try to imagine the best show with the various stocks. We'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and present our fans with a good and varied repertoire.
You're never packing a repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 stocks and everyone likes other stocks, so it's hard to choose which songs we're gonna play every night.
When we have in the repertoire two three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we loved them so much and that we may have forgotten it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's even more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art drama.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, it is.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine we would be in one big rock band and stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we were given, and we realize that we can still play together.
We love each other and we love to make music.
We're lucky we can look at the places we've always been after.
We couldn't get better.
What did it mean for you that you were a significant part of the grunt of the grunt?
We always felt that we could be part of this group where they are represented by themselves.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice and Chains are our friends.
It's amazing when noise comes out of a group of friends, so often it doesn't happen.
From time to time, time will arise in the city of the group, but it is much less common to take from one city five to ten groups.
We're proud of this and we're proud to be part of the Seattle team.
Sometimes we're playing some more games.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice and Chans and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We're happy that they're all our friends and we're grateful that we can be part of this hunt that took place in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to remain married and have the same members even after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is already much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first we all have the happiness that we're still in this world and secondly our role plays the fact that we're always interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this, we have been able to open up the musical paths that allow each of us sufficient freedom for our own experiment.
We believe in each other, think of each other's songs, and I don't think that could be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not easy, however, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find the equation?
As we grew up, it was gradually easier to find a balance.
We're trying not to go too far to the tournament because it's very easy to fall into this trap of taxes and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come because of music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it, you must not let yourself be ruined by the fact that you are famous, rock stars.
How do you remember next project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something big.
As a hat, we had three years and never released any album until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it lasted so long. Most importantly, today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us. When I hear a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy how incredible I was with him. It was always the joy of working with him, laughing, talking about music or football and many more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her very much.
The National Chapter of Las Robertas will be trusted to start the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as pre-selections?
Yes, the producer sent us a video with a few suggestions and this group liked us most. That's why we know what Las Robertas offers life and they have to be very fun.
Why do you always change the word Yellow Ledbetter?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think it adds the first thing to attack him.
Who's affecting you as a bass?
A lot of people.
As my first attack on Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so much I could talk about the bases I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam keep the gang, even though he's not in fashion?
I think we've always felt a lot easier apart from the words of the grunt.
When it's called the gang, I'm going to introduce myself to the groups that I've called Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that have come up at the same time, and if this song is still valid today, it's a great thing because it's the song that stands for listening to it and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At first, your music had a soft character and now it's more positive.
What's the point of this change?
This is interesting, because I have a feeling that in the new album there are some savings that are easier to draw, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very boring, although they can be described as positive.
Two times when Ed was playing me, I cried, and it's so deep that they're dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friends, these things start to affect your art and music and these two songs just represent me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make a dirty music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been hospitalized again for medical tests.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss suffered in the area of the underlying endpoints, informing his healer.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who recovers a 25-year sentence of deprivation of liberty by his government (1990-2000), suffers from a number of disabilities, including cancer of the tongue, which has been four-fold and has doctors at the moment under control.
Ambassador Alejandro Agusunaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori will be subjected to tests at the National Institute of Non-Plastic Diseases for three days, where they should find out why he is suffering and why he is losing strength in the low-ends.
Aguana said that according to his opinion, Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president did not accept mercy because he felt innocent.
He was four times injured by cancer of the tongue, weighed 18 kilograms, and other problems such as severe erossive gastritide, scar tissue, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bone problems were added to these problems, except for the doctor.
Fujimori has been punished since September 2007 by the National Police Office.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 persons who killed the murderer of a military squad who had committed illegal acts in the first years of his government.
Music on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguay's president, José Mujica, conducted by several ministers and businessmen, is on the Tuesday visit to Mexico. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
The museum is located in the center of Mexico's Mexican rival, Felipe Calderón. It is the most important meeting of the extensive visit to the full-fledged political, trade and representatives of the Georgian community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office published on its websites.
According to local media Mujica, he will try to take Calderón to support Uruguay in the conflict with France, which came when French President Nicolas Sarkozy organized the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his vision of Sarkozy, he threatened that the countries that will continue to remain in the position of the tax havens will be listed from the international community, which has led to a rejection of the Uruguayan position and consultation with the majority in this European country.
Mexico is President G20 from November. G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries of the world. With the mention of the Latin American country, the agreement on exchange of information to prevent double taxation has been concluded this year.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has urged the adoption of a fiscal exchange agreement with a view to obtaining from the "black list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on which countries have not met all the international standards for cooperation in the field of taxation.
From the business perspective of Mexico and Uruguay, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been concluded since 2004, thanks to the strengthening of trade between the two countries.
Vousted installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the chaos of Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all the world's shops has already been created to use all the features that offer Nintendo 3DS transfer console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without using glasses.
"Mario is a post that must say how stereotypes should work without glasses," said a staff member specializing in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of video games in Madrid.
Álvarez pointed out that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video of Nintendo created especially for this wearer", because by this time successful photos like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zerda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
Speaking Nintendo said that in addition to the video is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy the fast and floating party.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less handy users.
Once you're over this level, you can get into "second car" at levels that are more convenient this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or such that has an effect only on the depth of action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not to listen to optical clomas".
This new approach to Super Maria in 3D also proposes a return to the transfer console that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video Nintendo is playing in notes to those who follow the story and repeat the successful formulas from the past. It is the fact that the installment of the female husband will have to go through dangerously modified platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motions, around, in moves, and among enemies, Luigi also appears to be “food”.
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps to issue an ex-President, Alfonso Portilla, who is in the United States to respond from the savings of $70 million.
This is the end of the process aimed at Guatemala responding to the request of the northern country, which requires the issue of Portilla so that it can be judged.
At the press conference, Columbus confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and that he remembered that the court had already ordered the execution.
He made sure that during his term of office, he "did not intervene" in court decisions and allowed all the publications that he had received on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and serious health injuries and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The steps of the column shall mean the step of execution after all judicial and constitutional proceedings have been taken to initiate the proceedings against the former President, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was chased innocently by a total of 120 million troops to the Ministry of Defence during his presidency, but the Ministry of Public Affairs withdrew and returned the case to the game.
Trinijo helped 6,000 young people in the threat situation
The organization has made it possible to help children without education not to be killed at the expense of society.
The first 25 years' balance of the existence of Trinija's social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people who have threatened social exclusion have received help.
To that end, it is necessary to count the long number of jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
The previous year also served to represent a balance sheet within the framework of the glorious Act, which took place in the former manufacturing spaces of Fabra and Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
Triniov's organisation was established in the fourth Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, dependent on drugs or in situations where they might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andre took place with a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who have worked together with their associations for the past 25 years.
The various political representations, at the time of the elections, showed a single character of work that Trini's work is being carried out.
Together with President Generalitat, Arturem Masem, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujolem, participated in the glorious Act with former socialist educator Ernest Maragall, and former deputy of the age and current ecological-socialist working Richard Goma.
Fabra and Coats were also provided with a contemporary advisor for the Social Welfare and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the general social work director at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mass said that Trini was in a very difficult time and that today's time is also a series of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good basis".
The President pointed out to Trini as an example of how it is possible to fight against unremitting circumstances and how to give people courage in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There's been a house in which giant parties were arranged
Firefighters rented 11 of 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 people left the house yesterday morning without having to rest.
It all points to the fact that the night measure that the neighbors of Number 51 were living in the Balmes street is finally over.
Twelve people left the building illegally last Sunday and where they organized giant parties that were built by neighbors, left the building out of the court regulation and would not have to hide the police.
After the completion of the operation, the lock on the doors was replaced to prevent the recovery of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be monitored," the manager said.
The contractors who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest of the building - took all electrical and partly water equipment, and left behind all kinds of wastes, especially after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted for up to two days and other tenants.
According to the building, the discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that during the time the building was occupied, the markets closed by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque stresses that the builders made it a little competitive because they sold wines for 3 euros, which is 10 euros on the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of neighbors about the noise. However, the problems did not cause visitors of the discotheques, but the residents of the house, and in particular those who attended the festivals, whose frequency and intensity in the last weeks grew according to the locals.
The discotheque owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building that he would let her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that over the last few weeks, she had more problems with neighbors than she did at the time.
The President of the City Group of the People's Party of the PP at the workshop, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week that "the building should be immediately removed and end with the problems of civil relations which the neighbors suffer and the destruction of the area".
The president explained that only one income was banned before the year, but in recent months the occupations reached all the houses and almost all the houses, and one of them even became a thief.
In this direction, he added that "it must be done with carelessness and be consistent if it comes to the effects of civil liability that has come to the building".
Yesterday, the city police also destroyed the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours, 30 minutes the police arrived at the building 35 on the Mont-ral street after they called her neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects met on the occasion of writing a deal that would bring more than a complaint against the donors.
The City Election Board for 16 branches is reopening the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, in the time of the largest development, Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-regulatory company has published several pamflettes in support of the Collserola Park.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
More than that, he was complemented by numerous comparisons with the New York Central Park.
After the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan Metropolis is one of the small ones that do not focus on the north axis - they, but up (hor) - down (sea).
Collseroly's qualifications as a natural park are going this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlings instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September when the workshop announced a competition of 16 competitions created on the same number of entry branches to Collseroly.
The defense of course plays a lot better in the thinking of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put a gun in the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competitions, both in terms of the clean organisation, and on the basis of the city's reflection, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architectures.
It is already the same theme as if two members of this old caste were hand-held at a meeting in the auction.
And that's what he called one of the common accords between the three Barcelona architects and the famous university professors.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayon: the selection procedure has its derogation.
According to Rolanda, after the question of the seabed side, "there is a need to discuss "the mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerda's appearance of green apples has not been applied to the end.
"We must depart from the principle that the most brightest Barcelona park is the beach.
Except for their great availability.
Collserola is more complex," declared an architect, for which the name "branch to Collserola" in itself is "lexical paste": we must not represent them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation zone where possible".
The model, like Roland and Bayon, with experience from urbanism, qualifies the proposal as a "intelligent challenge" referring to "some danger".
It is dangerous because of the "uncertainty that represents the project of a public place today" after the 80s experience that was in the Forum's area of "his labyrinth of music".
The first concern is the only restriction of borders where it should be established.
"Something means doing another step already," it's basically taking the next step.
"The new urban and planning tools need to be remembered because they can cause real confusion in the current (with reference to the General Metropolis Plan (GPM)".
If we focus on the question more detail, Modol is thought to be able to "consider for the park", but the Barcelona section is nothing, and for the sake of pure topographicals.
The model also pointed out that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, who "does not end up in the garbage", even though he welcomes the fact that the workshop offers his game that he will be involved in the project from "first time".
And it also understands that the proximity of mountains and cities is like a failure that allows architects to engage in debate, but "disquiets", that it should be just this technical profile that leads the multidisciplinary team ("it's all about skill"), which should be created: "Architecturals should be only tools".
The Bayona points out that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because, in the context of the selection process, the Collserola's global vision is missing: "There have been 16 electoral controls that all the people of the mountains - the sea, but there is no partial study that would look at and understand the area as a whole."
As a result, at least he joined in all 16 election proceedings.
Otherwise, the same project can build on the concept and definition of the architecture of the neighbouring branch.
According to his opinion, the workshop should guarantee that the bridge located directly above the Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire area of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino superior to Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legally empowered Cadino Red granted the mercy of the elder of Monterrey's brother in a process in which he had been subjected to deliberate exploitation.
Manuel Jonas Larrazabal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legally empowered Casino Red handed him mercy before the Second Criminal Court, which had ruled the case of excavating, in which he was charged with the murder of the late Monterrey's brother.
After an interview with Casino Royale owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask for payment of economic quotas so that a workshop in Monterrey would allow illegal operations in the house of Sazko.
Following a public complaint, the State prosecutor began a criminal prosecution of the Panistic Age brother. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agency, number 3 for property offences was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital city.
At this point, the following 49 days after the second Regulation was introduced, the public ministry's agent was able to cooperate or organize a crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyt court for suspecting the execution of the owner of Casina Red part one and a half million pesos. However, he remained in prison for only a few hours with a very serious investigation because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay at the city hall in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who announced that there had been a collection of evidence that would enable Jonah’s wine to be shown. For example, the evidence included payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for admission to the operation.
This afternoon, the legally defeated Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecinov and asked for mercy for the older brother of the region. On the basis of this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the representatives of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the partners had decided to grant mercy.
On the basis of the official letter 197/2011, the legal mercy of Jonas Larsaábal is granted. In the process he was accused of, it will not be possible to impose any hardship. It is also possible to apply for damage or punishment.
After a legal appeal of approximately 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of the Larrazabal Breton.
The secret officer of the court, Jorge Yanez, was sent to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and that his case had been sent to the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate regulation on his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácomo presented details of the air accidents involving the death of the secretor of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The communication and transport secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of an accident investigation by a secret officer of the government of Francisco Blake Mora and seven others indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground by a full force without the pilot being able to try to accept the assignment.
At the Dionisio Pérez Jácome Press conference, a secretary for Communication and Transport, indicated that before the start of the flight, the pilot found that climate conditions allow flight.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit has come several times to contact the ground, the wings have slipped into the wind of trees 25 metres from the place where the unit has lost the body."
He also informed that the unit had been appointed for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, it stated that on the basis of the survey carried out in the field of observation, no shares were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that the parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft was born on the ground as celestial.
"The gardener was appointed for 19 persons, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
Terén is showing himself with seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary made sure that it is now the most important thing to get the fastest results. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director-general of the airport and auxiliary services, announced that at the moment of the President-General's vote, the flight speed had moved and the accident had taken place on the soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis that in times of an accident, there was an ordinary flight operation," he said.
At the press conference of the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome mentioned six basic research points:
Year of vision:
In accordance with flight rules, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of the flight, i.e. the crew must be seen on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the adequate conditions at the start, and according to this aircraft, the route to the border, between DF and the State of Mexico have been dark in low altitudes.
Allowed tracks:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to Cuernavac's valley.
Location of the moment.
It is likely that there has been no loss of control or failure of the flight trajectory before the crash.
Distinct of remaining aircraft on restricted territory:
The information we have currently available enables us to assume that there has been an equal train and on the side.
The extent of the remainder of the aircraft's questioning indicates that at the time of the attack, the cell temperature was stable.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence of an explosion or fire has been recorded at the site of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation show that it was possible to reach several contacts with certainty.
During field work, the remaining aircraft was found at altitudes up to 9200 degrees above sea level, the ground is considered to be higher than the ceiling from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show the traps that probably occurred along the tracks mentioned.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the receiver could be contacted in a number of places.
After a thorough patrol in the environment, on the territory that is larger than the territory of the escape area, there was no trace of the vertigo, which reinforces the belief that the damage occurred when the vertigo was still Celestial.
The Mexican health insurance institution has started a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research with the aim of discovering the gene responsible for obese children and adults.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research with the aim of detecting a gene causing obesity in children and young people. A study called "Genetic obese in children and adolescents" will enable you to obtain the results related to obesity.
In the report of the Scientific Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the National Medical Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, survivors and social workers was established.
This team is supported by experts and postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Research and Advanced Studies Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The public can also be involved in research. People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will run every 8 hours of youth tests.
He stressed that the research started in the Sports Centre Cuahtémoc (Mexico) and since 8 October this activity is also carried out in the Sport Centre Nezahualcoyolt (Mexico State East).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Centre of Independence (right from the Federal District) and finally in the Sports Centre of Morelos (nor north from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the factors and the importance of genetics, in terms of the development of obesity, and to expose the risk factors of Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the goal of gathering data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 was to agree and, under the supervision of parents, to apply specific life questions.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and the family history of parental disabilities with a view to avoiding risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He pointed out that each Saturday all participants are subjected to anthropometric measurements ( weight, height, flow), blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin, and genes are determined (to identify genes that are part of the child's obesity).
Cruz López indicated that this research reflects the concern of doctors over the alarming growth of children’s weight.
'The health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had a 77% increase in obesity and 47% in girls. The dramatic growth also occurred in case of obesity,' said an expert from the IMSS.
He pointed out that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the belief that the population of the country is different from the rest of the population of its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexicoan has 65% Indian-American genetics, 30% European and 5% Africans. This reality is reflected in genes responsible for the incidence of diabetes and obesity.
He explained that obesity is generally explained as an inability to fuel excess energy that we consume (calorie) and that occurs in the form of fluids.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will be given a full assessment of the status of children, which will determine whether they have any knowledge of obesity or obesity.
He indicated that even the presence of a dark color (acantosis) on the skin and the premixture indicates the likelihood that this individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-circular conditions.
Information is still reliable, doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that they have to make in order to avoid illness for their children.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause stress, anxiety and other chronic illness: a seven-way life - style that is characterized by a lack of daily physical activity, a full day's sitting before television and the use of transport resources rather than a short distance away.
It also causes great caloric intake, which is greater consumption of low drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high levels of tobacco and protein and genetic fat, which is the subject of this research.
No requests will be made in Asphalt with UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemicals Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture of better function, depending on climate conditions and temperature
If it had been properly planned for landing, almost 200 thousand claims should not be fixed after each period of duties in the metropolitan area of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty (FQ), who also added that if construction and maintenance of asphalt landings were adequate, there would have been significant restrictions on claims or could even be completely removed.
In his presentation, the technological cause of the damage caused by the International Year of Chemistry announced that a laboratory under its control develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture of similar characteristics such as as as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both in low and high temperatures.
Herrera Najera is thought to be able to use this type of modified asphalt in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. It would improve the functionality and reduce the creation of claims.
He explained that asphalt, the most difficult part of the oil, is the collection of carbon molecules, the molecule with a large molecular mass called asphaltenes, and the others with a low molecular mass called maltens.
The viscosity of asphalt starts in that it acts as liquid at about 180 degrees, at 120 degrees with high viscosity, and at 50 degrees is almost in steady state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to slow down, added.
This means that the absence of asphalt in the streets is not unique, but changes are made during days according to weather conditions and temperature, warning experts on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Chemical Faculty observed that most streets in Ciudad de Mexico are covered by a flexible debt that consists of six types of materials, of which three are combined with asphalt.
Among the top species is the asphalt compound, made of small stones in the asphalt and then crushed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes the tape is to be swallowed with asphalt.
When driving a car or when making a pressure, it is so possible that they are able to make a good deal of it.
If it's about a modified asphalt, it would be even better distributed, a chemical engineer is thought to be.
He added that the last species called the beach, made of stone, will be placed on the asphalt floor, and also sanded in the asphalt.
Given that this type will come into contact with the vehicle frame, it must have a mechanical power greater than the asphalt input and must ensure that the vehicle is driven.
In view of the fact that a large amount of debt will be incurred as part of the loan, there must be enough load and attention must be paid to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that should be remembered. Especially water has a major impact on the function of asphalt.
Once the ground is wet, the water spreads inside and is difficult to get out, it causes all kinds of leaks to melt and thus cause damage.
He explained that during the creation of claims, the film was the first to destroy the plate and then to damage the asphalt entries. But it is not at one point, but it is a process that should be stopped by the first signs of the appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Experts, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of claims, and that the burden of each type of loan must meet the requirements of the vehicles and must be assured that the burden is not too high.
Rafael Herrera warned that when it comes to asphalt, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research to begin. For example, there are asphalt emulsions that are already available in other countries and are able to easily fix demands without using high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to reach Miss Colombia.
That's how Valle gets 14th title first multiple.
Valle del Cauca failed again to reach Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to calm down by appearing on the winning floor, getting a silver ring and a sleigh, on the basis of which a new first anniversary of Colombia was made.
On the basis of the results of the previous final in Cartagena, where she won and won Miss Atlántico, mentioned by the department, won the 14th prize. Melina joined with the supporters of the women from Valle del Cauca who had won the winning race, but were eventually declared the first winner. Among them is Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Barnedo (1990), Daniels Giuldo (1990)
It's a question that many people are willing to ask.
As a result, the defeat of the great favor that has shown in all previous streets that it is about to become a new Miss Colombia, not to become the Royal Police, and the most noble form of Joel de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who have followed up with the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only the First Multiple is the fact that she did not give her answer to the question: "What book did you like most and why?", by Martin Murillo Gómez from the Literary edition of Leamos.
The applicant answered the question:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most affected me in childhood was "Little prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nimirovski, Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this response was not popular because of the term "culturalization" and the second reason why the candidate did not explain why the individual cited books were present.
After the end of the celebration, Melina announced that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise in what is going to happen.
And you people, read, if you can, a little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheticals is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
The Bogotic journalist pointed out that from the beginning the candidate was the most popular, the most respected, and the one who brought all the previous prices (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), raised the interest of other artists, and raised the queen, who then burned on the scene.
This was apparent during the first presentation of the sailor on the Hilton beach and during two previews before the final crowning.
Even though she was on both sides, she was aware of her lack of strength and was impressed by the presence of representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the Canal RCN's "As Home" program, believes that Melenda's getting the title of the first multiples confirms the fact that the candidate who receives the most titles during the contest will not finally go out with the King's crown".
In addition, Valle had become more vulnerable to the media in recent days and had not paid for it.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Competition for Beauty.
On the other hand, two days before the election, the international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty, indicated that they were looking for a woman who would know the social needs of her country.
"In the competition Miss Colombia the beauty itself is not enough, there is a need to see something more than the physical beauty. It is important to focus on the social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects even before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also reflected in the fact that the candidate Valle lost his points because of the shortcomings of his background and fibrosis, which were on the back. But it is entirely in conflict with the jury's verdict, which selected her Miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper survival and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body here that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the roof, which I think was not very well known, were picked up by the bottom until the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine is believed to have made a mistake when she made several surgical steps.
"Cyrrhythmias are all right, but they didn't tell them in Valle.
The body was never her strong side, and here you chose your tax."
Because of this assessment, which was first made by the National Assembly of Beauty, after a look at the flowers, came to a severe warning that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the comfort that Raymondo Melin’s efforts to prevent her from finally making the highest turn.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that today Melina has begun her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that allows her to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded as one of the kings who, despite the successful Cartagena, failed to reach the highest rank.
So was the work of the Cali, who identified Alphonse Cana's dead.
Cali's fingerprint expert went into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfons Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th of last year, a press expert from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader of Farc: "Alfonse Cana", which is by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week was a row at Eliazar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he had to spend more than five days selling rice in order to get to the place where the dead had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and, after completing the appropriate courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This knowledge is used in the skin training study, then hand and foot.
In the week when the surgery was carried out against Alphonse Canov, Eliazar said to take his clothes at least for three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went out to Cauca in the tower of Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead people and that he suspects that one of them was a man who led the oldest soldier in the world, so he was asked to take a map with the fingerprints of Guillerma Leon Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where she was found, he didn't recognize her because of the physical appearance.
He had no hair, he was dressed like a village in the given area, without glasses, much safer.
But the prints don't.
Along with the gallton lamp, the artist and the transplanter and the light Eliezer began to compare the dactyl records of the dead with the records from the cards.
It didn't say it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejad was entrusted with the charge of the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirming whether he was truly the highest leader of Farc.
Looking up the step
For a doctor from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that the president of the Santos, Eliazar, showed at the press conference of operational services against "Canovi" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscope is accurate knowledge, without the possibility of errors that can play a key role in the decision of criminal acts.
In addition to identifying the dead, these people help in investigating criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the victims.
When they are caught, many dealers present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll get them fingerprints and find them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a bullet inside the house because the thief was working on this site to remove the treasure full of spices and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to take prints, but in this case we could get prints full of hands and identify the painters who participated in several thefts," he said.
The fingerprints may also confirm or reverse suspicions in the case of murder.
Before long, a dead man was found with the arms of alcohol around him.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for murder and that the pressure on the arm actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be confirmed by the fact that he was a real murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
The expert on fingerprints from the CTI explained that the prints are "stirred by chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, the transplanter or sand shall be used for their selection.
Then prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of dealers, or to the Register.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians who have never been informed of their data," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as indicated in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that's going on, it's not gold, it's not everything you touch, there's still feet.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Disgusting" protested in New York
The mobs of demonstrators pushed themselves to Zuccotti's place where they wanted to be.
A large part of them were waiting for an order to cross the area and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Consadjte Wall Street were excommunicated in New York on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan by court order, where they had been released this morning. Then they tried to take another New York Park.
The mobs of demonstrators pressed into Zuccotti's place, where they wanted to get the court order, which allows the "crazed" to return to the place. The second part of the party responded to the crossing by taking the park to the north of the city, where it came to another detention.
"If the court won't allow us to return to the place, we'll sit in another place and continue in a legal battle with the goal of returning to Zuccotti, and as through the assembly, such peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers "Ossadham Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray confirmed that the response to the "disgusting" camp ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent movement of the places and allowed protesters to stay here.
In addition to the "distortion" they took another park located on the cruisers of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the ground floor of the Trinity Church.
At least in an hour they were able to take a place, but then the police came and held some protesters.
The organization ensures that several hundred people have sat on the ground, and the delegation of religious representatives has come to express their support and to try to communicate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti, who is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to be held on Tuesday, and during which the legality of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced protesters even broke down and distributed copies of the court order and even handed it to the officials who watched the site, which caused "some small shootings", reported Bray, who condemned the fact that some police protesters were.
The court order prohibits the issuing of the members of the "Occupa Wall Street" or the use of "laws published after the beginning of the party, or prohibiting demonstrators from accessing the park with the trade or other places they previously used".
Old Bloomberg pointed out for the press that, in view of this court order, the city ceased to open the public area again and the protesters warned that local laws did not allow them to return to the state and the premises.
The city's highest representative personally defended the early deployment of Zuccotti, an operation where 200 persons were detained and to which they were admitted because the demonstrators "disregarded the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the city because it became "a place where people were not going to protest, but to break the laws and, in some cases, to approach others", because "some businesses got extraterrestrial letters" and "the neighbors were afraid about the quality of their lives".
"The morning shift was clear and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests for the American working people," added a spokesman, who accused the old man of "not thinking of freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Occupa Wall Street" also indicated that they are planning to organize "great action" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organisations to commemorate two months after which they are protesting.
Pamela Anderson will present Ms. Marie on a special summer television show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a sailor in "Bywatch", a playboy in "Playboy", a wife of the annual singer Tommy Lee, and now the hero and model will be Pannoa Marie in a special evening series of Canadian television.
The private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, together with a song of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will be cheering Ms. Marie.
CTV has today shown interest in a television program in which Anderson, also known from the Internet’s home pornography photos, appeared with his ex-husband, Mötley Crée, Tommy Leem, as a nun who is in her role as Jesus.
As Josef appears on the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently became the moderator of the tournament "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Apart from Anderson and Peters, the special evening broadcast of CTV reveals a Canadian song of Bublé, which at the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisano Lopilato, which is close to the controversy.
Recently Bublé called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York's "liski".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of floods that began in March
Since March of last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, and now it is suffering from a devastating earthquake that has grown in the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War 2.
The first estimates were estimated at $300 million in material losses, a wound that despite the difficult world situation.
After three quarters of payments, the value of the GDP between the July and September reached such a position that it was possible to round the site with the final payment: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also predict the maximum rate of growth compared with the winter to the summer of 2010.
Renewals can be partially explained by buying machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas of destroyed soils and subsequent tsunamis.
The deficits increased their investment by 1.1%, spending at 0.9% sales during the ice-to-morning period. This is the first drop after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real threat of the Japanese economy is largely from the impulse to use the crisis to get out of it, or to re-infrastructure, and that is to use the lack of it to start with zero.
In particular, Japan has developed domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This change increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
New Stigma
This was believed in the internal market when the Japanese currency became one of the "saving values" for investors who escaped from the debt crisis in the euro area and from the disturbing US forecasts. It is a privilege which is at the same time a major burden for export companies.
With a stronger exchange, the foreign products are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony read their weak results in July up to September just another course.
While the markets continue to expand the borders of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda's government is clear.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of again," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, perspectives are never exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has confirmed that most Member States have shown clear signs of economic downturn.
The indicator predicting world economy instability showed that the economy of major powers is declining.
It fell by four decades at 100.4 points to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even reached an average of 100. It has reached a level of 99.13 points.
Athenian again spreads insecurity
Papadimos says they'll be approved for resistance measures, but the conservators don't sign a written commitment
With the rapid and risk-opportunity guarantees and the uncertainty that once again prevailed, Greece continues to be lured into the labyrinth leading to the exit of a major debt crisis in Europe.
The view that the "shoda" of the new transitional Greek government is giving the requirements of Brussels more than the real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period that he received at his appointment will probably be shorter for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new opposition measures would not in any case be supported and repeated his request for a new vote on the proposed date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit on 26 October," Papadimos announced yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will raise a vote on the government's confidence tomorrow.
The package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax deficits will be among the first initiatives.
However, the report of Samaras never explains any doubts as to his existence: "We were committed to the aid of the Transitional Government, but we were no longer committed to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went a little further in his speech to the EU and the IMF, which should block 8 billion which Athens urgently needs, but also stated that he does not support and sign any commitment to the implementation of the anti-competitive measures.
The European Commission has already been resolved by the accident caused by Papandre's toys with the referendum yesterday that its requirements are inexhaustible: it does not block any aid if the new government and representatives of the main parties do not sign "a written commitment without duality and what may be first".
Speaking for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj explained that inspectors from Troy will return "very fast" to Athens and will meet with the new government about what "needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek crew has a little bit more of what it's going to be like.
Royal Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Royal Council welcomes the excellent position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
King Sophie reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet, as regards this instrument of cooperation, which is the essence of "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on human confidence".
The Queen of the World Summit in Valladolid concluded yesterday that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals to achieve a reduction in the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, thus with a share of poverty".
Spain's "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in every corner of the planet and take this task responsible", the Queen of Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will take place until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are primarily determined by these loans.
"We've reached a lot" and "a lot of challenges are still ahead of us."
The concept of microchips should be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "the basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal was to have 175 million poor families access these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million families would be able to cope with the current poverty.
The concept of a microshop was extended to Spain and other states of the world after "what came out of Muhammad Yunus's mind on this road," the king stated and added that one "of the law of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this tool as "a wonderful idealist who went out on the road to fight poverty." He met with his work 15 years ago when he went to Bangladesh to meet him directly at his place of employment.
After this experience, the first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in the Slovene Border in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "I was able to see the steady development of all these meetings, explained the queen who, thanks to her support for this project, served yesterday the title "father of the poor" in Valladolid.
Queen Sofia concluded her presentation by calling on the participants to engage in discussion and to seek solutions and thus enable them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is a ethical imperative", which must be directed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be wrong to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balocity, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez is believed to represent a "serious and positive policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow for even solidarity to become a sacrifice.
For Spain, micro-enterprises are one of the main development cooperation lines.
National Secretaries for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on our confidence in the people who all others are closing the door. Old Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city who "opens their defenses of solidarity which is binding".
The CDU proposes the election of the European President on the basis of general voluntary law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and President, the Christian Democratic Party of Angel Merkel went through the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) convention on Monday 14 November in Lipsku.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the programme, but it was at the bottom of it, in particular in order to bring peace to the members of the government who are considering the government's policy against the Russians and perhaps tomorrow against Italians for Latin.
The proposal concerning the European Commission's leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegations were voting.
A few minutes ago, the sheep came to the conclusion of Angely Merkel's appearance and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European minister of finance, left room for doubts.
The main opinion of the Chancellor and the proposal can be included in the report: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "9 million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the Member States of the euro area, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general voluntary law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposals adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is very unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom will stand against it and the leading CDU representatives will think that we will take the same position as Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is out.
In the same way, delegates have prevented a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's representation, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously arise in strengthening Germany's weight.
An elderly man who managed to calm the climate inside his party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmuta Kohl. She did not try to get a convention about the "small" European states or about the countries that are in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Perhaps the proposal on Europe is a reflection of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel of France did not feel.
It's just not straight.
When she recalled that just two thousand years ago, she had a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most devastating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does a fraud represent when it comes to work incapacitating?
Following the aid, the UMP party and the government are committed to an abuse against labour incompatibility.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the topic of combating social obstacles and redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a result of this abuse, which comes out of the desire to take action in the context of increased presence, but it is not less clear from the view of the legal presidential campaign, the majority of them want to focus on labour incapacity.
First of all, because of the budgetary support, the government will intend to introduce the private sector employees on the fourth day of unemployment before they start to receive aid in difficulty.
It is clear that without agreement, an employee who is ill would have lost four days of nursing, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measures that risk causing a lot of blood, but which, according to the list of Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
The measures would also be implemented by other measures of the symbolic approach: to give public employees one day the unrecorded disability (they have no capacity to sell for three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the majority of the legal burden is also the subject of fraud, which is currently focused on the abuses associated with labour incapacity.
"The controls will be much more extensive and: if you are reached, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned during the interview with the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification are sometimes considered to be unreasonably due to the fact of injustice in the workplace.
These were in fact the subject of continued monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruit.
The French are not more ill than others in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse national d'assurance disease (CNAM - national health insurance) more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Medical Research and Documentation, in 2008, daily remuneration was EUR 11.3 billion, representing 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% were affected by maternal contributions and labour impacts and 54% by occupational disability, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, France had an average of 14.5 working days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The extent to which it conceals certain derogations: another survey published in 2007 on sites with job opportunities Monster.com showed that 75% of the French employees interviewed replied that they did not choose any day of the job in question.
Another study, carried out by the non-capital insurance institutions, found that in 2010 37.8% of job failures were shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months, and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no more than temporary workers.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absences (for health reasons or nothing) increased in France between 10% and 11.8% compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of job failures, only a very small part of the job is sold into black.
If it's about dividends, they're just a small amount.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls aimed at job incapacitating more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that 13.8% of 285,000 short-term non-adjusted or too long-term controls were conducted in 1.5 million cases, i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematic incompatibility over 45 days, 11% of "unadjusted or not justified" cases were calculated at 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
At the same time, 169 000 "unrightful" cases were imposed on a number of millions of employees who were incapacitated.
The number that represents much less than the number that indicates work on black.
According to UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the Red Paper on this issue, this figure would represent between 9 and 15 billion euros missing in the year's selection of taxes, i.e. more than the total amount of daily wages and thus, ultimately, more than the doubts associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday 14 December, the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, brought those words to Parliament and added that the unit will not be able to fulfil this task in one hundred days.
"To restore our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new saved budget," said the head of government when he made his first public statement in the beginning of a debate on confidence in Parliament.
The payment of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone Summit will be "the main task" of the new governments, as our country has added its share in the euro area.
As a result, Mr Papadimos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "about 9%" of the gross domestic product by the end of the year after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to refuse new resistance measures
The Head of Justice Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday with a view to trying to avoid the debt crisis, but warned that his party was not bound by any additional anti-competitive measure.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measure," Samaras stressed at a meeting with the delegation on his side of the New Democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating pollution, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollima Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Mechanical Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary budget of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the proposed measure, replied that his statement is sufficient and that he did not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legislate euthanasia and self-sustained suicide, says the Committee of Experts
According to a report from the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are subject to death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cancer cases.
Canada's society lives with the idea of opening up death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive reports of the Royal Canadian Society, where six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law and medicine, were divided.
The Commission recommends that the government amend criminal law in order to allow the assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this election is necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts are quoting a recent independent agency of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 planets.
Canada may have settled in 10 places, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada has given rise to cultures in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, send us experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And with the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6 percent of them die in the hospital.
This average is payable throughout Canada, while in the province of Québec it is the highest of 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors come to the conclusion that they are against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicides do not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also given control to all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered to be a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes some abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides to persons who do not belong to or do not consent.
On the other hand, Mr Jocelyn Downie, the co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at the teleconferencing more than a few cases of these arrests just in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicides are not legalized.
"Ettanasia is also being held in Canada, where it is strictly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also taking place in Canada, where it is strictly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downney.
Canadians are forced to euthanasia
Remember, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, 85% of Canadians have already expressed interest in euthanasia because they believe that people can ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send a message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have a lower price.
In the case of persons practicing the assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
In matters of maintenance or withdrawal of care for the patient, the situation is clearer, reports the authors.
The list of recommendations also proposes that a derogation from a treatment for which a legally approved refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for professional doctors to be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final injections already widely used in Canadian medical devices, the Commission requires that it be considered at a time when it is no longer suitable for the reduction of physical disease, for euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Awards of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their views on the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical lawyer, qualified the position of experts and signatories of the news as "extreme" despite others because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation when everyone who would have been forced to live and who should have been able to ask for more than 18 years to help him escape suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied a summary of the news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also asserts that it seems as if the authors of the reports have established individuals' autonomy over all the other values that create society's social advantage.
Because "in society, he says, there are alert signs and restrictions."
Specialist for Medical Law Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong intentions for the conclusions of the report which she qualified as "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly concerned about data on the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
The Jordan King calls President Assad to withdraw
Damaszek talks about "compute"
Syria is still more isolated
Stoupens Bashar al-Assad had protested yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures were intensified on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, gives them and speaks of "the whole" against his country.
Two days after the cessation of Syria's membership in the Arab States, the European Union lifted its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring country with Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday, who called President Bashar al-Assad to kill in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of military forces were killed, "beyond the power".
"If Bashar had the interests of his country in his heart, he would have to delegate, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a country with Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
On his side, the chief of the Turkish diplomat, Ahmet Davutoglu, stated that the efforts of the Turkish sworn mediation in the Syrian business regime since the beginning of the year had not been corroded by success.
"Those who don't live in peace with their people in the Middle East and can't calm them down and leave them," declared the attack on neighboring Syria, while Turkey applies the stronger line.
The United States benefited from 'enforcement of the consensus against Assad and unfair conduct of the Syrian regime' following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey continue to exert a stronger tone" against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian human rights observer, during this period, 16 civilians and 19 members of military forces were killed in the city of Dera in southern Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilian persons "with shootings and targeted shootings from heavy bullets in the city of Jobar" in the area of Homs.
At the press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall concluded that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
In recent years he has also reacted to the decision of the League of Arab States to stop the Danish Membership, which, according to him, represents a "hazardous step".
Syria's not falling apart," he added with assurance that "competences prepared against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to stop Syria, the Member States are currently considering the League of Arab States 'the mechanism for the protection of civilians' and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppeé is also welcomely impressed by the idea of sending observers to the UN with a view to helping to protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, according to him, is "paranoid".
The new Special Meeting of the League is scheduled to arrive in Rabat on the morning of the morning to take a position on the resolution of the crisis, on which it was decided on 2 December, and in which it was intended in particular to expel the army from the city of armed conflict and release the imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lavrov considered yesterday's decision by the League of Arab States to be "missed", while China expressed its intention to take action against Syria to resolve the crisis, but then it fully supported the appropriate sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifice after Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for a little time to form his team and start applying a program that would include "victim" with the aim of regaining credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before today the representatives of the committee and the employees met.
It should set up a relatively smooth cabinet composed of technologies that do not belong to Parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a messenger of one of the several parliamentary groups in the discussion following a meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
President Gianfranco Fini expects that Mario Monti will ask Parliament to speak out of confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation ends with the presentation of the 12 ministers of President Giorgi Napolitan to the small team.
Mario Monti commented on nervousness in the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "Democraticism pays exact terms" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and reasonable".
His appointment to the president was welcomed at first, but the concern was renewed after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team that includes in particular technology, although he stressed that he would also like to adopt a "political" policy.
He expressed his conviction that the new government would remain until 2013, i.e. the date of next elections.
According to President Gianfranca Fini, the new government will receive Parliament's trust in the flag.
Mario Monti promised after his entry into office that he would deal with an extraordinarily urgent situation and with the aim of becoming a strong member of Europe again.
The speaker of European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change with the new government."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the opposition plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is the same as the 2013 budget, and calls for new strong measures.
The head of the business union of Konfindustria Emma Marcegagliov, who meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "or a country that does not show growth cannot meet the weak parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolised by the authors of the "relevant call" and "Italia's new", represents Italy's "regardal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The time of his team's life will be unknown to a great stranger.
President Napolitano would like to make an early election, as Italy has to place a national debt of EUR 200 billion by April 2012.
The Soviet scientist helped the Iranian nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko has helped Iran develop a detonator that is useful for nuclear weapons, announced in the United States' third-party non-governmental organization specialized in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) shall describe the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents unique to this UN agency.
Last week MAAE reported its "severe anxiety" on the "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS, the wide range of MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (No. 1934) should have been working for three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural), where the production of synthetic diamonds was to be stopped by the explosive method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave a medium term to establish a company producing "nano-diamanty" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company were to bring him into contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was then to work on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In his last report, MAAE recalls "the clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" came from the work of a foreign specialist who was not only aware of this method, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked during the essential part of its career in this technology under the country's military nuclear programme where it comes from".
Anti-Ministerial Crimes and Delicacy Rated 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of criminal acts and offenses aimed at Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while the other racial and religious violence was either slow or slow.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase in the violence against Catholics by 13%, 4% in the persecutions against the Jews and 14% in anti-Semitic criminal acts and deliberations.
The total number of 'enemyable criminal acts' was very light to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the fall in 2009, it is exciting to see these criminal acts and the delinquent acts again," the Human Rights First organization stressed, "the incidence of anti-temple violence is particularly important," added the organization in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the leading actors of the organization Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, and he assumes that this could lead to an improvement in police reporting on hate crimes."
"An enemy criminal act" in American federal law is the era of civil rights struggle.
This rule was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and looks more Facebook
The website providing microblogging services Twitter introduced changes on Monday in design to enable its users to monitor the activities of the successors, which somehow compares her service to Facebook.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow you to know better and directly the activities of other people who are watching you or people whose answers (tweets) are following you.
This allows them to know whether they are able to monitor contributions, whether they are eligible for new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new form of Twitter was tested "in August by a small percentage of users" before it was expanded across the network on Monday, AFP spokeswoman Twitter Carolyn Penner said.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms that were somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated expansion of someone else's contribution, followfreeday for recommendation de follow-up and other user) making the bonheur des initiatives, also opens up a wider audience with a more comparable management than that of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network users immediately take the importance of this innovation into their "tweets" differently.
"It's essential, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function of the activity will help me to follow some of the elements of my Twitter," he wrote @dannykronstrom.
Rakuusko
recording of the Golden Rule on the same budget in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Rakouska, decided on Tuesday to sign the "gold Rule" budgetary policy to the constitution with a view to reducing public deficits and avoiding any reduction in the evaluation of Rakouska by rating agencies (AAAA).
It was the only social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Ministerial Council in a situation where the Iraqi public debt is 74.6% higher than the maximum criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Rakouska's solvency had been reduced by only one step from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay every year three billion euros more," the Foreign Minister and Christian Democrat Michael Spindeleger argued.
Thus, Austria refers to the application of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that public deficits and the achievement of the balance of public accounts should be reduced by the end of 2012.
The tool adopted by the Russian government is closer to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017 the public structural deficit will have to be reduced every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) and starting in 2017 the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while the country of the country, as well as its citizens, will have to show the same budget.
The objective is to obtain public debt in the year 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong only
The node threatens new intervention on foreign markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to engage again in foreign markets if they were to continue in the strengthening process.
"We'll figure out how we've done this lately, if we're going to find too much instability" in the changing course of one, he explained to the Senate of Y. Noda.
On Tuesday only he re-entered the historical values, which were brought to the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day Tokyo sold only for dollars to lower the value of Japanese currency, which had recently exceeded the record against a dollar worth since 1945.
But since then, it has been regularly supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe haven" in the uncertain times of the world's economic downturn and the European crisis caused by debt.
On Tuesday, the dollar was reimbursed under 77 yens and the euro was thrown under the symbol card 105 yen closer to the level that had been issued by the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, he had a dollar worth of around 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This plans Japan's exchanges damage to island exports, as it reflects the price of Made and Japan products and reduces the value of the profits obtained by Japanese companies from foreigners when they transfer them to domestic exchanges.
"Japan is sinking" because of the drought caused by coastal earthquakes and floods, which caused the Tohoku region to move north-east, highlighted Y. Noda, who is afraid that the earthquake would not have been killed by the Greeks' eggs.
The third economic power of the world was renewed in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) and this was first in one year due to the study of export growth and household consumption of the affected disasters.
But the Prime Minister argued that the high value was no longer reflected in the "national economy of Japan".
The Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which began in the second two-day meeting of its Political and Monetary Council to take all possible measures leading to the weakening of the Union.
But this multi-governmental institution Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that BoJ had already adopted "parent measures" indicating that no additional exchange deficits could be expected in the medium.
At its last meeting at the end of the final session, the price paper issue had increased by 5000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) its purchases of state co-financed bonds and increased by 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the share of the shares that contributed to the purchase of various securities with a view to carrying liquids.
Eurozone:
The scales are falling, the winds are falling
The risk of the debt crisis continues to be covered by European indicators.
Through the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to grow.
Europe's storms are still worried about the stability of the euro area today, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 hours CAC 40 index loss 1.4% on 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new incentives around the profits from the loans of the euro area countries that are in difficulty, and still markets with shares worldwide are only part of the recent gains."
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of addiction," explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets, quoted by Reuters agency.
The storm in Tokyo has been reduced by 0.7%, which has endured due to concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the change will only continue in the difficult range of variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized," Missushige Akino, manager of funds at Ichiyoši Investment Management, estimates.
This recurrence of uncertainty over the future of the euro area damages the euro area itself, which continues in its decline on Tuesday.
The euro shall be reached at the lowest level from the time before the month and half.
At 10 hours the European currency is $1,3570 at the rate of 0.4%.
According to the painters, the change took place after the CDU Chancellor Angely Merkel's side at its Congress adopted a proposal on Monday that would allow the euro area to be removed from the countries that would arise in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish tariffs far beyond the limits 6%
Annual interest rates in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
Today, the figure of the Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85%, and the percentage of the 10-year Spanish bonds is 6.2%.
These pressures, which are due to the rise in the rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, made a serious request for a three-hour period so that he could adjust the situation in Italy to the threat of an enormous rise in its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the Eurozone summit will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is again in the target of markets when the elections are held in the country on Sunday at the parliamentary table.
The range of "spread" between the decades of German and Spanish bonds reached a new historical maximum.
In the expected number of euro area-recognition growth
Statistics show that France has reported growth in the third quarter of the economy by 0.4% due primarily to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the trend of the second quarter to the 0.1% GDP instead of the rate.
And in fact, this is the fourth quarter, which concerns the economy most.
In the same period, Germany recorded an increase of 0.5%.
First euro area estimates are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must win over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term developments or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the meeting during the elections would be an opportunity to think about such recordings and the location of energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
Meanwhile, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development is starting to double the demand for electricity by 2050 if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to save an important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to address the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity and not forget the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is the object that is currently mixed with the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case of Belgium, which underpins its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers it to be the right one only for the last generation.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with the determination of their projects.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to expand its park on one of the refurbishment of the construction of a single power plant destroyed after the accident of the three Mile Island.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is opposed.
Berlin's Volba shows the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on electricity imported especially from Russia, the rapid increase in CO2 emissions, the resulting electricity building on land and coal.
All these unpleasant effects have been on us for several months.
The case of Denmark deserves our attention.
Europe's air-conditioning campaign, which includes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest oil and gas consumers because of the irregular nature of the wind, resulting in CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher than 65%, i.e. 50% than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbor's electricity bill will pay 40% higher than the cost of paying French households.
While in the globalised energy cost economy, the key factor of competitiveness and the guarantee of the maintenance of industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most efficient electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy share would lead to a strong increase in electricity prices, which would result in an illusionous announcement of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay is essentially not against this energy, as public opinion studies show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has allowed the sector to be set up with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 jobs.
A strong export industry will attract a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises from developing jobs that cannot be transferred to a foreign market.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and come at EUR 6 billion per year, which the country will obtain for export of nuclear devices and services.
Which power owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to work for 60 years while the accident of his manufacturer is planned?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no cosy source for energy production, because there is no Devil.
The development of low CO2 emissions, nuclear power plants and renewable energy plants carried out by the French industry group AREVA is evidence of the complementability of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the absolute need to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Agency for Nuclear Security, which conducts non-compromised and transparent control over existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new electricity in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionals are recognized have a sense of safety in blood.
In the past decade, he's known the nuclear industry for three serious hazards.
The only thing that happened in Three Mile Island was in normal operation and remained without human sacrifice and consequences for the environment.
In Montenegro the drama caused the concept of the reactor and irreparable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the disaster was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude caused by the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this danger just as he did in the past two years.
The result of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR-type reactor represents the concept of being capable of delivering such eggs.
While all stakeholders wishing to set up a nuclear power plant consider it, the suspension of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered by the AREVA and EDF competitors and by allowing the road to strengthen leading positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, concepts and machines govern the debate so far as to solve the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised in various respects - police arrests, courts and administrations of a given number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", which France is proud of.
It was a recent administrative burden which was the subject of foreign students, who became current when the Minister of the Interior (see Liberation on 23 May) announced that France "needs foreign talent, walls and servers".
But it's been just a few years since it's been cut off for the economy.
I need to say that there is a large gap between left and right in this area.
In 1976, a tone went on by Jacques Chirac in his statement that "990,000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrants are found" and on the left by Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept the whole world."
The only difference is the degree of excellence
In 2005 fear of the invasion of the pride of the Polish installations on the French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are considered a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of excellence that we are going to encourage immigrants to provide.
In his programme François Holland is limited to bananas when he believes that joint development will be able to solve our "migrating problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may be paid in elections, but economics are very expensive.
How this reminds economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in their recently published part of the most recent knowledge on immigration (Excellent People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p. 352): There is a wide consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, prosperity and employment in countries where immigrants are receiving.
Restricting immigration protects growth and employment damage.
The impact of migrants is based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, in particular those less qualified, and create pressure to lower their beards.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are actually a lot more complemented by employers than French employees by performing jobs in sectors with fewer employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors which do not belong to the French employees, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not sufficient to offer a place.
Positive effects on the brain
Like a surgeon, there will be problems with work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this addition between France and migrants causes immigrants' arrivals to have a positive impact on the brain and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real borders between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants brought together contributes to the development of thinking and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were established immigrants).
In European countries, migrants are also net contributors of social systems averagely up to 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant will contribute EUR 150000 for the next 30 years to public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to come up with a missing percentage of "stupid teeth".
These teeth used to detect immigrants had a very negative effect.
Europe has found democracy, leaving a European democracy
Democracy is common and is also very Greek goods.
The European continent should bear in mind this, although it was designed in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century, the tragedy of world wars, total regimes, Holocausts, strikes, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the follicles in Greece.
Some people could believe that in order to finally triumph over their enemies, democracy will be enough to make the election and to do it the most urgent way.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General voluntary law, perhaps a condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "pressure tool" as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live in is an economic crisis, but it is just as it has been since the beginning of the political and democratic crisis.
The recognition of the faults of the Greek referendum will not be in this direction of the value of the second statement: the recognition of the need for a great return to political power, but also the recognition of the disturbing feeling of its incompatibility, its incompatibility.
This ambivalent must be thought of in order to be convinced.
It is true that the front line of democratic engagement has been moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer fighting in the right direction.
We cannot get anything if we demand a number of national rapporteurs organized according to necessity and organization.
White presented by the European absolute monarchy or the steps bound by the legs to the empty nationalist depths: what a choice for citizens!
No, we don't want gilotine knives, but common, full of justice, peaceful and uninterrupted performance of elections and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is committed to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which is suffering from its incompatibility and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe, which is undermined at the international scene.
We are disappointed in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but this is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty and with each of its peoples.
It is urgent to return to the management of the European project of democratic integrity.
Because only together will Europeans be able to lower their debt rates, free market governments and prepare for the future.
The exit from the crisis will prejudge a decision at European level that will not be able to be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will lead us to a pitfall.
After our long fight against this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
Wake up.
But think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens would be a new crazy and a new blind street.
We need to take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republic.
The revolution in the interest could not have been enough.
This lesson is going on.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will be possible only by building Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic integrity.
Let's get Europe to build Europe.
"Out of touch" chips spread
In the optimistic atmosphere, it opens in the afternoon in the Villapinte close to Paris the world's world fair of chips.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 would end by increasing the world’s trade of card with microprocessor (bank card, SIM card phone) by 11% for more than 6 billion units.
The most expensive is the non-contact technology segment, which allows you to pay in total or rent purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chips against 320 million sales a year ago!
In 2012, their share would still have to rise (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total market with chips (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the country of APEC, Europe is getting a land free of contact.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, there are more humble beginnings: 400,000 visa-free cards were issued.
But big business chains are working for two.
Carrefour spent 2.5 million contacts this year on Pass MasterCard.
To get a higher rate of speed, they need the bank to train their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distribution to their customers free banking cards in the future," says Gérard Nebouy, director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
But it's the first step to pay for the future: mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is needed to carry out transactions today with only a small number of devices.
"They've taken the delay."
"But they should come to their real divorce in the next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their world sales to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already ready.
The Bank Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in the city of Caen, which will take place from December to June next year.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 customers and employees with free communications payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And yesterday, the General Society also announced that she was preparing to make an offer that would allow her clients to pay without touching the phone.
The terrorist front of Sahary from Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the alliances between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion of the existence of alliances with the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria "has been certain of it since now".
"The way both organisations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have a similar analysis.
The investigation of two French nationals in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the linkages.
After the AQMI members were removed from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed on the same day as several of their fugitives during the operation of special French units.
In the autumns after the siege, French and Nigerian explorers had to find several telephones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to Nigeria, which has long lived in Maeduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is the village of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and a sect.
"It's a step forward, but we must certainly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect is enjoying external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which have since included human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as those used by the AQMI organisation.
Since then, the international community with Washington has been exerting pressure on Nigeria to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities had long considered the group of enlightened mystics to be of little interest.
Quick Results
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near the mosque, schools and fundamentalist Mohamed Yusufa. Boko Haram, which in the Haousas language means " westward education is sin", agrees with the establishment of Islamic immigration in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has such rapid success.
The sect is political and requires strict adherence to Islamic law, while its supporters fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s supporters became extremely active and reported their attacks on the police station.
The government's reaction is as usual still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the section Mohammed Yusuf is arrested and killed in prison.
From then on, the group is radicalized and leaves its way north.
On Friday, 2010, the city of Jos will host an interview with 80 people, followed by the next in Abuja’s capital.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police during his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local authorities of the UN will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist island in Africa, which should take from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since been concerned by all security specialists.
Now that Al-Kayda's Islamic Maghreb has turned Mali and the game and Somalis from Al-Shabab's nest are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, speaking with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said France is in the state of readiness and is ready to "deliver all information".
World by candidate to president
In questions relating to China, Iran or Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are referred to as simplification and unknown.
Can America’s weakened crisis fix the world through simple or even simple ideas?
In the hearing of presidential candidates, the voters could think of it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others repeat voices and expert instructions on foreign policy, which are already traditionally strong against the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated reports about China, Iran, or Israel’s assistance affect one another.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race on behalf of the Republican's Grand Old Party, threatened China's call to the World Trade Organization and their accusations "because of manipulation with their currency", which is a naked issue in America that has been exposed to the migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
It's worse if it's got to contain the launch of a trade war in itself, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, little by little got caught up in the existence of an “express” emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last places in the polls, remains unsolicited.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military officers in Iran if the sanctions failed to stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'm bound to Iran," declared Fanfaro.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Obama of breaking his obligations against this partner.
Lieutenant Herman Cain, the second best candidate, shows a sudden lack of knowledge of documents.
He recently called for a sharp presence against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - obviously unknown facts that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to defeat Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and other candidate Michel Bachmanno.
All of them are far away from the Republican candidate John McCain, who was in 2008 hard-core in foreign policy.
Opposers of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and still won a student war.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the inevitable departure of "boys" from Iraq, his comments on Libya, and thus attach a poor note to him
But the attack is not easy.
The citizens consider President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Ládin, more positively.
Iraq has no confidence in military principles that lead to corruption.
And with arguments that economic America needs to be rebuilt so that it can be restored to its leading position, Obama's key to the right place.
Nord Stream, new entry point of Russian oil into Europe
The remote North Stream, connected directly to Eastern Europe in Russia, began to function after the Baltic Sea.
He has to add the gas equivalent to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian Plynare, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government, attended the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly below the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte, were surrounded by a wave of Russian-powered gas in the western European network.
This new pipeline will begin to spend every year in western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian flue for the first time on the 1,224 km of the associated Petrohrad region with the Mecklemburg-Pomorian country.
The second attempt, to be completed by the end of 2012, is possible to provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the total French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of putting a third try on the same track.
For Gazprom, the temporary completion of this large building is the nature of the victory.
The project was strongly protested by Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, Nord Stream will be able to supply electricity directly to Germany without being carried out abroad by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Once again these two countries lose some power: the possibility of pressure on Russia to close access to the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
It was the strongest expression of Warsaw when it failed to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Treaty" with a call for an alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say it's politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater security of its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But this is at the price of energy shortages in Europe, because the project has created markets between Eastern and Western Europe.
Just five years ago, Russia was able to pass on its vision of a direct link between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose logistics is approaching its end.
"This plywood is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new heat that connects us organically," said François Filon when he celebrated the opening of this pipeline and demonstrated the extent to which large plynary contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom who are present in a large number in Lubmin, the leading gas station.
The status of this pipeline is also a major technical factor.
The underground effort is from the eye of the concrete plate to be protected from seagoing vessels.
It is calculated at sea bottom in an average depth of 200 m.
At his construction, he had to avoid the mine field from the time of World War II.
"Because of their safety, they had to be almost a hundred removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to raise measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The self-propelled attempt is a long-acting warhead weighing as 242 Eiffelook, which has never been broken down in any of its lengths or in the maintenance stations.
One control area was to be built close to Sweden, but the leading project prevented it when Sweden was only a little willing to see the Russian state company moving around.
"In the event of an accident, we stop the flow of rain in less than 1 minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a lack of moisture contained in the fluorescent water, it shall be kept in the air.
But this case has been considered to be unlikely, since weights have been proposed so that unhappiness can occur once in 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the exhaust outlet shall be carried out by the submarine robot, while the inlet of the pipeline is controlled by the device which circles inside.
This device of a diameter of 1 m is inserted into the inner tube and is pressed with a gas.
For the purpose of the three-day journey, 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on any deformities of the load parts.
A deep fluid was designed to function for a period of fifteen years without the need for more self-restraint.
The flow cycle is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
In order to achieve this project, five companies joined forces.
The lead position remains in Gazprom, which holds 51% share.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted to the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The basement has a seat in Zoug City in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely good.
Gazprom subsequently purchased the company for five years of contract, which can be renewed, all its capacity to transport electricity.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, regardless of the amount of actual transportable gas," says Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction was ensured by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
Total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion in both cases.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure their costs will be returned because they take the risk of taking on themselves only the Gazprom.
Swimming out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with bourgeois forests.
Ventilation high 4.5 meters creates an output barrier to the gas.
The camera shall measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming rain before it is transported to the German fluorescents.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - signwriter
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded decades ago, wants to regain joy in writing again.
It brings a wave of tolerance, an hour of burning songs at the light of candles.
The writer of Moleskine is easily distinguished by his black handboards and his letters spread white colors as when he was an adult.
However, as we know today, the writer of Moleskin was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo living in Milan will then decide to place a new design but distinguished writer on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, a consultant working for the company, is interested in introducing a new product.
The writer is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (mitration of the skin), which is used for example to fix the surface of the bottle.
This type of writer was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to the old and forgotten object, which was the icon of avantgarde artists until the 20th century," reports Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading figure in the fashion fashion company.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to reach 12.7 million customers last year.
The situation is remote from the first years when only 3,000 writers were created.
Moleskine crossed the Italian border and exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set up an art portrait of the purchaser, because the writer will take business as much as a student or a professional.
The image of the writer of Moleskine appears to be that its owners are humans of the cosmopolitan, culture and open spirit.
A small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has a staff of almost 100 today and has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York since 2008.
He sent his writers to the library and through the FNAC trade network to small shops in the middle of the city where he was able to pass his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the burning development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is implementing the development of the writer Moleskine: recently the sign opened the exhibition "Fashion", where architects or artists present their writer.
In August, at the time of the film festival in Locarn, she also introduced a new desk to the writer mentioning the Leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, jars, views on notes ... The label is extended to a wide range of containers.
The success of the project was: in the autumn of 2006 the company Modo was purchased by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is so high a share of unemployed handicraft workers?
Nearly 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today it will open 15 weeks for the employment of handicrafts.
Over the voluntary public policy that was introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is twice as high as average, i.e. 19% around 9% for the whole population.
Is that a call?
"No, he supports Éric Blanchet, the Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the Week of Employment for Handicrafts."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"In those days there was no percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"However, there's still much more to do."
It should be said that for unemployed persons, there are a number of obstacles to their access to work.
One is older: 37% is over 50 years old (17% average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a maturity and only 10,000 out of 2.3 million high school students are disabled.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in handicrafted sales 38% on average.
In the short term, these are the criteria that are particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent "the core of the problem", according to Christiana Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, who was established in 1992 to help businesses accept handicrafted workers.
That's how it's about objective speed.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that certainly develop, but too slowly.
A study conducted in the deeper IMS-Entrepreneure pour la Cité found that the manager's questions have a low level of knowledge about the person concerned" with a "representation of persons on a driving and mental or mental disability".
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far away from reaching the goal of employment of 6% of the workers under the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 represent 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of the Agefiph organisation entrusted with the selection of payments from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is that the number of "refunded" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 provinces to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real understanding, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of employees from 20 to 49 employees are employed by 82% of employees with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden the joy that this friendly run would bring them.
We're not going so far to write that there's a division between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to him at the court of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard soon calmed down.
Five months after the anger of his attacker in the battle against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave his players only words of praise.
"I am with Eden and his progress very calm, and the fact is that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," swears the player of the French Lille.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in the club games and the national men's, "it's one and the other, it's just right."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, who was attacked by Romania on Thursday night because of this conspiracy against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "fashion".
You can't even remember the word "joy."
Play against Bleus, who has been boosted for 7 years and in their winners in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This will necessarily contribute more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More, because against 'Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),' he recalls.
"We crossed right away."
"The power to play against them, it's just fun!"
Well done, Leekens mentioned the "horgost."
"Hrdost" to fight the party - Christmas."
"Hrdost" is also found in the quality of the souses", that France has become a very high-level team over a year after the trauma in South Africa city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc made a huge cut of work," he woke up.
Perhaps Belgium will miss Europe's next mystery, a technical footballist would like to see you in 2014 at the airport with the French route... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians are becoming big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy."
"Recognise this for next match." including against France.
Portugal is very aware of
The Portuguese poet Paulo Bento has a great optimism against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way to the two teams, he lacked realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes we will be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it. The Portuguese football representation in which its cormida has been in 2010 is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal's happily working in the course of 90 minutes.
There's one game to play and one match to Bosnia.
In the knowledge of the flagship outcome (0-0), it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal must have been more than an hour of movement, but it was not able to give him such a rare head that would take him away.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk, because we didn't throw our balls out."
But at the home of their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, Portugal is convinced that they are before the public, who should create a hot ball, even though the game is definitely as "very balanced", says the optimisticist, but the guns that consider Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a plan," said a 20-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance to be at the Euro 2012," said Carlos Quiroze.
An inconsistencies in Bosnia encourage Portugal to win and win.
An undecided game can be enough for the Bosnians who also need to make a head.
"It's a good result that nevertheless contains the risk because we didn't throw our balls out," Bento laments.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in the Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think about it."
Good idea, under the condition that this time can be realistic.
