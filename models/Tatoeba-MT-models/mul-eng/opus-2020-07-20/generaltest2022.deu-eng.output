The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the product value....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Masters and so there's no problem for me.
Just need a number or an indication that I should wear the package so that it can be drawn from you as a return.
A few days ago I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249 €.
Today it costs 179€.
That's what I'm really saying.
Do I need to cancel the order and order new orders for the best price, or do I have another possibility of writing?
I also generally think that children should not be forced to assume a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I find that it is also good to take care of the little ones.
Look a little short, help a little, bring the bottles, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help the family with and are involved.
As long as she can be a child enough, I can see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can decide for yourself whether this is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's going to turn K2 off and be with him for hours at the time.
Pure justice is probably questionable.
Perhaps, therefore, the statement of psychologists is also true.
Because if something really happened, such as fire, explosion, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to care for K2.
Whether this is now a risk you want to enter is of course your maturity;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Krimi / Thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the whole thing, but I don't want to miss the title anymore maybe someone might know here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal hunter commits suicide by oversucking himself with food and going to his roaches in secret.
The case will be taken by a Commissioner who, after a short check on his therapists, is responsible for the treatment of a clinic in which he is being treated with fear of patients.
The Commissioner has a little nothing that also has a fear (for fire) and lands on these therapists.
It comes to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide will go to the place of suicide and document and place the photos on the Internet.
Finally, it appears that this therapy is a type of underlying therapy group where the patients have a chip planted in the brain, the patient is under stress in the brain, and ultimately the patients are afraid of the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window with the intention of dying)
This fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end there is a great showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's how serious I'm sure the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to anyone, or if someone even told me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, you know, I don't have the password for Wlan.
You have to contact my husband first.
But that can last.
What steps must I take then?
Is it possible to get back the price difference ?
Child, 4 j., split under the dam needle
A child, four years old, has over the entire length of wood sprite under the dome needle (outside).
I've tried to take him with a penis.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't fall asleep and weh did.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Tomorrow it's going to the doctor.

LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and audio module on a lead disc we can achieve measurements of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be built in almost every corner of the track ranges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always comes with an 11x15mm large "sucker" speaker, besides a chalk-capsal construction.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 stages are as distinct as 2- and 4-set addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComplus®, the decoder is fully involved in a suitable digital central.
It manages all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read with appropriate centres.
For centers that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® applications benefit from up to 28 stages of journey at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the resolution of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the respected Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx® compatible centers.
The LockSound 5 decoder recognises the Marklin® brakes as well as the ZIMO® HLU brake command or the Lenz® ABC system.
Also the brakes with DCC brakes or with equal voltage are possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® Bremsdiode.
An ABC pendulum automatically enables the automatic pendant between two railway ports.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue equal and exchange drums.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to prevent updates
The new Omicron cases always provide policy and science in Britain.
By the end of the year, all qualified adults in England should therefore receive an award.
London - British Premier Boris Johnson wants to be faster than ever in view of the Corona update symptoms in view of the rapid increase in Omicron numbers.
Each adult in England will be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a previous recorded video message to his people.
Until now, the target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will also provide support to speed up the campaign in the countries of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, an emergency arises, so the protection of the vaccine needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased at a third dose.
"Let your boosters now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 further cases of Omicron were recorded in Britain, with the total number rising to 3137.
Compared to the previous, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I'm the one who's all represented by pronome.
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I'd like to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat complicated name.
I kissed him and every time he/she has a cultural background here, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep any officers on my feet.

There's a total of 5 books out there.

How can a polyester damage occur after 9 months?
Just try the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's already been working.
14 days no longer.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are again available and I want you to add 2 columns to the order and take it into account.

Content-warning: I'll write here something detailed about domestic violence.
I just need to write something from the soul.
I (21) come from professional reasons more often with the victims (and aunts) of domestic violence in contact.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately is too often that many victims don't help themselves or think we couldn't help them.
I'm pretty sure we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than I can do in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the double eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, I can't reach all of the people far beyond sight and hearing.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of cancer, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly very close to the trains, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But that will never make it easier.
Please, always think you're worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series lead to "League of Legends"?

Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was released.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the roses in Crailheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburgs Trainer John Patrick, looking back at the Pokal-Niederlage in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We've got something else in the bag."
That didn't take place after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) new location in the basketball Bundesliga.
Where more than the nuisance of the result, the nature and manner of the event were confused.
In addition, it was called a statistics that expressed the entire dilemma: The three-quote ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in words and writing 31 attempts - or questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough on the win at Teneriffa, and did not apply what we have trained."
That's the ball to move.
On the other hand, his reaction to Sebastian Gleim was: "A nice game to win the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It's felt like 10,000 people.
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their cost.
Not yet, because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, the 22 points marked and linked the game of his men.
"The best player I've ever trained," said Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, the performance forces such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) prevented the roses from reaching a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came at twelve points.
A lot of time for the hair doesn't remain happy.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the Russians received Skyliners Frankfurt, and then in Ludwigsburg maximum 750 visitors.
We had another email address before, but I've changed it.
Yeah, I've already reported to you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all insurance claims were rejected.
We have been informed again and they have been registered again.
We've already been reported to us a year and a half ago.
Stats like from the egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He was able to persuade his audience with renewed interpretations of shooters from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he can do it.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday this Sunday at the stage in Leipzig.
But that's not going to happen.
The planned concert was delivered in May 2022 - "on official instructions", to reduce the Corona virus.
Other events planned at the time of the adventure must also be seen first, as it is on the website of the singer, which will be 59 today, and its musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
Since January, the artists want to keep their deadlines due to the pandemic by 2020.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already been a young man and has enjoyed singing.
In Berlin he studied Operangesang, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchester together with Commilitones.
Since then, the Baritone has established himself with his repertoire of strikers and opportunities in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached exactly as his success album "For Women is no problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the nose in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair back tight and weighs on labels, Max Raabe is no longer thinking of the current German-language music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour. dpa since 2020.

Federal Minister Clara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by accession
The new Bundesbaum Minister Clara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the removal of large housing companies, as has been requested in Berlin in a referendum decision.
"There is no single new apartment with an arrangement, it changes only the property structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rents remain payable in the coming years.
A low mix of private tenants, companies or housing companies, for example, is the best protection against monopolisation.
In Berlin, the Coalition of the SPD, Green and Left Party is seeking to establish an expert committee to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
If the situation does not work out, Geywitz did not just talk to the FDP in the Apple Coalition about further distortions in rent law.
The Coalition Agreement provides for a rent price threshold until 2029, a reduction of rent increases in advanced housing markets and the expansion of rent.
I'll talk to the Minister of Justice to put this into effect as quickly as possible.
However, if the rent market does not slow down, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 deaths by Tornados in Kentucky
Many tornados have been taken by the United States in a worsening storm system.
Only in Kentucky could there be more than 100 people to blame.
The images from there remind us of a war area.
On Saturday night in the United States, several Tornados were subjected to severe arrests and possibly up to a hundred deaths.
The streams leave about 320 kilometres long snow of the desert, especially in the Glyed state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was crossed, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He's alone in Kentucky, with up to a hundred dead people, the official figures are rising hourly.

Companies pay mortgage premiums and change advertising reviews
While the Federal Government continued to reject the proposals for an investment premium, companies in Austria themselves took the initiative and offered their employees the money premiums.
In this way they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for imputation.
Also, the redesign of advertising logos to appeal - according to the German model - will increase the availability of Corona impedings.
He's been transferred to a company about what he's been told.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the grey!
I just led a group of 4 friends to the adventure over the Griffenpass and wanted to lead my heroes without delay into a campaign written for the players themselves.
We're playing DSA 5.
The great tower is made to write the evil weights and their motives, reflect the individual acts, and now I am writing the entry tax rate and already proud of my own feet on the first counter.
The Premises is that the heroes are supposed to bring a work with Greed of Gratenfelds into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
That is where further action is to be developed.
Some miles away from the village are to hire a group of Goblins and lock them in a shelter.
I want to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation on various kinds: beliefs, trades, threats, early recognition of the danger, which also affects players.
Group strengths: 8 common goblins, 2 with sprays, 6 with hooks and drums
At no note, the Goblins lift up the heroes in a hohway and flange to every three left and right to me the bows are armed, while two with wings stop the drilling.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are in, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and associated with the son of the village’s uncle, a half, found and healed.
Of course the carriage is gone.
2. If a download should be unstoppable even this half with two of his servants and the hero will come to the battle for help.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How does your God hold ex Machine of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to get into the adventure?
The Goblins Group will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: where, I didn't count on so many answers, especially not with so many excellent suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp again.
And put it together again.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work yet.

I'm born by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality of the German Sky has been increasingly taken away, so I want to make some air with this post.
For the first time, the transfer was cancelled in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 reporting to begin immediately.
Although the delayed start and start-up of the schedule was far behind the planning, it was still possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) and the majority decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has to take precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE had no choice here.
Despite the stupidity, Sky UK has already transferred the race.
Nevertheless, a small lobby: the commentor Olivier Blackies has accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then again there was regular knowledge in the F1 with the commentators Sascha Rous and Ralf Schumacher, so they both did not know that under a red flag they could change the tyres.
Although this situation had already taken place in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that obstacles can change the tyres if there were relevant functional conditions on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was a possibility to prevent this.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 in a pay TV transmitter.
Nor is it the first wheel wheel rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainty about rules.
General does not like the popular comment style of Rouss, but give it that taste is the case.
But I really like Heiko Water better than RTL.
To this end, persistent aberrations that make both of them simply unprofessional, such as the order of coffee at the (so unspoiled) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Recently, a lot of disturbances in the comment that he obviously does not take this seriously.
The latest is not just taking the advertising at Sky, in the running round, Sky is the only sender who goes into the advertising, as you can listen to F1TV, then only the German tonspur will have to come out without comment after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
They also make these two senders in training less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV sender.
Although you have to praise Glock and tree gardeners for their work, that alone does not allow me to look at the nights.
The other Sky Sport F1 program is also very appropriate and full of repetitions.
Totally Sky is really the worst German-speaking sender who transmits the F1.
Unionically, RTL is making a better job for the four racers that they can still transfer.
In any case, the large F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable sender.
I'd be interested in your opinion once.
On this page: #PRS_ORG#-Pennel light, measuring and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that will not yet be delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice, and I haven't seen anything before.
The first lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already identified a defect (the substance has a hole in the front part of the table) after relatively short time.
I beg your support.
Air pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium in addition to oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over airtheber.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate all the facilities.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps are suitable for 2 or more exits, so that you can connect more outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, each according to the model air pump, also offers to place an accent in the Aquarium, e.g. with an air condition (see us in the shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, muscle or similar.
The MK series has a special, scalded construction and thus provides for low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The air pump will be connected through an air flow 4/6 mm to an austromor....and it can already be released.
The air pump should be equal, or higher than the water pump and be carried out.
If the air pump is deeper than the water condition, you should set a ventilator between it.
Simply cut the air bubble and put the valve between it.
This would stop if the water ran back and forth, which runs the water from the basin through the pump...
If the air pumps are delivered in the open, you should also be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify in ebay the processing time with 3 days, the packages will be packaged daily and the packages will also be removed daily.
Run along the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to say a little bit, so no one's agreed, just because it's been a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding of all the employees who are also working in the shipping industry... of course there's no Corona keeping.
Please don't judge equally, just because the delivery is delayed, which is solely on package services.
Of course you like these services, even if we say at the moment, they've been fucking hard.
This is also a very different region.
Don't be bad to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are even better times.
How long will it take to order the gels with and without arms?
Can you also order your legs in light here?
Amazon Founder Bezo Send Astronaut's daughter and moderator to the World
The daughter of the first US American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip into the world.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, the freshly cut astronauts were taken into custody.
"Come back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue robe, as he opened the Luke to the chapel.
Under the appeal of friends, family members and workers from Blue Origin, the six passengers went and went out and crossed the Amazon ground.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds on their way and reached a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronauts to All Fleeted Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan was the owner of the company who paid for their tickets by four other passengers: space passenger Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
No matter how much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share it.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled after the short flight to her father's mission.
He worked hard at his jobs and had to do everything for himself.
She was just flying with her, said 74-year-olds with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would go back to everything he loved the most, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flys up to 100 kilometres high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is widely automated.
During the flight of the rocket-dried capsule, it reached a height of about 100 kilometers across the earth, at a time with severity, before the re-useable object was re-examined by large random screens.
The International Air Connection and many other experts see the earth as a border to the world, but there is no binding international arrangement.
It was already the third most popular all-out of Blue Origin: At the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Netherlands.
On the second of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was world famous for his role as "Captain Church" in "Star Trek", in addition to former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and former director of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to advance business with global tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to the climate.

Someone who worked in the biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I study at the first semester of biochemistry and find the job really very exciting and also in the lab does not interfere with me (has already been the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have already been informed before the study on career prospects, but at the same time, I was still thinking about what I would like to study until the promotion.
But at the moment, I have doubts, especially the ambitions of the profession.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you will always hear excellent job opportunities and the job has been completely searched, on the other hand you will always hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really care:
1) What do you do at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/keeping?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain and I'm going to cancel the study, possibly 2022, and make training for the computer.
If you have experiences there write the same time :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays
This issue came to my attention last week.
But now I had to use my long weeks to relax.
That's why it's just a pofoste.
Not just before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there are great stress in our business.
It seems that there are also those before holidays plus birthdays.
It was like this: Last week Maria Heavenwayt was called in Switzerland "Afford" with us.
On Friday, the majority of people and companies make a birthday that is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Over stress.
Louter e-mails, which is not required before departure, order here order there, all *unconditioned* before the long week.
Because... and because?
Because "the next week then" sounds so long and that can't be?
Or is it because people want to spend as much as they want in a busy week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed at midnight, but I was excited.
What should this self-reliance be for holidays?
What else do we have when we can't send them to us properly?!
The stress didn't notice from above, the colleagues were all so self-defense.
My question is simple: are we just the Swiss?
Is that our reformed evangelical type?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld enjoys Christmas in Thuringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) rejoices at Christmas in her Tyrian home - but there are no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, is simply going to Ilmenau in the Thuringer Forest," said the actor and singer Hit Radio FPH.
She will vote on the party by backing up and bastling her son with her son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the next few days, however, they have something else to do: "For the first time, I have no gifts, I have to quit now."
NEKTON-Bio supports an endless run of the mouse and food education.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, mineral substances, sporene elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio provides the bird with a smooth and bright meal.
The majority of the food damages in poultry holding shall be attributed exclusively to nutrition errors.
Since the feed consists of an ever-lasting substance, a particularly rich and balanced feeding of the bird is a requirement for the formation of an untapped feed.
For a functional change, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are due to lack of or uneven egg imports and/or insufficient supply with vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the adverse relationship of amino acids is clearly taken into account and balanced in most plant feed products.
No other vitamin preparation should be taken during use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water-free and can easily be taken over the drinking water or the soft food.
Thank you so much. I found it.
Unfortunately not yet working
DDR manual model Altbau E-Lock E 95 03 DRG/DR, the lock was in Schlesien and Central Germany in use, which is probably from the construction proposal of the ME Modelile Trainer Heft 11/1968, used with toys and missing parts see photos, function, The Baureihe E 95 is a hard-drawn electrolomotive of the German Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the treatment of heavy carbon supplements in the Schlesch network, where the construction also comes from the small-scale company ZSCHUTCHKE and BACHMANN.
A Lokomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
The Deutsche Reichsbahn company had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electrolytic motif that could transport 2,200 tonnes of coal and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' Lokomotive with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens shocks with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six Lokomotives received operating numbers E 95 01-06.
They all crossed the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
The Lokomotives arrived in 1946 as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausungungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment of all six Lolomotives was established.
[4] When the increasing re-electrification of the medium-German network provided a growing demand for Lokomotives for heavy freight service, the three Lokomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, where the other machines served as replacement distributors.
Firstly, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger numbers were built.
Only when the E 94 was considered that the number of jobs could not be increased could the E 95 refer to the point of employment.
[4] Mostly, the Lokomotives were stationed in Leipzig-Wahren railway works.
They arrived in 1960 at Halle P.
They were used in their own transformation plan mainly before cooling from the gel count towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problemally, with increasing age, the complex control of the Lokomotics is demonstrated.
Thus, it was suggested that protection should remain in operation.
Then the constant beimann with hammer and wood keel on this locomotive had to re-solve the protection during the journey.
The damage to the motor vehicles occurred several times and led to monthly accidents at the Lokomotive.
[5] Since the late 1960s had sufficient neo-baulous comotives and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could be banned from the old Lokomotives and most splittings, so that the E 95 were provided out of service.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn wanted to own electrolytics only individually, which would have resulted in a problem with the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the views of the driver.
[5] After the removal of E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid 1969, the E 95 01, which ceased the service on 5 October 1970, followed them.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore not used.
Until the E 95 02, all Lokomotives were performed.
The E 95 02 was replaced by the future museum slomotive E 77 10 as the wine heise plant at the main railway hall.
It took some time before the officials at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was valuable as a museum slomotive.
In 1979, the first external construction of the Lokomotive started with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle view in RAW dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the transport museum Dresden as a non-operable museum slomotive.
In 1986 the inner completion of the Lokomotive was completed.
At the DB Museum Hall (Sale), the Lokomotive Museum is maintained.
Since 1995, members of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the construction of the Lokomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive was first presented to an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external locking, where the transformers were tested and five drivers were able to operate.
- The Lokomotives were on the Schlesische Mountainsbank and the two adjacent areas in use until 1945, where they were guaranteed on the basis of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were hidden after Leipzig to the middle German network.
The main area of employment was first Schlesien
Handwork Model H0 in OVP, function good, it's an optical follow-up work on the lock in own-work, installed, with game trails, keller smell!!!, very rare handwork model, very small installation - where possible the construction is also from the small-scale company ZSCHUTCHKE and BACHMANN
The packs may contain labels and storage trails.
Yes, the F parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were some problems.
The middle bar will be held by two feet..lender these are too narrow and the panel cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, which are unfortunately misproduced.
The media bar does not fit in the intended maintenance.
So I'll be able to send you a new one.
When will they be released?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
These are, according to the assembly manual the right form, they were just too narrow
But that's not true.
Mainly, they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Can I get this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Housing fire with two light damages and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the sixth euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire must have spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were brought to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoking.
At first, the exact reason for the fire was not known, but the police did not depart from an additional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further findings.
But it's going to come in a lot later.
And I have to pay the shipping costs again.
To get rid of fake news - Biontech-CEO published Impf Photo
Ujur Şahin published a photo of his first impunging early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech-Chief Uühr Şahin had not been publicly present at his impasse.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona impact.
The illness of a friend moved him to tell Şahin.
The CEO and founder of the main company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, have published a photo showing how he receives an imputation against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false information that I was apparently not affected.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the biotech pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in an entry in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, my friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I will be impressed to resist these false rumors."
Until then, he rejected it because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply moved when I learned that an old schoolmate now fought me for his life.
He's been fighting a severe covid 19 cancer, and he's been on a battle machine for three weeks.
The schoolmate and his family were not impressed, Şahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often caused by misinformation and misinformation."
Fear only makes it hard to fight facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Welle, who says Uühr Şahin, has not been affected.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle made it clear.
"I'm not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
In Germany, a priority has been given to the completion of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the priority has been raised for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been able to accept appropriate data three times.
Fire in space: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light was released on Friday: no electricity anymore and in many cases there was no heating.
A fire had released a resuspension station.
After a fire with severe damage in a resuspension station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Creis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to get out for about 24 hours without electricity.
The fire caused light to rise in several communities by 41,000 residents and residents affected by the fire.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency units were operating until the major disturbance could be completely required at the end of the late evening.
Firefighters and assistants and assistants of the THW provide support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care in schools and called for assistance to the neighborhood.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We are also grateful to the municipalities concerned, the circle, the firewalls and the THW for the uninterrupted use," said Prime Minister Florian Witt in a statement on Saturday.
The repair of the damage will remain in force for a few days, as the Westnet Montours were able to take some instructions only temporarily back into operation at first, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire by companies.
Reflowing stream
The fires fired on Friday at 19.15 a.m. in the Neunkirchen-Seascheid Responsibilities Station have subsequently severely damaged the data of Westnetz.
There are outstanding cleaning and repair work needed.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this Bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 18 o'clock, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppechiroth have had electricity again.
Other 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been activated progressively from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last power affected by the accident would have been the same.
Over 80 Monteurs of Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
After the construction of a emergency building, the authorities also called for emergency assistance on Saturday's afternoon.
"It is now important for citizens and citizens to care for older or independent people in their neighborhood and to share in local fire-fighting houses when help is needed," Landrat Sebastian Schister (CDU) said after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of Notströmaggüggets, especially the residents of old homes were in focus.
In addition, temporary care facilities were established in schools for those who were unable to provide themselves or who were required to provide medical care in relation to medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the deck has been sold in Germany.
Can I buy those with you and pay for it in Euro?
It's about the day deck #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and stay healthy ¢
But I can't mount the show on the table.
It's about custom #NAME#.
There are 3 executions.
We wanted those with table plates through #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came to my attention, but I can't separate it and thus cut it short.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I had to send her back because she's not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be glad to get back.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it!
Send me the receipt by mail?
the repair is now over.
I've already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I didn't start the E-#PRS_ORG# again.
Should I do it now?
I think I'm pretty embarrassed to have such a low spelling.
So we don't understand.

To ensure that the paint job is equally clean and clean, you should clean the parts with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, fill them with clear water and extract them.
Before you first bring the pen with a new color on the model, it is recommended to apply 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the building or on a jewellery.
The first string of the string to be printed
Draw the pen equal to the string next to the string.
Light overlap of the colour layers later ensures a level playing field.
Avoid quickly and wash with the brush.
This creates unrealistic real areas.
A model is not a garden house.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark may look later.
Metaltones and metallic colors come to a close with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come into bad metals when they mix with normal colors.
Let the damaged parts dry for a day before you build them.
Original shapes reach the models through the Decals or abstract images.
From high speed signs on aircraft over ship names to rail and signs on auto models: Decals give the model the last switch.
Bring the decals into the correct sequence as long as the components are still well reached.
An aircraft cockpit can be loaded more easily before it is built into the pump.
Even more important than the right tool, such as sword, penzette and tooth dryer, are at the time covered, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out any needed decal individually and let it fit you.
Decals are also called watership images, because you are slowly straightening their back with water until the transporter paper gets dark through the nose.
Then you turn the image into a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also washed before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, you remove the accompanying paper.
Attention: Always check whether the image is right before you completely remove it from the paper, so that it does not stick, cut or even grow on the finger.

Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book for a while, as soon as I look at something else, then I don't read the book anymore and have to log in and log in and reload the book again and search for the location I have read.
I've been communicating with you since Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lights came in 3 individual packages with me.
Thank you very much.
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money comes back.
But will I get it back without trouble?
Child care at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were some time in child labour treatment, now that it's about accounting with the PKV, this suddenly becomes queer.
Queued for:
We had applied for child labor in advance at the PKV and made 3 attempts.
The tests were not limited in any way (e.g. temporary frameworks, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and led 2 (follow-up) trials, but they didn't work out with the PKV yet.
Once again, we applied for cost recovery at the PKV and received 3 further attempts.
After some further trials (we have carried out more tests than said, logically calculate the most expensive with the PKV) we get the calculations at the PKV and get the worst surprise: instead of 5 tests (2+3), the PKV will only replace 3 tests.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the other 2 tests of the first sentence occur.
The second child soldier was a new insurance case.
However, according to the UK, "The insurance case begins with treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round are here:
* Who has the right here to replace the PKV (only 3 attempts will be replaced) or we (are 5 attempts to replace)?
* Did the PKV have to show us in the promises that the further trials would occur with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed eggs) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts were to give your opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
You can let me get the three options by email and tell me how I reach them again
All right.
We're not going to order anything with them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They may be pleased to send this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was paid and now you tell me I have to send it back.
I can't really do anything to completely destroy the commode when I arrive
Please see in the screenshot what the college wrote
There is clear and clear that the refund has been paid and I have not yet received a refund per #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have lost two tribal clients now.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office needs to maintain normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office office.
Regardless of this, the 24-month insurance is valid.
No, I can't create another kind of packaging.
I'll build the boat and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional Hockers, but we cannot find them with you.
Can I help you?
Week Theme: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is right, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the network you can find enough lists of low-budget films like zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know your interesting representative of this category?
What's wrong with you guys?
And what do you probably not like?
In a very good customer of you, 2 apartments have been fully equipped with your furniture.

Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll get up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" to political expert Raphael Bossong in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong said to the Evangelical Press Service (e.g.
The EU has not consistently resolved the confrontation, explained the researchers of the Berlin Foundation Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of affairs - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - it may still be a long way to go.
The deal with people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It is obvious that "increasing normalization of Pushbacks" is being done by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decide against it, this goes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development is weak at the same time as the Union's cohesion.
"It can't obviously pass on if a Member State sets itself up to do its thing," as in Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong said: a basic statement on asylum policy will be rejected as the line "border protection, border protection and border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewal of cross-border attempts
According to Poland's border guard, therefore, once again migrants have tried to reach Belarus in Poland.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday, and returned to the border, a speaker from the authorities said on Sunday.
The Polish officers had been attacked near the site of Czeremza by the migrants with stones.
As a result, a soldier was found in the face and had to be provided medically by a military officer.
In total, the border guard 52 tried border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU invites Alexander Lukaschenko to join the EU with a view to joining the EU.
In Poland and Lithuania, regular press reports are subject to border sections.
The EU has Sanctified Belarus and sad airlines, bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travel to people's countries of origin to join Aborigines there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the planes, Bossong said.
"The EU has thus lost its market power in the Waigschals and has demonstrated its determination to operate with severe flagships and extra-territorial sanctions."
Mensk must also take into account internal costs.
The Belarusian society may not have been established to ensure that the security equipment is regularly locked by thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protested after conflicting formula-1-finals
Max Steps are expected to have two regular breaks during the race in the view of Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula-1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed a complaint.
The silver fines are equal to two lines of rule in the last big price of the year.
A protest relates to a relatively misunderstanding of Max Steps in Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he should have been regularly overrun.
A second claim was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed by regular compliance.
In the last round, Lewis Hamilton was still overrun in Mercedes and was entitled to his first formula-1 title.
The mannover succeeded shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Netherlands had overrun driving cars before him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report again to you.
Thank you for the support.

I'm sorry, but only because he says he's not antisemitic doesn't mean anything.
It's like a traitor says he has nothing to do with foreigners.
Your i won't be given both.
But college always reproduces some antisemitic messages.
If you want to stay away, you should just let it go.
Yeah, well, where are you going to be less serious like a colleague?
Those who seriously question the basic issue of Evolution are simply completely lost.
I mean, one God has brought all of this into existence.
But as soon as you're creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is nothing but ours.
And that's why you're a science enemy and don't take any more seriously like college.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be measured as closely as possible.
The specially aplanatic-acromatically designed lens system allows you to make practical use of the lupe to the range.
Often, lupens are marked with magnification masks.
However, these data only apply to precise conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the best use of your lupe, we invite you to take note of the references in the table "Technical Data" (see package leaflet).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, so also at the entrances, light-flexe is created.
These savings are significantly reduced by an anti-reflector.
In keeping with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirroring on the lens surfaces are less realistic.
Further information is available in the relevant user instruction (in German and English).

Dental sale in beautiful forest: In the village of Krembz women search for Christmas trees
Agricultural Frank Diers has already experienced such a sad situation in the dental sale.
Once, a man should even be taken home without his partner, because both of them were unable to join each other.
Every year he plants 2,000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-olds have already experienced such a sad situation.
That makes the premise night always fun, he says.
And that with the good look?
I'm not a customer?
However, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to conduct discussions here on the best court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat, that is to be burned at a three-six-footed spade.
And they both have their names.
In Germany, a equivalent may be as much as the "dreher" which in general does not sound so nice.
Problems with glazing + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass phase connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
I used to have a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and exported 50 Mbit free of charge up to a few cases.
The new glass phase connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, not the full 500, but I continue to remove myself from the house with the module, which is less (so use a single dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. space is removed from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new glass phase connection is even slower now than before (\~45 MB).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here too.
Could anyone explain to me why the Internet's "lost" power drive is so fast with glazing?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely exciting to place in the LAN cable house.
I'm really wondering why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased with an answer.
When the time is right to change the giro account
Anyone who had thought, now that it was the first time peace was at the Girocounts, looks tired.
While many banks have used the brain to confirm, with all their tricks from their customers, the tax increases in the past will also continue to fall free for negative interests.
The German bank, for example, was considered relatively large with a limit of EUR 100,000.
Now she has doubled the amount of freedom once and even paid for the daily wage.
In the first step, the threshold was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros in Giro and plant accounts and to 25 000 euros for daily accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire German bank, as confirmed by a speaker at the request.
And although not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with file customers".
The Commercial Bank has already been at a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB has reduced the amount of allowances to two levels, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25 000 euros.
However, more than 100 banks have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less, according to figures from the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached EUR 25,000: However, there is still a legal representation with the consumer centres, which have received the right to this arrangement in the first instance before the Berlin Court of Justice.
It is now discussed in the banks whether institutions should be able to draw up feedback - in the case that the higher authorities must also explain the negative factors in principle and pay back many millions to banks.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's now officially at the Hollywoods Spice.
But your life is like a mountain of mountains and valleys.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen from the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" to the most influential woman of the year.
For her who made 2021 with the "friends" reunification and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of many disciplines and work.
To make her appearance, a whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches is concerned.
Anyway, like Aniston, they could read a chip on the day (yes, right: a one-in-one chip from the tobacco).
It is indeed a miracle that you reach the hearts of female and male fans.
Maybe because she's just stuck with happiness - and still looking for great love.
And the baby boy from the list has fallen.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was going to be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked about it have no idea what's happening to me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really damaging.
Always hope that success and peace will make you happy too.
Invalid end of a career: opportunities must end
Kimi Räikkonen's deviation from formula 1 was even less than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and increased the sweat from the stars.
That's it.
After a driver’s error and a slight band delivery, the rich had to give up his Alpha Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi not even the half of the rent.
It was his 349th and last big prize, the Iceman finished his career in the Motor Sport Royal Class.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children also moved to the United Arab Emirates.
The greatest success of the empire was the World Championship 2007 in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich holds 60. World Cupsieg - Nolte sees in the bierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Enar Björnalen with 94 success is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've calculated this time, I've had to go through the new season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic player from the BSC Oberberberenburg, who bought two success in the winterberg race in two days.
First, he refused the attack by Johannes Lochner on Saturday at five hundredths, in which he fled from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberberenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall), he sat in front of the British Brad Hall.
Thirdly, the Austrians became Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also imported his 22nd victory into series.
Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to the place two times this time at five.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Feilnbach landed to Rank four in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would do the same," said Lochner.
Christmas with home page - Podium for Jamanka
In the women, Laura Nolte took the third season at her home in the second round.
After only on Monday at the fourth place in Monobob, she met Deborah Levi on Sunday at the German triumphal procession with Archipelago.
Two-bomb Olympicser Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringen came to rank two with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic Qualification, she bought the first podest place in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in three places.
For me it was supercool, the first podest place in the worldcup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me in.
I'm very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," Burghardt said, "It's not just a shot, but there's a lot to do."
Jamanka complained a little about the not completely wrong driving, but he said, "It's going to the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I didn't get it, so I can't get rid of it.
I've had other problems with Corona last year, and I've never had time for it.
And now he's been running out of something that upsets me very much.
Look at the chat it went around the Asare Bank.
I want to give it back and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.
There was nothing from such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I'm on the tip comes an extra field with the message
I'll be taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you images from the wrong stuff.
But we want the regular module, even a new undamaged
And don't break the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have something I just want to write, and maybe it's the one - or the other...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time students and dogmama - since my dog doesn't scream or goes into the children's gardens, he's actually 1 to 1 to 1 to my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has had a burning 2nd grade on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we had a lot of fun and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in connection with wg burning).
He's upstairs refreshed and we're seeing less (1-2x week) what makes me very creative with my needs after reconciliation and love.
My dog's just got buchewh, I bought it for him and now he's in his kitchen jacket, and he's got a little rest after I was with the heat pump and screaming for him there.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and that's just a month away.
Now we still have homework to do, which we naturally share.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just quite well established, I am half well treated and come right.
It's not good, but I'm right, and I'm almost unsympathetic.
My Union just needs a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 a.m., I have done a written test for which I have done nothing yet, and overindulging anatomical hours for which I should prepare at least a few things.
And next week, I've got an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room anymore.
So my weeks go like this: Just until morning, then it's weekend.
But then it's all going on?
Just until the birthday.
Just until the holiday.
Just till weekend.
Just until...
And that's how it's going to last forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somewhere I feel guilty and "chatistic" but others don't make it...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I'm incredibly grateful that I don't have to work.
Thank you very much. I can't even say that.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think it also has some sort of mental load to do with women, and that's why I thought I'd find a safe family here...
I would like you one more refreshing evening at any time, the week is almost over!
I have today received my order unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and tablebed has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're gonna mix the table now, I'll get another color or what?
The e-mail for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I then found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that for her it is just another profession like Mathe or earthlyists.
It was always rare for me, perhaps also because I was raised as a Christian, and I have always believed in something like that.
Who do you think you are?
Maybe you can also tell your colleagues about different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is meaningful to distinguish.
There's a new school plan, too.
But it just turns out to be a physiotherapist who does not believe in the relativity theory.
What, then, makes one want to learn religion if you don't believe it?
A culture true or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't be changed or not? Writing please English I understand that too
It's been a long time, then I'd take a look at it.
It's good, thank you.
I'm expecting a return message by the end of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please find help for the movie
Hello, love people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two times (or parallel values).
To one of the moderns (real world).
To others the past (or the kingdom of death) (not necessarily).
As I can't describe it any more, there's a young woman in the real world.
And in the reign of the dead a young soldier (Uniform similar to those of the soldiers fleeing from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the roads cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the deaths of the woman who wants to bring into this kingdom to live myself.
The transition is I believe the soldiers' graveyards too.
At the end of the fight, I believe in each other.
If you say something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept only on the roof from week 1.
Fixed forward: alive :D
Relax.
That's how a child feels more than you think.
Be careful that everything is going around, no pets, once and for all, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you jealous!
Fresh air in the room.
Good Matatze.
No kisses.
Ahsso and we didn't have a bed bag, but we've always had a roof.
Watch your child sleep.
Is it going to the head?
Can it be made up of something?
Or is it in front of the matrix?
You can turn it off if everything's okay.
We're all grown too, and when my husband came to the world, it was zb going and showing that you put the kids on the wall to sleep.
Besides, we've already bought you "students" and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I've been writing to a colleague of you yesterday, and I haven't been back yet.
It's about my dress chain, which came earlier. (Postal number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right shoulder doesn't fit in the chest.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The knife is not to be used at this time.
To make it very clear.
RBTV has made a lot of promises.
And yes, I know myself, can't keep everything.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is only so simple that the policy of this sender is at the center of all Sau.
Almost every format is submitted (also), but then go to a large hotel tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet sender.
Zitat Arno: You want to "not be a running lithphasal".
What are you doing now?
An 0815 publisher trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitef.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Of course it applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people can continue to policy.
A crogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the spaces that have been exploited tries to make axles.
How are you gonna find that all right?
Great if you like it, I find it scary.
I'm asking you to go back because my wooden defect was made.
Body use by damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a toaster at buchweh or simply for the kitchen – My little warm friend is often usable.
Kirschkern kisses are a traditional home for well-being heat applications, as Kirschkerne heat can be taken very well and dosed again.
The extractable inner pockets can easily warm up in the microwave or in the back of the oven.
The soft reference makes the application especially pleasant so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not as good as they are.
The Kirschkern kitchen with respect is only suitable for the following applications:
Before heating the kitchen on untypical floor, floor or fireplaces, check and take immediate action when available.
Please take the inhaler out of the relationship first!
warm in the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (be aware of the manufacturer's information!)
Just after the erection, distribute the heat by shelves at the same time in the kitchen!
Then put the box back in the reference.
At first heating it can become a light humidity training, but it will disappear in repeated applications.
Do not rely on the specified heat signals, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (flamming and burning risk!).
Before heating the kitchen in the microwave, check that an erection of child products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated intestine has been returned to the reference, please check the temperature of the kite on the cap for babies (max. 43 °C) at your armpit!
Do not use the kit in acute and chronic, emotional or fiacious diseases, round-the-clock complaints, fresh haematomas, blood vessels and open veins, as well as in people with reduced pain.
If you have an existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor disease, or if you are pregnant, please contact a doctor.
If the needle has been opened and empty kernels are removed, take care of the product and the loose kernels immediately and unavailable for children.
If the product is used for babies under 1 year, the child’s temperature should be monitored regularly during application to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is placed.
The reference is soluble and at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Darmstadt 98 can dream from the return to the Football Bundeslagi.
This is why Hannover 96 works from the table cell.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third trainer either.

Is the battery locked?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my network.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the network was just enough to run.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts in spite of an embedded part of the network.
That's why I built the battery, but there's nothing going on here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is there anything else that's wrong?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG #stuhl.
But you don't know how high the seating area is...
How often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
There is no problem with the daily V2 backpack of Peak Design!
20 litres of fittings also turn larger photo devices off without problems that can be safely understood by the Polished FlexFold component.
And whatever else you need on everyday matters, it remains well organized and separate from the camera, thanks to practical access to the individual configuration area.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series is still presenting in a new look.
The smart, minimalistic design has been in speech - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that protect the inner area of the trunk and, nevertheless, provide fast access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally over the cover cap that can be closed with the MagLatch switch system, an excellently thought-in-depth solution for effective protection that has already been guaranteed by the messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a closed glass of metal in the front of the trunk.
Unlike most back pockets, Peak Design has considered different "full" conditions: there are 4 anchor bars, destroyed stables that can be entered into the locker.
If the bag is loaded full, you just take the top panel, it's empty, deeper.
Clothing and hacking are also magnetic.
That way, the back bag can also be closed confidently without touching the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo bags: In addition to the cover cap, there is still a cross opening on both sides of the back bag.
This eliminates most of the traditional back pockets with access from above - you don't have to choose the content anymore!
At the same time, this smarter detail increases the daily visibility of the bag: If you take not only your photo equipment but also daily items or travel packages.
On Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus understand both problems separately - and even regardless of the side openings.
In addition, you can remove the back bag from the right side of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right corner, while the daily conditions are safe in the left half of the back bag and not between.
A convenient, uncomplicated trajectory helps.
And since the outer sole of the back bag is also completely made of 100% recycled, windproof nylon, the content remains dry itself if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I was waiting for the email from her support.
yesterday I received an e-mail confirming the assignment of the
Contact reception is announced from the shipment to recover the misdelivered table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking you to take immediate action.
I am already writing with the third support staff member, and I have not been able to reach any agreement that I have received as a confirmation.
It's about the return of the wrong custom #NAME#
So it's to look out when the bottle could be delivered again?
It's not an option for me to keep him like this.
It works.
Thank you so much for the help.
Would you like another nice evening?
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was at 12.1.21.
I was given a completely different lamp when I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the look to me, I'll also give you a larger order, but still I kept the damaged furniture and did not send it back.
And that last year was different than thought, I couldn't know and I didn't have the right time to figure it out and clear it out.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept it that way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to assess the requirements of the dynamic driver, reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are produced from Guss and then mechanically processed (birth and cut).
All thin discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics that are own for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special repair programme will be developed, which will be adapted to the characteristics of the original mount.
The discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the discs, where the sections improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake locks.
Aesthetic properties of our crafts underpin it by attractive and striking appearances the character of each car.
Coloma is the city where the history of the West Coast was celebrated in an unexpected event.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered the south floor of the American River lighting bridges in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from Nah and far and became one of the rapidly growing and flowering cities of the country.
Areas were closed, cells were set up, and halls and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Colima or Bancrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You'll look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and surrounding areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues so that you don't get along with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, you need to save your resources and build a table that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The building on your table allows you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your needs.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge spaces, you can develop your individual game style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official citizenship).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will choose a location on the game plan where they can carry out their actions.
Then their selection will be covered and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a place has most pioneers, he gets a spring!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take different actions, such as the acquisition of resources, the movement of cars, the creation of cells, the search for streams, the construction of bridges, the opening of businesses and the positioning of revolutionaries.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the start of each round, the buyer turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on for as long as the buyer has moved five times, so each place has once covered and the year ends.
There's a shooter in which players must protect the Coloma from an overfalling bandits.
If the players have managed to control enough revolutions and the bandits have been paid in cash, they will receive rewards.
However, if they break up, they will receive less rewards or end up at the Peace Court.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score is reached.
The player won with most winning points!
For free shipping I take up to the size 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping, shipping (played).

"Why Children aren't Tiranese" Doku, ARD Media
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I have seen it at the same time.
>The Child Psychiatry Michael Winterhoff is a well-known guest in Talkshows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrant" (2008), he concluded a intensive education debate.
Former patients:in and eligible for treatment now raise serious objections against him.
Please be aware that the film is hard to wear.
And I am very grateful that many people think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsibilities must never, never, never! to have power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as big as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brr, I'm still being shot.
Holetchek: countries advise on the absence of the test obligation for three-fold impact
The Ministers of Health of the Countries will decide at their next meeting on a thorough departure from the test obligation for three-fold seizures.
"We urgently need clarity, whether or not for three purposes,” said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), president of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The case of 2G plus for three-fold seizures is "not only medically sensitive, but also provides an additional impefance," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that he will make a proposal on the next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back.

What can this be?
What you describe is referred to as *Awarensess*, so it's meant to be full-fledged.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, rarely to see images, and most rarely to experience pain.
For this issue relevant: Caissors cut operations are associated with an increased rate of Avarenes, as a very deep drug is avoided for the protection of the child until the abortion.
Previous episodes of avarenes should be mentioned in the drug prevention discussion.
Certain methods of anaesthesia such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes Awarenness correctly, however, had no definition** u/Nitemarex **.
Your comment was wrong.
But the chair is defective.
The 20€ are not helping us either.
These are legal claims for insurance.
The absolute minimum would, however, be that they would take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, it is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again whether they are taking back the defective chair at least.
We sell the second chair then private.
Then we'll lose some money too.
I already sent you a message that you didn't answer.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the account, the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The sender is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver them before the house - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can put the heavy furniture in the first floor.
I'm not gonna call?
I had a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle died 97 years old
He's been profiled as a theatre critic and an intent.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking Diary of a slow departure from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture, the news comes that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I've already touched my life."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European wood pallets, which are used primarily as loading engines in the European area.
They are certified by the EPAL European palette Association
In 2020, statistics of Austria were produced in Austria over ten million pieces of palettes.
The value of production was EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported annually to Austria will not be raised
New York holds MLS Mastership for the first time

Roladen Tips & Tricks
I've got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect bottle.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly expensive and buttergart!
So thank you again for :)
Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook for Silver for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a fund for it.
Do you have any more tips for me besides?
Note: I don't have an oven, but just a big top.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good, but I get it.
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. per mail that the refund was paid.
But until now, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check it out.
Where there are Christmas fries in the room
For many people, Gans or Ente belongs to Christmas days such as the dance tree and the gifts.
You haven't been worried about flying yet?
Now the time is fast.
We'll tell you where you get another Christmas friar in the room Lübeck.
The "drive" of a rolling stock contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar booster sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME regulator, you can set the desired angle on the one hand and on the other the volume of your sound.
In addition, the VT+ series enhancers offer a unique Power LEVEL ruler that can reduce the threshold without changing something on the "Gain" and the distortion.
Further above it is already heard that one can float a performance reserve with the power LEVEL regulator even if it happens to be unreasonably loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL-Regler, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an extremely "acoustic" sound pressure when you use a headphone or when you take it directly.
The AUX book can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so that you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
In addition, one who spends a VFS5 foot key can easily raise the sound by foot, turn off the effects blocks and the time of the corresponding compatible effects "stop".
For the living use, this is really inevitable.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step in the future!
But he had seen it in others like this.
So is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for a restaurant?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the Commode?
Do we get an update next week to the exact delivery deadline?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs.
If it isn't, I'd also be satisfied with a nursery or glove.
Under the circumstances, I find a receiver for the furniture.
Just over €1,000 for goods I don't need, then something much.
I had just received my delivery and I'd like to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I'd like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (Port) on the expected hacks.
This is no satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on atomic conventions
In the negotiations on the renewal of the International Atomic Agreement, progress is being made according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are just about to focus on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief contractor Ali Bagheri on the Sunday of the Irina News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development" because at first there was no consensus on the issues to be dealt with.
The agreement is to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the agreement were continued after almost one week's interruption.
The negotiations take place in Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringen overholt Sachsen - Freistaat now Germany with the highest Corona inzidenza
Thuringen has dissolved Sachsen and currently shows the highest incidence.
As the only Germany, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringen, the only country in Germany, has been located at the Corona incident on Sunday over the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute introduced the 7th day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxons, which had recently shown the highest incidence, this value was at 990,5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringen was low, but also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringen a day 2242 new seizures were reported with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection.
200 severe Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
On weekends it may be late for notification.
In addition, health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are soon to come to the conclusion of new cases.
I get it.
Since delivery takes place in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and put it on the package and give it to the post that was?
I don't have to click/say/fill anything else here?
That's exactly why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take the shipment back at my own expense.
8 euro refund is a duty in my eyes.
It is time for changes
I've been welcomed, I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a wonderful day!
#Where's the post?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBund day, you can determine one: it is not extensive.
We arrived in a winter star and extended the summer camp for a few months.
# What's the problem?
Yeah, why did it happen?
For the most part, it should simply be associated with dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we generally appear.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many here still have a look on the MBund day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBund day that they want to keep alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has been paying attention to this project in the last days and has found a screen hall.
After writing and writing, several people from the community have found the pleasure of rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call on all of you to participate, and that is the only way that this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a record server, on which we can exchange each other, as well as develop concrete things.
The server may have access to this link.
Destination:
* How should the MBund day work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we go out in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but it's not bad, so we've finally got the record.
If you have fun and time, it comes to the record, works with and lets us decide democratically about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen with you to be delivered yet.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another stop with you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft shoulder.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day deck #PRS_ORG#, is there the same thing in oversize, so for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG#, however, I must be able to guarantee that the wrong kind will soon be eliminated.
And I'm asking you to leave now.
a suitable packaging I don't have, but the bottle will be unmounted as far as possible for recovery - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to agree on a term of retirement.
Is there a guide to the assembly?
How long would I have time to take care of these or decide to return?
How do you answer the question, why are you here?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived a long vegetarian life, perhaps even very rarely meat.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned step forward, I have responded honestly without much thinking.
And although I had long thought that as a vegetarian, I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I had reflected and understood that I would also support animal aquaculture.
That's why my decision is going to go wrong.
At the moment, I had the impression on her side of mismut, then she defended vegetarianism and thought that she knew where her flesh came from and that she would be reduced as a vegetarian animal.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly trapped as a vegan in a corner and that conflicts arise without it being caused.
There is a harmonious Veganer (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# is not bound by the legal requirements to be set aside.
I'm on the given date at which #PRS_ORG# my return doesn't take place.
Since I can't be present because of an injury, it can't change either.
Please allow me to grant an alternative term of withdrawal.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I'm going to meet again.
Lainsteiner Wehr equipped for water treatment: 45,000 euros from the country
Recently, Rheinland-Pfalsian Interior Minister Roger Liventz in Lahnsteine Rathaus issued an application decision of EUR 45,000 for the new vehicle for the direction of the voluntary firefighting of Lahnstein to Oberbürger Master Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle used since November 2020 shall be EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Pafalz supports us here," said Mr. Lahnsteins Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the shower staff of Lahnstein, one of the seven units in the Rhineland Pfalz.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice management as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you are constantly counting on increasing revenues: the tree of the hotel ship on Rhein and Mosel as well as the increasing use of the wage as a free flow.
I bought me a book that I could only read to 10% and then encountered the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, in their recommendations, they have synced, removed, and the newly loaded NICHTS app has worked.
I'm tired of something because the whole operation has been spending a lot of time and hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter a term in the order procedure?

Thank you for taking the whole thing up here for the first time, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, and we were also gunmen in the executive, and I do not want to get involved in it!
The question on the right and on the left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the public service comes from the liberal and conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary links that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and weaponry of humans right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can deal with the reality they have lived with, of course, it is also clear that you have, of course, in addition to the average white, although many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and that is why I am not now the superimposed feminist school, because it is in the executive that there are less than half the ordinary men and women who are not aware of it if they do not tell it) and I can also leave myself to these people because in doubt they will save your life or set this for you.
However, even if these border groups are the first time comically listening to my experience after a conservative stand, they are proud of Germany and feel less ashamed of their left-wing policy, even if this policy is likely to be used for them or if it means to make them right, they simply want to be treated in a normal manner.
Back to the rights, since of course the police and the fighting forces are also a cross-border society, extreme rights will also be found there, but they can tell their opinion there or even damage any plans that threaten the state is medialy overextended and threatening me too.
Of course, it is also true that police and soldiers who were often employed abroad were often slowing down because of negative experiences, and sometimes they say that the opponents are politically wrong.
There is also the fact that even right-wing family members are involved in a wide range of exchanges of ideas.
However, this is how I think it is well fought and it is also opposed to political education and clarification!
Germany is so internationally frustrated and this is also so good for me that we could not afford it at all to have right racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, which I don't understand, the other basket I ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold.
I've already ordered it in November.
But I was confirmed in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've had a lot of time with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# Corb for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or it is available anywhere in Germany.
I'm always looking for you as a partner company.
But above the edge of the wood, there are two deep jars full of gels.
and on the mirror itself is a small cracker
Ordered by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been working on a matter for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (in private, very little time), but I have been able to lead my life more badly than right to my budget permanently and properly.
There are always stages in which everything remains, and then when it packs up and I clean up.
But it's never really that "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband (leader) is not even better, although it disturbs me anywhere but most of the lost budget simply against work and unemployment.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cooked as we like to cook.
Now, on my question, have you been able to make things better with a child?
But we have nothing to do with it, and this question has been working on me for a long time.
Because for me, I have no response, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and for example, it's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is useful.
Do you and your child have a bigger argument or do you stay awake?
I'm glad to hear your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitative high-quality as well as anatomically designed cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect passform and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Careers in social work - as someone with a self-sustained personality disorder?
I've been training in software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I see more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, because I have been too slow to start again and to study social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a more self-sustaining (e.g. technically avoiding) personality disorder (e.g. ÄVPS).
That means grossly saying that I have no sense of self-esteem and that I am accordingly vulnerable.
I have no problem talking to people at a certain level, but it seems to me to have very difficult conversations and I was told earlier that I was unsatisfied (where I believe I have become better).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth field, but rather in seeking advice or family assistance.
However, I do not know whether the actual day of work is really the way I think it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it makes me down every time there's something on my code ("just a simple thing") and I find it difficult to ask experienced colleagues to help ("I should know between myself how it goes"/ "I keep him with my stupid questions from work"/ "I really need to keep myself under control" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in any profession, but I wanted to mention them in the place.
But you've already stopped the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for it either.
I'm waiting for a deadline for recovery
What do you mean, give her back?
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# message will not authenticate this book
Is there a problem?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had a delivery confirmation for my stomach.
The egg (protein) that is added to the feed puts the bird in its stomach-darm tray into the individual egg-plants (aminosic acids) and builds its body-shaped egg, which he also needs for feeding.
The training of feeding in Nestling and the training of feeding in breeding birds is extremely complex and is linked to a particularly high claim for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be taken during pregnancy, as there may be other disturbances in breast milk.
In addition to this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (miniral preparation) should be re-examined.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml Water or 100 g soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water as the bird consumes daily and to exchange water/foots daily.
A narrow measuring valve (inlet) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In severe food damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be given at the start until the use of food retraining is visible.
The normal dose will then be reached until breast-feeding is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without solar radiation between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can a desk be bought after 9 months?
The insurance claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to announce that my order was damaged and images were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a Community co-rapporteur in the statement of appeal to the Council
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I've got the next problem.
On our ground, a Walnus tree is to be liked.
So case law was placed in the community.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the Walnus are not part of the planting.
However, the Walnuss is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I now leave myself to the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to leave myself on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the setting is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get any messages
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Can you offer me a present or a present?
So, what were they more expensive?
Yes, I think the only question is whether I can pay in euro and give me the deck to Germany
Can you check it out?
Notification: Heavy traffic accidents at self
Before long, a serious traffic accident occurred on St. 2179 between the port of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police press alarm now announced (14:03 am), a Pkw arrived in the opposite direction.
There's damage.
I understand.
Well, then many thanks again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas for further careers
First Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is rather good because my favorite head just remembers everything you can remember.
Before I get out here, I need advice and the best of people who know my situation somewhere - so from you.
I'm just making the ref as a Quereinsteger.
Initially, I studied something else and worked there too in a field (to stay a little anonymous at least, I don't know anything else here).
But all of this was too long for me, and I've been looking for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At the time, I was very impressed with the doctrine and I was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are clearly more flexible than in my previous profession, but that was not my fault.
I've come to the third "I'm googling other descriptions" now.
And it's only a half year away.
In the past, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, and then I can still change.
But that's exactly what I'm done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I've been completely released.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I would be stressed, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday.
That's where I was free.
And the stress on the work was not at all at the moment.
Now I have too much stress for myself.
And then there are these strange structures that make me more nervous.
In principle, it makes fun and looks outside, the ref also runs well with regard to the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely relieved and ask myself how much stress my body holds before it completely closes - if he doesn't just do it.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my life in this way - just if I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, as I was valued, I could take free time if I needed it, and find the job somewhere long, but it was well paid and together in a team that worked and not as a individual fighter as it is now most time of the case.
But then I ask myself whether I have not come back to the same place in a year, as I am now and disappointed.
You notice, it's all wrong somewhere, but maybe you have as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation that I'm completely finished and almost start with the smallest thoughts about it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and pardoning the wine undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become a little clearer at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, which has led to, inter alia, the combination of advanced modelling technology with the Valve Reactor, which will perfectly reflect the behaviour of a rotary booster.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we propose a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely on the latest state of technology in the case of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and amplifications, the VTX reinforcements are waiting for an authenticity which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also include of course the multi-stamped Valvetronix-Röhren.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because they are more easily accessible to the sound variations and innovations of a noise booster than any simulation.
In addition to this ignition, the VTX booster offers a closed house and a base reflex system, from which the natural resonances are only so sprayed.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and avoid historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always presented them.
The perfect combination of Röhren sound with modelling technology is to be considered in the first line of the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times in order to also meet new added sound requirements, which anno 2010 has again led to a service shop of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamic as well as more and significantly improved booster models.
From hand-held VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will be finished looking for a maximum sound range here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamics of a noise booster: they expect a tight sound, a renewed display of play dynamics and saitanschlag as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have found that, in particular, the endpoints determine the characteristics of a booster and developed the VOX Valve reactor technology using this knowledge.
The Valve Reactor activation of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 pipe consists of the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a piper.
NBA: Still 20 points from Wagner: Magic Loss at Clippers
The Dutch series of Orlando Magic is held in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can smooth - to win against the Los Angeles Clippers, however, it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven figures of his older brother Moritz, the magic was lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individual place- and fall-off-lock parts, it is fully suited to the needs of your camera equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from wireless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflector cameras.
What finally fits in the back pocket depends of the size of the camera and the object.
A possible possession would be a DSLR camera with a specified object, two to three switch objects and a cover.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 allow room for more objects.
In addition, you can still understand any amount of resources.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the back pocket for his equipment and for photo-friendly things.
Drohnen pilots also meet with the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, as the Rucksack offers adequate space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote handling and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
Within a few months of the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is the end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 was 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island before the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has taken something away in the past days, but Vulcanologists are still not expecting any predictions when it can end.
The indicators point to a delay.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the State TV sender RTVE.
Hazards in the millions of heights
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of lava has destroyed nearly 2200 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metro-dikes lavaschicht.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage would be estimated at more than €900 million.
Before the coast, two new settlements were created with a size of about 50 hectares.
In particular, it was seriously affected by the very important banana plant for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and who already lived before the volcanic eruption in the crisis.
225 hectares of banana plants were destroyed, further areas were strongly affected, the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is ahead of the door and especially the children will soon be able to wait for the heavenly party.
The many beautiful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the clumsy tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that our increasingly divided society still holds together.
It is therefore more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of the scene so that the gesture of the scene, which after French sociologists and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peaceful "Society Treaty of Natural Peoples", will be rescinded and will be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Did the Christy Be Made From Nikolaus?
The protestors, who were closely associated with the petition on Christmas Day, were arrested.
Before the day of Nikolasag gifts were transferred to one type or another.
The background of this still popular seat today is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra had three women secretly thrown gold into her window one night to save them from further life in sin.
From this non-conventional form of the snow, the popular noise in Germany was first to fill the snowflakes, especially the children with gifts.
Protestants came to this need because they refused to be mediator between God and men as a "sacrifice of holiness".
For these reasons, they do not object to the institution.
Martin Luther made Christ the child from Nikolaus and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of the grant is therefore on the saint.
Since most Protestants do not see such details as much more, it only regrets the least that the use of St. Nicholas is similar to the use of Martinsingen and Martinsummuk is still a solid part of the pre-dating night.
Today, you can find in chairs before the door and under the Christmas tree of Socken until you want to enjoy all that the heart desires.
Many of the traditions in Christian countries
Sources are a tradition of the shadow since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the reform, the day of the scene moved to the sanctuary.
However, in all professed Christian countries, a happy breakfast model is presented on the question of who is now bringing gifts to children.
In Germany, it depends on whether the child of Christ appears on the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who has been assigned some types of property in time.
This includes, for example, his white appearance, which has only a little more common with the stricter acidity of the historical figure, his conclusions drawn from renting and the preference of the stone to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Saint Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy it is the Hexe Befana that should have shown them the way to Jesus' child.
In Scandinavia, the gifts were made by both table beings, while in Russia it brought VAT to a place of rest.
There are not renters here, but three horses that take his castles as Troika.
In Chechnya, the mother country of the reform in the course of the Hussitten War, the Christian child is responsible for the gift delivery.

Pillent problem
Hello, you love women.
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually saving my first post after a year.
To my problem: I had to start again about five years ago to take the pill, especially because I had such unbelievable pain during the period and PMS had before the period.
Now I'd like to keep it back, because I need to take enough medication from chronic diseases that I can't look for.
My main problem, not surprisingly the pain, but my skin.
At my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickel and all of it.
As far as it's over, but I've been through it so well and I haven't really felt it.
In the two-year break, it has never really standardized itself.
Maybe there's some kind of tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are free and free of charge, but maybe there's something that can be recommended to me.
I'm sorry I didn't take it so seriously and Hautarzt's term is still coming.
Thank you very much for everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, love skin is such a thing.
Vorbuperter had bad neurodermitis, then a time of peace, then large-scale bone patch and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything I can to eat in the course of Chrysan disease, and I have remained dependent on sugar, milk and meats mixed costs, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that hormones are simply the worm in there, but if you want to keep up with all my constructions, you don't want to go looking for anything else that's still moving.
I've already had all of her colleague's homework.
I wrote and now I lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my case.
I have to work between you and the phone and it was suddenly all gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe it was something wrong.
But it's generally big.
because it is available in black

110 kV earth cable is newly built 2022
The authorisation for the release of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The Government's decision to set up the Netherlands will open the way for construction to begin in 2022.
It was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long earth cable is connected to the Tann respan network in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt direction between Simmbach and the parishes.
The cable is connected to the site of Edermanning at Reut to a mass of liberation.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with order #NUMBER# has just arrived in parts with us.
The blue number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipping #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Set not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A beautiful start in the week!
You can forget that I explained several times yesterday!!
This is a piece of glass and the whole pages are placed, so there is all the glass and the cardboard is cut
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the commode can't be removed because no one in my apartment can be clean.
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books because the question at #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem
Ref: Education plans (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I've still got a lot of problems to plan my teaching in the field of geology.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also copy only s/w free of charge (which is nerve to the earth).
I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of gefactors, and I really have every hour for myself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I also do not want to invest too much time for simple hours of education (which I need for UBs, etc.).
I'm actually going from the point of study (what I want to achieve) and then I'm going to think about how I can build it (mostly I create a working paper with texts from books that don't have my school).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am more unhappy.
That's why the paper too.
Maybe I can work with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I'd like to give the #PRS_ORG# back from #Numberer# order.
I actually have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to turn the return as quickly as possible for the first time.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation on Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who are infected or hated.
The transaction holds it unnecessary and regrettably intrusive.
A possible solution has also been prepared.
The 2G regimes are losing the important Christmas business in view of Germany's trade-related (HDE) trade.
In dealing with articles of non-daily need, it would be to blame the abuses, criticised HDE chief business leader Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written the Christmas business.
"What should be the positive height of the year is often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions therefore lost almost a third of their pre-crisis rates during the past week.
Good work is only in food trade and online.
The link called for the consequences of dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief business leader.
"2G is no longer bringing us into the fight against the pandemic when shopping," he stressed.
The current arrangements were broken down by customers and required high staffing.
The banking system had to be approved by the federal authorities, he asked.
Then each customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (impact or genetic) and had access to all business with the banks that were received on that day.
In addition, in retail trade - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (impact, genetic or tested) - samples should be sufficient.
The German Euroshop real estate companies specialized in shopping centres also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last are without 2G in good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the turnover at about 90 percent.
These figures will now become safe in the middle of such important Christmas business," said President Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Because of the high personal and administrative expenditure, the Centre will try to find solutions and allow it to obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, where "the visitors, for example at a central point in the centre, can once produce their 2G signal and then - equipped with a band like in a club hotel - can hold all business".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a cracker and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to hide with a yellow filling.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and added it.
How am I supposed to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour performance.
For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of light there are two standard colour temperatures: daily light and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and store the colour temperature in the area of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the Flash storage.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitionable.
The light creates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flammable.
The display angle of 120 degrees, with which you can light large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
Also in reporting situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or on the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller enables the remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted at difficult locations.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of keys and a lighting display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is still the slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery volume)
User Memory The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to implement the settings of the individual settings on the storage sites, simply one of the storage keys is printed and ready by longer pressure.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp on activation, so that when new activations, the known situation is restored - Very practical in studio work when the camera is set at certain color temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of the company with valuable NP-F Akkus.
These are often already in possession of photographs and camera changes (and women) - so you can return to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the battery has sufficient performance - it is a battery test equal to the built-in - for each of the two batteries a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right of the lower display).
In addition, it is, of course, possible to provide the scanners with electricity over the network provided.
The construction of the scanner is very easy.
You have a 16mm hole as an attachment to confirm, so you can direct your photostatic.
The refusal shall be made reliable by means of the determination of both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high and are therefore based on longevity and hard use.
In addition, a new link is included in the delivery volume.
It is great that also contains a bag in the delivery volume.
This allows you to buy the lights with all the accessories you want to buy, if possible, without safe transportation or storage.
The damage I have received and it is too small:(
"Party that we wanted to smile": Frankfurt celebrates a great comeback against Liverkusen
What a spectacular reaction to Frankfurt entry.
After 22 minutes, the last two seats in series were on the road to next Bundesliga.
But then the SGE woke up, and within a good hour the fruit came up over an extended season start of the soul and kissed Furios with 5:2. "It's a joy what the boys have done today," retired trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal Lob, to every individual who was with it," said.
At first, it looked after a renewed buffer for the Frankfurters who are now at rank nine, as they expected.
Patrick Schick had led the delivery crew with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back then and showed a fantastic performance," said Glasner.
I am truly happy with the performance that we have shown and of course also with the result.
The moral of his teammates was also impressed by the role played by the rapist Christopher Lenz, who was able to be back on the scene for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcrowded muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a view to the results particularly for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to smile today.
For the next tasks, though, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he is also well aware of the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top-work in our medical department, but the players also live high-professionally.
Now you want to "go further and keep track of progress" and the tasks until the year-to-year change "take over to this level".
The next weekend, in the course of the English week, there is an outdoor game at Borusia Mönchengladbach (18.30 am, Sky) on the program.
I'll be able to get the mail back to you because of a mistake on my side.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it go, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again, or do I have to wait until the money has been sent back and the order is given again?
I'd be sorry if I didn't order it again because it's been a long time.
Have they ever been fed on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Samples for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany's Handball Women, after the demolition against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the park.
At the end of the WM main round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) spent 800 visitors in Granollers a severe decline and must now be against guests in Spain in the quarter-end.
"We were too strict and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Hank Greener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first landing in the tournament Germany closed the main group III with 8:2 points as second behind the teeth (10:0).
It's bad we couldn't take the flow.
It was a bad game for all of us to delete," said Captain Emily.
In the fight to enter the semi-final, there must be a significant increase in the next Tuesday against the WM-second of 2019 in order to maintain the sharp dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German vorferin in the duel with the three-dimensional Olympic Denmark was the backroom player Alina Grieseels with six towers.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the riot," said the actor Xenia Smits, and asked: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
From front to back, not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German man with the attack was not on the height.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and leaks in the reverse were responsible for a quick 0:4 return after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and stopped with some parades.
The first tower reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grissels successfully completed a quick resistance.
However, this was not the expected initial education.
Against the aggressive coverage of the dins, the German women were hardly able to put themselves in a scene - and, however, they were usually separated from the strong Althea Reinhardt in the corner of the Scandinavians.
So the party was running early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since the backroom player Mia Zschocke was seen shortly later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
However, in the fourth term, they may be active again.
First in the final phase of the first half time, the DHB selection was something better in the game and up to at least five doors.
The only hope for a wake-up after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greener defenses in all fields and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is counting on the media candidates at the end of the round.
As a result, the German crew could no longer reach a performance increase and went as a clear lossr from the park.
DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during Christmas
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have adopted the Nikolay Day and have taken the opportunity to celebrate family traditions during the Christmas season, the Advent, Nikolaus, the Holy Day and Christmas celebrations.
How was that at home?
How about your partner?
Do you want to continue your traditions to your children?
What's the best for the kids?
The scissors?
Placebacks?
Tree beauty?
Is it music?
Is the Christmas man, the Christian boy, or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone surrenders and around Christmas May, it's as nice as possible to have as a family.
Whether these are now fixed traditions, or even every year something else: tell us how it works in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help.
Confirmation... etc
I'd like to get a good sign code
as at #PRS_ORG# gives flashlights
Is that what's going on with them?
The title suggests that I have been involved as an implant in mobile vaccination teams, in which (as a matter of fact) the bioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being infected in nursing homes.
As these are soon ready for a large part, then it goes on to the part in Immunization centers for me.
I would like to answer questions without temporary limitation on the organisational and human aspects and also medical issues if they are not addressed to a person (e.g. "I take medicine X, it's against impeding.").
In my task area, the statement for the imputation, the indication (People have no claim for an infection under Corona vaccination and no reasons to speak against it), medical documentation and, in particular, emergency care in allergic reactions (I have not yet passed).
The impunging itself is delegateable to qualified staff, such as medical exchangers.
In vaccine teams, however, we often have no "only" (God wants no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines that cannot perform (may I?), so I do most of the injections myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a hiidler, please?
With this dialect response, sent by amerger, we have been provided in the BR television series "We in Bayern" for strong thoughts.
However, unlike many previous days, the term remained unchanged from the call "Host mi?" this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, 'cause everything has to go fast.'
What people heard from the TV moderator was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg announced the solution, and he must have been worried about many of the surprises.
"The skinler," the viewers experience, "is a lamp with which someone wipes the mouth."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bayer's television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note, this is a typical over-the-favoured term, it is somehow derived from the well-known word "hudern".
Where education was closed - perhaps even in the Ethicals who have been living in the room Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
The following error message is always received after confirmation: oops - something goes wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, re-started, synced and repaired with the PC.
Nothing has helped.
Are you sure you're not sure about the racer?
This morning, I was very excited because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare my driver's license in the coming week.
I said, done, and I went with my racer that I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then it happened what is happening in every such town (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, laurel scissors and my backrests didn't want to make the rest of the track any more.
Since I had no real opportunity because of the weekend, I had to rewind half the bad wages and take the first train home.
Well, it wasn't that bad, too, maybe it's better if I do it again before the wheel shift.
But now I'm standing in front of a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long track over a few days ahead of me, I would be more likely to have this problem.
Now it was really not bad because even the old tires from the predecessor (very nicer old man, on the day that I got the bike to take off up to 14 h 120km!) and he had already called it subtropical because he had been dangerous for years with them.
But if I think I have to take another turn when driving to 80-90km, then I think I'm really badly run :D
Now I have come to a conversation with an old man at the train station who wondered why I wouldn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be uncomplicated.
Now, of course, the whole sounds very exciting.
But are these really so incapacitable?
I have little fun now to issue 40€/reaps just to get discouraged.
I continue to ask myself: at the moment on the race, I believe 25x622.
However, there is also (probably?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already larger.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me at a racer on other tyres?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and love grace!
Car raced against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was told on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for some unexplained reason and then said on the opposite road, as the police told him.
There it came to a front row with a 27-year-old vehicle.
At the age of 53, the car was locked up against a tree and the man was put in the car.
The 27-year-olds as well as their 23-year-olds were severely injured in the accident and brought into surrounding hospitals.
Yes, we have deleted all books again and loaded new books

After the publication of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get back to adulthood.
SOLO 15 is the new sprössling and optically reminds the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design foot is included directly in order to refer the speaker to the correct voice position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle is that SOLO 15 is very good for people who play a more sub-ordered role, but is supposed to achieve an extraordinary high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce nearly unfiltered large sludge.
However, this does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, they are very mature and are extremely impressive and precise for their size.
Tonal was approved the SOLO 15 with a slight high altitude.
This is generally used in broadband to optimise the very high frequencies of strongly increasing association.
The SOLO 15 is very clear and fine sound.
Lightly driven outside can reduce the height area and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimum stereodreyk is a messic and exciting precision.
The extremely low mechanical losses of B 100 - 6 OHM provide for an enemy dynamic that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 supplements not only our SOLO series, but it expands resolution and accuracy in matters.
As with all our construction sets, it is recommended to start thinking about the final optic of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction process.
For example, if you want to provide the house, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the Furnier is again presenting material.
After all the plates have been cut off (e.g. in the construction market), you should first move an 8-mm hole into the ground floor at the appropriate location in order to carry out the cable safely later.
With the help of an overfraction, the voice opening in the front is now possible so that B 100 - 6 OHM can be used properly later.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to design the opening area of the speaker chair within as large as possible.
The B 100-6 OHM’s four intersection points have a break in the phase, as shown in the “Detail Phase” image.
Then you start with the actual building of the box and place one of the two side walls on the same surface.
On these are now the back vans, the decks, the front and the floor.
The three fittings should also be used and worn.
For example, if you want to get back from the construction market instead of producing 16 mm of MDF, you can change the size of the packaging itself if necessary.
The second page is presented in the next step of work.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, so the both sides, and the front.
The opening of the bass reflux tube, as well as the connector on the back wall, shall be made easier by means of a suitable loop or a forest driller.
Next, you use a round tree to cover all sides of the actual box.
The surface of the disc can also be rounded up.
In addition, the foot plate is fixed with the foot of the house and is attached with long wooden screws.
It follows the markings and forwards (2,5-mm-bohrer) of the interfering points of the speaker chassis and the connectors.
After cleaning the house of wood dust (abstain/disperse), you begin with the setting of the cable.
This is most easily achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex open in the backyard.
With this, you can skip the entire and unshorted cable piece for pieces through the 8 mm hole in the foot until the terminal opens and it can stand out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the house, the cable is used to open the voice and it can also be locked up there.
The frequency range shall be prepared and used below.
The design plan of the frequency ranges, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: assembly instructions soft Solo 15.
If the frequency range is built up and the connection terminal is broken, the cover of the 8 mm cable opening in the box, which is not completely closed yet.
With the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with a message, you can drop a lift on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the cover accordingly.
Now the depression follows the description.
Next, the B 100-6 OHM is connected and sealed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the pulse (marked cable) on the speaker's pulse (larger contact) must be activated.
To conclude, the bassreflexr is cut and attached to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
To be swallowed, a matte of the steaming material is cut into two parts and distributed into the housing.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I give you an order even now and let you deliver first June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we also reorganise the OSCAST this year!
> We are unable to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which has meant a higher planning challenge and explains the short-term duration of the announcement.
AVER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 bunks in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But, hey, it's as before Pandemie – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as long as possible.
> It's going to be around 0:30.
Make you a cold drink, plant good food and make you ready for a long time, but very interesting night.
