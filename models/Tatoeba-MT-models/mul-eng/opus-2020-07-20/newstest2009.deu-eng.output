The Prager Börse argues against the business union in the minority.
After the sudden fall in the morning, the Prague Börse could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal business of the day.
The Prague Börse was linked at the beginning of the day's business at the beginning of the Monday, when they paid for another six percentage points.
This time there was the reason for entering the Wall Street.
In Czech countries, the market's response to the result of the vote of the US Representative's House, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector in question, is also reflected in the Czech Republic.
Whether the action is enabled in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday the shares of the bears in Asia, although the indexes could match some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Song Börse index lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to make part of the losses, thus reducing the return to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Song China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares at the Towers in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 per cent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the banks in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased by 4.3 percent.
The beers in Taiwan pay 3.6 percent after that index.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and the financial markets will be affected worldwide," said the Head of Finance in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, so independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move to the same level as those in the United States.
The US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to the words of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt the draft to support the financial system.
Others fear that other countries would also be affected by the outbreak.
A bloodbath of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the financial system's support plan on Monday, for which up to $700 billion (up to 12 million Kč) should be applied.
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush's view of the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important shares index recorded the largest inflow in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index gave about seven percent, a similar intrusion he recorded last year in 1987.
The index was already broken before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not be passed on in the House of Commons, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes a statement: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
This will be agreed at the beginning of next week.
In discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the US financial system, the US legislators reached a gap of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion dollars).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The members of the Congress must discuss some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the adoption of the Act.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank of Reuters, said this.
In the Senate, different details could be agreed on the plan by midweek at the earliest possible time.
Economics should therefore be informed that the plan will be adopted, the first of which is a significant psychological factor for the development of financial markets.
But then it comes to a "reduction" because of complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a package for the stabilization of the market should look," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
As a result of your words, it could still come to a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of non-sellable mortgage assets from financial corporations that are threatening financial firms in severe losses and the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You still have to continue the health plan, but I think we're the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also very low in the stock markets, which are very low.
The words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, were, as a result, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement on Sunday at the Congress.
That is why we want to slow down investment in Asian financial markets, which are in the first phase, where a decision of the Congress could affect business on Monday.
In the meantime, however, it is not quite clear that when both chambers of the American Congress are voted on by law, there is also uncertainty as to whether negotiations can not be resolved in the last minute.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will experience some further changes.
The total amount allocated to the system should be divided into two parts.
The original 350 billion dollars will be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
The Congress, however, can block the discharge of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, although at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush values progress in positive negotiations
Although the President has a veto law in this decision, the Congress can vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the program’s reasons remain, which is based on funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, which have fallen short of value, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush also showed satisfaction with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush would be satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden random screens
The President of the Banking Committee of Sentat Christopher Dodd, the leading contractor, agreed that the legislators would be responsible for the money programme, the protection of the taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law should also restrict the golden screens for directors of companies involved in the programme and appoint a committee to oversee the Fund.
These should lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan is also designed to help home owners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should address new rates of mortgages that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtor and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patricia Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And for that reason, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets are bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek’s view is not exclusive.
"It is much more important that the Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as quickly as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to adoption is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Double on Messers Cut: MP3-Player against phones.
We advise you when you choose
While almost any mobile MP3 file can be played, no MP3 player can still be dialed.
That's why, of course, it's better to buy just a phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should hire a private player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owners.
You will find it difficult to buy a great expensive disc player for home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it either.
However, if you have LPs with Type Rock, Jazz or Blues in general, you probably dream of at least one of them.
So it is also expressed with music on travel, so with compressed music, simply - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to give out thousands of crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd-Fan will probably be able to force headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each room.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good Music Players can play much more than just music, but what they can do on the phone doesn't even make them stop.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the syms, it can repeat music and videos, take both, it has a better one, sometimes a worse camera, and maybe it can navigate.
And if you're still involved in smartphones and communications, you've got almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can crack and no TV camera.
However, the universality of the telephones also brings with it traces.
The more you use your phone, the more often you will have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy coolers.
Just a few phones can play music longer than ten or twelve hours, but it's usually much less.
In this regard, Music Player (especially the simplest) are clearly useful.
Therefore, you should count on cheap phones so that they can no longer play music for more than a few hours.
Then, if you turn off and call again, you will be able to buy more security storage equipment for the office - that is also applicable to more expensive devices.
When MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep up at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one upload.
Another problem is if you want to play music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the device has a USB shutdown, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card reading devices will be completed without reduction with the win winch memory cards used on phones.
You do not need any special software until you remove (iPod) from your player.
You only need to feed the device through USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players even place a music library, arranged by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address list, like the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating systems).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should explore, in particular, after the lifetime of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the service comfort.
If you have music for you, especially kulise and listen to them every day just briefly in the street, then there's enough phone for you to play MP3 files.
What really can almost every phone can do.
They also do not have to control specifically which music formats can process a phone or a player.
All MP3 create, and the most music you get will be in this format.
The format belongs to the most popular, and in addition most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format, the Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to call the relevant pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already be a powerful argument for why you should wear a musical handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and limited to fast radio.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is clear that this kind of sale of music (such as GSM, Internet or wireless) will in the future govern the music industry.
The phone takes most of them.
If you have fun listening to something, pick up the phone in the jackent bag while the player is home.
However, it comes to whether you are always headphones or at least a wireless open-word device.
If not, you can access the integrated speakers, which has almost every phone, but only the smallest MP3 players.
The greatest advantage of music handys will be available for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you already have a perfectly competent Walkman.
The largest handle will be for most that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically equipped telephones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The player's advantage is again in the easy service.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar to those used with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the disc player is visible.
There is no collusion in the form of an irrevocable mobile Internet and a subsequent alarming account for data transmission.
Which device should be used now
Also the most cheap phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, there are two thousand crowns.
But look.
The base models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy another priced MP3 player, then you can get to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
If you are able (max. 2 GB) then you do not have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
If you belong to the demanding audiences, take more specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have their own service keys for MP3, and the service comfort comes to the individual MP3 player.
Above all, there is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interfaces as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category from up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with the MP3 player of the manufacturer mentioned above.
The first virtual tenderer is already coming to Czechia this year.
Maybe
The mobile function market in Chechnya is right, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic prices to be lower.
Maybe this isn't gonna be waiting for a long time.
That the Czech mobile service providers are working at the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÜ telecommunications authority, who pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, it is likely to be a paradox - for some of the Czech mobile providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than home.
How is it that the prices in Chechnya are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a struggle.
Maybe it sounds paradoxic, but there are three mobile networks in Chechnya and a penetration of more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are pleased to note that there is very much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÜ) is often also responsible for the fact that, in the past, Pavel Dvorák, who had often claimed that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with a own network no longer has many special opportunities (otherwise he would probably not even find frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought a significant price reduction with which the classic mobile operators had to respond.
Prior to the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in Britain, there were similar votes like in Chechnya.
However, it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
On the other hand, you don't have to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider mobileking in Poland.
In just a half year, this provider was able to win over 100 thousand customers and thus raise to the country’s fifth largest bidder.
Behind the movement is the Penta financial group, which is located in Czechia under other U:fon.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually go out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, however, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of mobileking in Poland shows, it can also be a good idea to put on an uncluttered target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Really select your mobile phone - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be found in Chechnya.
In addition, Vodafone's press speaker Miroslav Čepický says: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment, based on which most virtual suppliers are based.
In addition, it has been relatively adjusted from the point of view of the service offer."
In Czech no chance, I mean the mobile phone providers
But it's almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider overloads Czechia, this won't be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czech countries do not look very optimistic.
It will come to a market entry of mobileking in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, a press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile phone providers in Czechia are not particularly suitable for this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor exists.
Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone provider has been shown for a long time by the GTS Novera group, who wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in providing our customers not only online but also mobile telephone telecommunications services.
And you're older, that's better.
On this opportunity, we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we were already able to make negotiations," said the press speaker of the group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until then, however, this is surrounded by an unsurpassed wall of the village.
"At this moment we do not conclude that there is a place for a complete virtual provider in Chechnya.
The Czech market shows great specificity to other markets.
Until then, we have not yet spoken to any subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
The Czech market specifics also show other suppliers.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare way to the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to be built on."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobiles, a virtual provider will hardly appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we must have a concrete offer to think so briefly."
Vodafone focuses his attention on meeting the requirements of his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický means: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing of costs and infrastructure.
That's why we considered this to be the best view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The process of mobile service providers is easy to understand, a further provider was more competitive, which would result in lower prices and also a return of profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor facilitate market access?
That the providers can draw on a string when it's about something, it's also about the long hint and her about the creation of U:fon.
The most powerful pressure in the direction of ČTÜ went to the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This includes the public information available on the ČTÜ websites.
Now, however, it is appropriate to use U:fon as an argument why a virtual provider should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition field of the mobile function market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile function provider.
Given the character of the mobile function market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new operator would put high demands on the market, especially on its services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just about the attitude of ČTÜ, which in Czech countries, in contrast to the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the ability to engage in economic competition.
This only holds the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this was his very typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after it has come to a contractual agreement between a mobile provider and a virtual provider on the provision of the necessary infrastructure.
Until then, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not of sufficient interest to the classic suppliers," so in his reply to our request, Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the UOHS.
This would not be surprising by the representatives of the tenderers.
This is more than a matter of concern to an authority that represents the consumer's interests and, above all, that no one is using his position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual providers work very normally, it is to be noted that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is quite surprising that the three mobile operators who respond to their reactions have almost been able to respond.
The question of whether it is really just an accident is on hand.
Just as the absolute same gas price at the tanks is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence in this regard referring to a counter-competitive action, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile function market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa pointed out in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÜ, after telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position inside.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the entry of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider has the monopol for his network.
This means that he adopts a dominant position in a particular segment as necessary.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, at least it should be a warning to the UOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
In this regard, a number of stakeholders (including the said company GTS Novera) complained that they were very opposed to negotiations with all suppliers.
The discharge of the responsibility to the ČTÜ is then a right-of-the-art trip in the telecommunications services, which distances the ÚOHS from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible for the recently adopted novels of the telecommunications law to extend the ČTÜ's competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must only know that very well, but they probably have different interests.
It's already done when no one's threatened
The operation of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are more than one in the Czech mobile networks, remains unattended for the first time.
There are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
This is normally the case for companies that act in the field of multilevel marketing.
Personal mobile telephone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only to be selected.
The knowledge of the matter is that the company acts against the operator as a classic company client who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a more important customer, you will then receive special offers of price (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit a similar type of retail sale.
"If there are any cases you describe, then there can be a breach of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal with what can lead to an end of cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová answered to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not happen to the operators of mobile phones.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers can be dealt with.
However, no operator would object to such a procedure.
From the activities of these companies, they are not affected by the fact that they are not expected to win, at the same time they are not affected by the actual official market, unlike the actual virtual suppliers.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: "The law enables such types of speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a very low percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM cards do not run on their behalf on their phone, so they can't fully have them as the normal customers of mobile phone providers."
But that was the only thing that had to happen at least rarely.
A further question for the UOHS is also open.
If the mobile phone providers decide to close their eyes before such a process, why stop them against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚohS has a very strong competence to detect such activities, and if it does not wish, it does not have to be satisfied with the offerer's statement, they knew nothing of it and their business conditions would prevent it from being satisfied.
When the checkout is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual suppliers brought a significant drop in prices in the various services.
This has been done practically in all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence in practice more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, or too much a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the highly developed countries, the regulatory bodies, not the interests of mobile operators, are taking place right now, but their customers are trying to prove their interests.
Whether by formal measures or by non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and followed up.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies have turned the whole case into a hot cardboard.
As far as our experiences are concerned, we cannot imagine that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more valuable than any other.
But we don't throw the flints into the corner.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is soon discovered, the Czech mobile market may soon be re-inforced.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to dismissing other stakeholders (to discriminate).
And finally, the Czechs will not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best out
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national dynamics.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recording of the National Hymne where my home country is on the day of the Czech state in one hour.
The Hymne was newly introduced by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bélohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologes, in body formation and in an instrumental version.
The recording was taken by Katerín Knížínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnen versions are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can also listen to all four versions.
For Bélohlávek, the Czech National League is one of the most beautiful Himms.
Earlier he had told the Czech Roundfunk that he had chosen for the Solo variants with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried both and then with the Chor to keep a clear dictionary so that you can understand the text well so that an agreement can be made," said the director.
In the next year, the Czech National Hymmes will be the 175th anniversary.
The song Kde domov myj first explained in 1834 at the stage of the station theater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was produced by Frantisek Škroup.
It became popular, and people adopted it spontaneous.
The first strip of the League was then formed in 1918 after the formation of Czechoslovakia into an organic part of the National Hymme.
One of the seven symbols remained after the birth of the Czech Republic itself.
How the New Hymme sounds
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday for the first time on a chip.
The Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will enter into the history of the Prague transport company as a date on which the first passengers will be admitted to a bus, train or bus, which will take an electronic coupon into the bag instead of a paper item.
These can now buy about a hundred thousand people who own the chip card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day, or an annual coupon (validly from 1 January 2009) and can also be displayed on their chip cards, including in the info centres and double stations of the transport companies at the U-road stations Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andël, Roztyly, Letnıny, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the website of the transport company www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was applied by over four hundred customers to the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the output window in the U-roads, where they had to wait regularly for long-term scraps on their paper fares.
They buy the Copon via the Internet, and this will be played on the opencard in one of the thirty-seconds of the city library.
"In these places, the passengers also have a locker with qualified staff, the Internet shopping agent, and the coupon on the map," said project speaker Martin Opatrní.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play electronic coupons on the opencard, which are included in some U-Bain valves.
How do these machines look?
They are red, remind of the train fares, the passengers may already have noticed in the railway stations Roztyly, Budéjovikká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eight years," adds Opatrní.
The coupon controls a car instead of the driver
It's easy to use the machines that will work from tomorrow.
You only have to enter the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons apply from morning to morning not only in the capital but also in the environment.
Thus, in the city and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, the inhabitants of the region's central cities arrived in the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the integrated transport to Prague, the accompanying reading devices are able to test the validity of the Copons by time and zone," explains Filip Drapal of the Organisation Ropid. This organisation combines the road plans for the Prague transport company.
The city buses have card reading devices at the driver’s seat.
When entering, the chip card must be displayed not only on the driver, but the opencard must be displayed at a marked location on the side of the box.
In this way the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a driver checks the validity of the played coupons, it is not easier for the driver to ask for this information," Drapal said.
A passenger who does not drive by city bus and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can then return to the self-service car where the coupons are displayed on the map.
Here the information about the validity of his documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Saudis asked the US for a referendum
In 1945, the South Indians sought to lead the Böhmerwald in the United States.
This is from a letter that is stored in the collections of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the U.S. government.
With such a desire, some groups of South-West Germans should have joined the US Presidents in 1945.
This is included in a letter previously received in a private archive, which is kept in the collections of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia today.
The Germans of Krumau, in the letter, ask the American Presidents to withdraw the "Sudetengaus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich Agreement by Hitler - to not allow the Czech Republic.
"We have correctly understood the situation and want to be sure that the American units do not belong to German oppression and enemy territory, but as freer," says a letter signed with the words "People whose fate is in the heart of the Saudis".
In view of the fact that the accession to the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic has convinced the Swedish people - in recognition of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, indiscriminateness, oppression, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American Presidents to take over, for today and forever, the protection powers over the Böhmerwald.
"We cannot believe that without looking back at a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you have spoken to a foreign state for us, oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities, and has not contributed to the victory of the Allieds," read in the letter.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is apparently the fear of the "Czech pressure list".
If the U.S. President had doubts about the opinion of the Böhmerwaldschen, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants of the United States wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of postwar history may sound somewhat naive, it is, in the opinion of some newspapers, a good picture of the expectations of the Southern Germans.
Even though the Germans had to at least not know that they would be negotiated on their withdrawal from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would deal with some sort of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they could just stay in the Czech Republic.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser Germaner at the sea on the Baltic Sea.
When he arrived at the end of the war in British prisons and was taken to Holstein in a war camp, thousands of other Germans came to him, and he was going to bring them in Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, they would be able to handle the Czechs," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Chechoslovakia had calculated his opinion that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Benez Decree.
You don't think so - then cry!
An emotional campaign is directed to motorists
The most animal action on the streets in Czech history.
Similarly, the emotionally charged media campaign was characterised, which the Ministry of Transport wanted to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš Rébíček promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the chain.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on planes.
It is intended to remove the driver from the driver’s driveway and alcohol from the tax.
And they also remember to get up before driving.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and not least professionals.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who appeal to emotions.
It also shows the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think so - then cry!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a sign.
And then there's the word "sell."
This should mean that you can pay a moment indiscriminately with your own life.
The spots will be "shocking" by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries where you can see very normal images with dramatic recordings of accidents.
It is promised to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic accidents on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by the Agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar broth and peats for the car driver
"For the driver, the motto sugar broth and peitsche is applicable.
Sugar break means that if they drive at red, for example, they save time.
The pit is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and, above all, negative advertising, means psychology.
Its opinion is less effective than tables that alert the driver to a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns of a danger, this will likely soon be affected by the environment, and the drivers will no longer take it anymore," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke virtually for the return of all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, if it could be concluded in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (placed) areas, if not all," Olmert said against the newspaper.
"We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli territories) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He concluded that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and, above all, do not want tractors or bulldozer to roll over their legs, as a best friend has done, will have to forget about a part of Jerusalem," observed Olmert in a play on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and thousands of people were killed.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old city.
"Those who want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 220,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he further confirmed.
Deduction of the Golan height
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which he considered to be an inevitable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
This would also require certain efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone and alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Highs," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians know only very well where they have to forget to get back to the Golan heights.
They will have to forget their current relationship with Iran; they will have to forget their relationship to Hisbollah movement; they will have to forget their continued support for the terrorism of the (Schitish) Hamas movement, the Al-Qaida network and the Dschyad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specified.
Questions after the accident: Are Stewarts illegal in the bus?
The law she does not know, in a remote bus is not allowed to travel
In relation to the tragic accident of a bus from the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewart and travelers can drive and drive during the bus trip.
"If we want to keep the law strictly and formally, then the activity of a Stewart is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Mr. Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which took a two-hundred-year-old Stewartes about his life last week, was probably caused by the driver of the LKW, who crossed the road.
The young woman at this moment was in any accident near the driver, at the least safe in the car, although she had two more seats.
A bus can also have an accident at the moment, or a sharp brake, in which the Stewart Coffee or News.
A role also plays if the bus is equipped with seat belts.
If this is not foreseen in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The railway buses of Student Agency have no seats; the director of the company, Radim Jançura, confirmed against Aktualnö.cz.
"This has been discussed with the Ministry, and this has not initially been agreed with the movement of travellers.
This was taken back later, and we have reached a consensus that passengers should go to the toilets when they have their seating place," he shared his position.
The law doesn't know a Stewart
"There is no clear legal explanation for the role of a Stewart - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the concept of motorists; however, it does not define their rights and obligations," adds the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorní believes that the law covers these problems overnight.
"It comes to the fact that the bus in the product authorisation also has seats.
That's all," he stressed.
Buses are divided into urban bus, where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with lifts and a higher permitted speed and travel buses without parking with the highest permissible speed and seating conditions equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESSIP-Fachmann for Transport Safety Jaroslav Horín sees no basic problem in the movement of Stewarts on a bus.
"In the case of a liquid road, there are few risks, the situation is comparable to the service on the board of an aircraft.
Even here it's not safe when turbulence comes, and the Stewarts can stop the head."
"But at least a bus scribbles, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or on a street.
The safety of the Stewarts must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and he also believes that these problems will not be solved in the light of the law.
Jancăra is ready to perform the services
Student Agency offers Stewart's services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession to be risky after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the profession of Stewart is risky, I will strike him.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers at the entrance.
This would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, Asiana director Alexej Litvin is reasoning that Stewart's lack of a compass is the only reason for his lack of a compass. But his company is only a fraction of lines compared to a student agency.
"We have no Stewardssen, however, we have been opposed from the beginning.
sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he said not a year ago for Týden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
When a line bus hit Naples, a young Stewartess from the Pilsen region who had worked for the company for two years died.
The Slovenian LKW was probably unbelievable and had stopped the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to eliminate a sharp mannover, but collitised with the right advantage with the LKW.
That the two places were sold for the Stewarts, Jančura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to apologize for the LKW hazard.
The Agency is not expected to wait on the Court of Justice for compensation for the young woman's family, but it also expects financial damage from the debtor's side.
A change of law?
Not in view
A more detailed arrangement of the movement of Stewart on a bus board could bring about a legal arrangement in which a three-pound expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not subject to the agenda, rather than the point system, the maximum speed on the road and the use of telephones on the road," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewarts to be something that could seriously endanger the safety of passengers," says Hanzelka, where the control of bus safety is in the competence of the police and the labour defence authorities.
Düsseldorfer hope to rest in Frankfurt
In large words, there is no need for the staff of the house in the letter of the WestLB.
By bringing together the units of the Düsseldorf Geldinstitut with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" could be created, i.e. written on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable income in such a business.
And in any case, such a link of the decisive effort could be to further links in the banking sector.
This is the case when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the attached WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Agency, which the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia has recently made it clear that it is time to find a solution for the future.
From a well-known connection between the Deka-bank, the Sparkas customers are familiar with their investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking for some time - also on Frankfurter page.
Although deka-bank chief Franz Waas has been informed by the submission of the half-yearly accounts at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Land street with a country bank, i.e. the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is held every half of the banks and savings bonds, has commissioned the Board to hold discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, so it is called at the financial place, just beginning.
For the first time, the Deka Bank, which counts with its 3,000 employees to the main employers in Frankfurt, is not talking about consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as long as the Deka Bank could merge with the Rhineland Bank and Helaba.
However, nothing has been done from this threefold bond.
As soon as the plans became public, the German Government spoke against the participation of Helaba.
Neither did the two other houses find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there has always been reflections on a link between the Deka bank and the Landesbanks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Board of Directors, had spoken against plans for a meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to be the knowledge that a combination of the different houses of the public-law sector needs to be done.
After the country elections in Bayern, the first link between BayernLB and the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank could be traced back.
For Helaba this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure increases further mergers, you should go after and after the partner.
In the south, she would only be a Junior partner, although she has been far better able to survive the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A meeting with the West LB has again proposed a rule for the sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is 85 percent involved in the Helaba.
In any case, stay in the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the decisive question with which the business model is to guarantee the future capacity of the banks, was not answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
At the end, there could also be a collapse of the West LB, however, which is not in conflict.
This is also the case in the letter of the Board of Directors of the House, which, in any case, will seek a "total solution" for the house.
As the combination of individual units with the deca bank is allowed under a hat, it will still show.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his friend with it, and so be everything else, he says.
Behind them, at the fifth liter-pierfass of the Kaiser brand, there is a massive built-in Berthier and proves the approximately 200 Octoberfest travellers, who can produce deep tones of his neck.
Elena gives Luca a cup of tea, then a cup of tea.
They've come from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the porta Nuova train station starts at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "Destination Monaco, festa della Birra", expected arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for the Italians, traveling in a bus exclusively by Brazilians.
In a corner of the park, the South Americans are already singing along their tracks, they have already celebrated in the night.
And that's how Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long mantel with pelzimet powder and a glass with large silver balls, is one of the buses.
For five years they've been going to the October festival, three towers are alone in this year.
Tonight, on the way back at 22.30 p.m.
Nights would only mean unnecessary food, Marco says.
75 Euro costs the train, the welcome truck with Kaiser-Bier, using the BAI, health insurance and German travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And they already roll the bus into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, no beer.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the passengers will sleep.
Well, they're still gonna need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and Woodskirchen, where there are also other buses with Italian brands on the highway 8 shortly before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienvise in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final statement, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up the yellow caps.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in fractur, and the Internet address by Marcos Reisburo: "conoscersiviaggiodo.it".
Second, "If the doors go up to the beer house, it means run!" Marco calls back in the morning.
"Run!" run and occupy the places in the back of the cell.
"Not before, or else we block, and not all the silver coins on the same banks, share in the space!"
The measure, Marco breaks, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget your drinking money.
"The security people show us that we are good friends!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone."
Thirds: "Today night's point is halfway around here again!" Understand?
And it's already going to show.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as road markers to the trees, to the paintings and even to the selection site of a large Bayerian people's party.
You want to be armed for the return.
It's the second whiskey week known as "Italian weekend".
There are no exact data on numbers; the talk is of 50,000 people who walk across the Alps and fall into the bi-cells, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police will be strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, with Italian volunteers supporting the Bayerian Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics in which Italians (about 60 units) and Austrians (about 80) have the first place with about 200 medical supplies.
The court is particularly popular in Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Believers of the Hippo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasised by Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good it is that the politician used the word "relativ" and also implied that the German banking sector will not be affected by the crisis-affected developments.
Because it's already on the weekend.
Münchner's real estate finance mortgage (HRE) (HRE) in Dax received a billion-credit from a German bank consortium to withdraw from the turbulence on the markets.
Reuters said on Monday that credit aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The hypo Real Estate should only pay the part it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
The background is lost in the daughter of Depta.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has earned money, the State's finances have been very short-term - which is no longer possible because of the lack of market access.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve was reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate was slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the preceding year, the income from claims for claims and certain securities, as well as the resolution of repayments in the credit business of more than 70 per cent of EUR 5 million.
Only in the light of higher revenues from subsequent accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Defa group, as well as from the replacement of interest after the award order and from the business provision for group companies, the decrease in income was still moderated by around 16 per cent.
The former state financer had initially been exposed to commercial real estate credit after his privatisation in 1990 and then spent it in the Aareal Bank.
Because of the low value of classical state funding, the Defa had been strengthened in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
At the daughter's value, the hypo Real State must now make statements that have a "significant material effect" on the group's profit and loss calculation, i.e. it is quite uncertain.
The fact is, the dividends have been stranded.
In 2007 it was already shorter than two thirds.
The Hippo Real Estate has been a significant state and infrastructure funder since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the financing of the interbank market because it has no customer assets.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit issue under the banks was rescinded by the banks, as the banks maintained their liquidity.
The Hippo Real Estate annually needs some 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio funds to be refinanced.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the funding needs of the group with the credit have been covered over over a considerable period of time and the company has been deprived of "from the influence of the highly functional international monetary markets".
From other sources it is to hear that thanks to the money the refinancing has been secured by the end of 2009.
Mr Funke, President-in-Office of the HRE, said that the hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to claim the cash markets at a reasonable time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Authority (BaFin) have concluded that the market capacity of the Hippo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is expected for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even surprising that the financing must not be taken fully into account.
But the opposite is also not to be ruled out.
After the late Sunday afternoon afternoon, the bank was still in line with the insolvency, and at least the temporary rescue could not slow down the customers.
The share rate amounts to 75% to 3.30 euros.
However, the rate of the loan is very good.
When the previous debts are not moving, the courses of the next loan are more clearly reimbursed.
In particular, the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned and are obviously the extraterrestrial times of 2009.
In the form of a speculative investment option, given that the mortgage-real-state loans are due to the significant deterioration of the bank crisis and the institution itself, which, with the adoption of the Depfa, had only been taken into the house when the crisis was considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the notes banks, governments and less-favoured business banks are ready to support the system, they can be excluded from a time-limited payment of interest.
Or it's going to happen what no one else can hope for today - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports submitted by the State to the State, it is only a legitimate hope at the moment that it is likely to be safe.
This should, above all, prepare some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term lenders can always use a loss contract for future tax payments on short-term earnings years later.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to kick: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - she tells it from Japan in the new exchange log.
"The first Saturday in Japan.
I was upset.
I already had a bullet before school.
I live on the Tokyo border in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, I didn't have to run for luck.
The start of education does not appear to be as strictly determined at the Tachibana as we are at home in Lower Saxony.
The students walked in from eight hours until twenty-nine hours before a short discussion round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who likes to talk to people, nor before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no formal education yet, I took an old rock from my host mother, which included blue, blue bone fractures and black leather shoes.
So in this exercise, I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say all right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I call Sylvana, come from Germany and have been born in one week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all dressed, dressed and dressed and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital word rate of Japanese girls and means 'needy, sweet'.
Then I was soon burned at my place.
The girl beside me has grown quite wide, and she has found it an honor to have the exchange students sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong fell, I was really upset.
Everyone talked to each other and smiled and asked me questions in the bag - it's really hard to understand Japanese.
In the break, all of them packed out their Bentos.
My host mother had made me such a lunch box - that's something else than the expensive German break break.
I had a trip with herbs, small vegetables, salads and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly, I don't have any dirty shirts, which I'm here in Japan.
Things look remarkable and taste completely new.
It turns out everything's really nice.
Naja, until the salted flowers, maybe, brrrrrr!
The Bentos in Japanese schools are not just lunches.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which then makes it very artificial - in the hope of getting to know the boys better during the break.
That's what I read in my Manga Comics.
I've been wondering if I can see it here too.
'Why does Japan count?' asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
"Because I'm mad at you now."
Finally, I've been reading the most popular Mangas for years.
And in order to understand the comics and culture better, I also began to learn a little Japanese once again.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a reliable for tradition, seats and needs.
And you put a big value on it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't lost myself here yet, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
A rat or a creature escapes when threatened, does that mean that they also feel fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check whether they feel the same if they behave the same way we do?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGELL Online presents in a selected series answers to the question "What do you keep for the truth without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other awareness, without I or anyone else being able to prove this before, where we can no longer prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we use other species and cut down on matters of emotion or of consciousness, we belong to countries that do not agree with the hardware.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it dies, flutters, or falls.
People behave similarly, and why some scientists end up with a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animals.
For one thing, almost always associated with the human consciousness, the interface cortex is connected with the side-frontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in these aspects of our consciousness, which depends on the pre-frontal cortex, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic property must be in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may have created, would be very different from most of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine how awareness may appear in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, they are not yet measuring, because of the special hardware, using our own experience, they present great problems to us.
Most of my performances relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is yet another aspect of the consciousness that must be more easily accessible to science.
The awareness processes of animals could be examined without reference to their content, and that is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially for the example of visualization.
However, in this approach, following Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one prefers to focus on the core correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the pre-frontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What happens now to the feelings?
I lead them back to the fact that a emotional system like that is activated by fear in a brain that is conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain-localised reverse system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) takes place.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, the primarys and in particular the people.
Related to the linguistic nature, there are fine cuts of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorizate terms in order to write them in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, means that emotions from primitive activities in the cortex and breast-feeding regions are similar to Jaak Panksep, which is more focused on the brain.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it may be involved in overwhelming emotions.
Pure theoretically, I can't argue with him, but it's for no apparent reason.
Panksep argues what appears to rats and people like fear, probably also feels like in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk, even if it feels afraid?
In my eyes, only behaviour cannot prove any equal experience.
While the neurological comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brain waves, however, they do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove that to the people, how would you like to prove it in advice?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably quite different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional feelings of advice.
In any case, progress is being made at the nuclear level, if there is a lack of the same in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness at councils, nor do I feel that I do not know whether they exist.
It may be kept for a while, but I prefer to go ahead and run against a wall constantly.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Friday for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is no amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or construction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests are concerned later.
It is possible to reduce even the number of EM stations from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at the highest speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Sukkis.
"The UEFA will keep us in mind."
A further radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Federation PZPN is suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and was replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious risk that PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several initialists had been convicted only in the past season because of manipulation at the height of the force, and finally the League had to be moved short-term.
Ambassador Dennis Quaid is calling back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privacy - and now she cares about the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan and her fiancé Dennis Quaid as a Hebrew.
He smells - and he laughs back.
Later in the war of the ex-wife Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players are now playing a bad fight with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan had been interviewing the U.S. magazine Instyle for the first time last week for the reasons for the divorce scandals: "This was a long time surprise for me, and that was very painful."
The extent of the burden has been experienced only after the discharge.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - is told about the story of a hero.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an amazing husband was evident: "Unfortunately," said the 54-year-old "New York Daily News", that "Maybe the story of our relationship has been repeated and re-examined for the next time."
It would also be " prayful", that the 16-year-old son of Jack will again be "publicly reminded of the pain and changes that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has been remarried and has recently been father to twinlings.
And so it ends with the wall: "My life goes on anyway.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going the best."
Prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany flights were even 50 percent cheaper in a current study.
Flights and nights in hotels have become even cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data since the first half of 2008 and determined a significant increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices have increased in the hotel market for many years, the nights have already improved.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities still rise by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, the prices were 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend in Paris and Rome was the most evident, where 30 to 37 percent of travel had to be paid less than a year ago.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "abundant travel loss of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London have also been stronger from the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Koln or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices are rising by 26.3% even in Europe.
Also at the airport prices, the trend in the first quarter showed still above:
As a result of the kerosin distribution, visitors to the economic class had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007, lead-intensive long-range flights were even to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for tickets from the economy class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in the business and first class were much lower.
In Germany, prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the prices have even doubled.
On the one hand, the price gap is the result of the economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the airline market is broken.
On the other hand, there is an increased pressure on competition through the Open Ski Agreement, which liberalises aviation between the United States and Europe.
Significance of the situation would be the unprofessional strike at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered a competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV hit Gladbach 1:0
With a tower and simple method, the Hamburger SV will lead the table.
At the Borusia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functional elf.
Kristoffer Small increases the threshold for national players Marko Marin.
The gladbacher came into the game later and broke up with a hero on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went to him with confidence over the lips.
He obviously knew he was right.
"We need the second tower," said Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the Hamburger Arena.
A lot wasn't out in the catacombs, the half-hour break was over, and most of them were back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV's physiotherapy, enjoying a higher view than many of the effluent actors.
And that's how his prayers were found to be heard in responsible positions.
Cornelius Jol, assistant trainer, refused and gave in to the ladies' demands.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Chief Queen Martin Jol.
This command has been sounded similarly: Lord with a door two!
The application was cancelled.
"It wasn't good to see everything today," said Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to be more exciting.
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers have to thank the headball experience of young Petric (11); and the condition that very weak gladbachers could not beat the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol together.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
On Saturday's afternoon, the visitors had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the Arena and the flashboards on the video wall, showing their union as a class premium.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know what to do," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the table-to-speech is more for the incalculability of the League than for the domination of its HSV.
The men with their later commitment - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torso Petric, and the Jansens, who were removed from the FC Bayern, are still slow, but they are not able to shine.
"We need more Flair and more drivebulgs," demanded Jol.
After the vote,
The Wall Street's on the edge of fear.
First messages from the rescue package's schedulers let the Dow Jones break into 700 points at a time.
That was the biggest point loss in his history within a day.
Later, the Dow found something again.
By 20:30, the world's most important beer barometer with good five percent in the minimum at 10,579 numbers.
The technological hub Nasdaq had more than seven percent in the minimum at 1548 points.
The biggest losses were at this time in the Dow American Express, which were almost 14 per cent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 per cent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs Bank were almost ten percent higher.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, the funds should be provided for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage paper.
The sum should be paid, not on a strike, but gradually.
On the contrary, the State should receive shares options from financial corporations which could be settled in the course of the relevant course development in order to reduce the tax burden on the state.
Share rates in Europe and USA in the Baltic Sea
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and in the United States do not raise doubts.
The share course of the German Grand Bank Hippo Real Estate runs out and runs down the Dax.
The U.S. index Dow Jones loses despite the planned saving of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular short-term losses of the Hippo Real Estate and the Commercial Bank have caused the German share index (Dax) to sink deep into the minimum.
Münchner's real estate finance shares have been lost despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks at the time three quarters of its value, the commercial bank has increased by more than 20 per cent.
The Dax was clearly released under the psychologically important 6000 points mark and noted with a decrease of 3.7% at 5.839 points.
The stock markets went to the knees around the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were afraid that the $700 billion heavy rescue package of the US government could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back into being.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent at 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could follow the vote in the Senate on 1 October.
The other European crops could also only be directed: in London the FTSE index initially accounted for 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743,61 figures after winning.

The Private Bank Sal. Openheim has drawn 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist companies also announced that the shares of Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter influenced flight of space probes
Over the years, a mysterious phenomenon has taken place in research for Ratlessness: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by-Manover.
Experts feared that the general relativity theory Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Almost 18 years ago the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the space.
Because of fast-paced fires, it is now the coolest place.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the Swing-by-Anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flightman from space probes where they receive additional moisture in the gravity field of a heavenly body, about the earth.
As a result, the sins can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Council of Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe of Ulysses.
What researchers have been surprised for years, however, is that flying bodies do not behave as 100 percent as expected under the age-old gravity law.
Much more comes to irregularity at speeds.
The sins will be unexpected sooner or later.
Until then, the physicists could not explain this effect.
They killed him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts feared that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einstein, which describes the power of material through a cross-section of the space, could not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes that Einstein did not err, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomaly using the so-called dark matter that the astronomers have invented in the universe.
"Responsive to the anomaly could be dark matter which could also be near the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter the world researchers have known for about ten years.
It appears that it is a force of appeal which can be observed by other heavenly bodies.
It itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, and in particular no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the dark matter is still a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their exporter, the tourists who fled to Egypt should be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The exporters from the Sudan had requested several million euros of money.
Six hostages should be killed by a driver before release.
In South Egypt, five Germans have been expelled.
Resolution negotiations are already in progress.
Again and again, Germany became a visitor to kids.
Wellt Online describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV sender Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release following reports of Italian television transmitter Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other villages have been released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were at peace and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition should already be on the way to Cairo.
The reasons for the release of the hostages remained unclear: therefore, the exporters were prepared to complete the removal by an Egyptian security officer before the Sudanese army had killed six of the exporters.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a solution," said the officer.
It would have been "only gone to take the hostages into custody" as suddenly "this surprise" came.
The Sudanese soldiers had shot six of them on Sunday in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The sellers had asked Germany for a resolution of EUR six million; the money should be transferred from the German wife to one of the sellers.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German media officer who was afraid to release the hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
The report therefore seeks to release the female hostages by paying for the ransom.
The men should be held as long as the driver had a safe flight.
The German message in Cairo gave an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the Stiefvater "leaded to suicide"
The many years of abuse by her stepfather led to the fact that a woman had committed suicide was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithian, Cornwall, received a prison sentence of six years after he had experienced eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro found that he had regularly engaged his uncle Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a statement: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle was in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had kissed her and bound her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guest room.
Trerise and his wife were separated in the 1980s, and he went back to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
However, the Court finds that Mrs Randle, who worked a great part of her time respectfully for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse she was added twice a week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an independent surfer and driver, had been "emotional dot" since 2006 and had "give her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrence Randle, found her in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is accepted that she has moved around by touching herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of resignation, who concluded: "I tried to make them laugh and to bind their eyes."
"I didn't use it sexually.
I feel responsible for their death."
Justice Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely friendly fetisher and must have been excellent for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, their actions over the years on her daughter.
In addition, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The officials responsible for the loss of data are charged
The BBC has learned that the branch office, which had lost strictly trust in a train in June, will be accused of "public security law".
The man was ordered by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were submitted to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the weakest charge under the law and there is no reference to criminal purposes.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They had thought that this would be an internal part of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
An employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause covered by the safe storage of information.
The Royal Government recommends that the official be charged by the Metropolitan police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted included classified assessments on Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Residential construction companies see B & B costs in the eyes
British housing companies could cost more than $80 million in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided $14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's investment 2.6 million customers.
The benefits for this loan are paid by all companies receiving the money of employers, including 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing and Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it would be "inextricably" that companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's credit has been paid.
But the interest on the average will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept the payments.
The programme for compensation for financial services confirmed against the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is sad that those institutions that have acted carefully ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions which were far less transparent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay for the investments it would hold, and that the companies had to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on credit will be spent on 450 million dollars in 2009.
This means that companies have to make 81 million dollars for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is unfortunate that those institutions that have acted with caution during the real estate movement are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions which were far less transparent.
According to the BSA, no company has been broken since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The benefits that will fall in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will fall for a full year and this could be almost double.
Since construction companies are separate organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings.
Milk will be five pences per liter treasurer
The people in Jersey are faced with the need to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that the market price of his milk will be reduced by five pounds per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a consultation company's investigations have been conducted.
The retailers themselves should decide whether they want to extend the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the market price of Jersey Milch changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is being charged
A court in Bangladesh has referred a prosecution inquiry to former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her advocates said that the court refused to charge 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several violent accusations of corruption against them.
Scheich Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released this month against bail.
Scheich Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the next week, but her party, the Awami Bundnis, asked the military-supported transitional government to grant her unlimited freedom for the first time.
The correspondents say that although her husband was granted a residence permit to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release whether they can remain on the free foot if they return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers suggest that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The Supreme Court has rejected the appeal bid because it says that it does not have to receive a bail since it is already on a foreign visa to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Hq said.
We will report a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers suggest that they are required to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami-Bundnis-Party president on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-supported transitional government had taken over her power, but she was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Scheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia, all the charges against each other are false.
Warnings about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children are not affected by the violence associated with the Taliban, so the United Nations is not involved.
The United Nations has carried out an infective programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to one UN speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise that thousands of employees would not be arrested or prevented.
BskyB missing complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing ITV sender.
BskyB has decided to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that BskyB's share would distort competition and allow it to have a negative impact on the ITV senders.
BskyB acquired his share in 2006 by calling NTL, now in Virgin Media, successfully prevented the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB prepared doubts about the independence of the ITV, which the Competition Commission had moved to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication agency Ofcom spoke against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV should be an unreasonably and excessive measure, especially since BskyB had announced that his voting rights would be denied.
New investigation in the US U.S. State Warfare
The U.S. Secretary-General has commissioned a special mediator to deal with the closure of the nine U.S. state attorneys in 2006.
The event was a report by the Director-General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, lawmakers and former General Public Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fears that lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Specialist Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officials who heard the investigation have joined the investigators in order to prevent justice.
In his report, General Inspector Glenn Fine said that serious crimes, including criminal offences, have not been fully investigated or clarified.
The appointment of a specialist with the authority to force the witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine U.S. state officials from their respective agencies.
At this point, the Ministry argued that government officials would be fired because of poor labour performance.
However, it was later found that the dissembled state officials were not judged to be worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the statements politically motivated.
Some of these officials were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking members of the Republican Congress, while others had refused to investigate the proposals for democratic elections.
US U.S. state officials are commissioned to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The former head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, has been sentenced to a decision and has brought his office down to the end.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the report of the Inspector-General has criticised the role of Gonzales by taking the main responsibility for the discharges, showing its leadership role "exceeded" and "extraordinaryly interested" in the process.
Other officials, including former President Bush Karl Rove's chief adviser, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Dark must pass, Light's move
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic hymes "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold price next week in London during the dedication, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece to Meat Loafs Hita album from 1977.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for the award this year after it has arrived in four categories in the lower selection.
The chief editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that went through such materials as time and genres and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrument part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 in sales and reached a point 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs spent about nine years in the Charter and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been among the most serious health problems in recent years. One of these was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heart beats after he broke down on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel his concerts because of an acute head covering.
Later it was known that he had a kiss on his voiceband.
Dark streets in town, often forgotten and soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of main traffic routes, alone, side roads and other surrounding streets, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Even so, it is difficult to tell experienced taxi drivers and long-term locals where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This winch street is located in the East Village and runs from the first street to the North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a steamy gas than an active traffic route used.
There are no street paintings either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has recently built luxurious buildings on the first street.
It wants to replant Extra Place to create a clean way to the gardens and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other prosecutors belong to the long-term neighborhood, which says it has been fascinated by the short gas, simply because it is one of the remainder of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture of the Community this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have made a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the Committee prefers that the road remain in the city’s hands, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted in the coming month, namely Susan Stetzer, the district head of the Community Council 3.
"Only a very small space remains in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," she said.
"It could offer how to repair and manage the road, what Avalon might accomplish, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small streets will be refurbished and seats that are meant for a coffee that the company wants to rent.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it did not want to own it unconditionally.
"The main purpose of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this falling gas and make it a public meeting," she said and added that the city had proposed the sale itself.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Building Protection Department, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his beautiful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has preserved some of its historical impressions.
Some believe that the street has received its name in 1802, as a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne, divided among his many children and a strong country was claimed by no one.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the Punkrock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is most known as the cover for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of cracks, lamps and parts of façade, posters, leaves and seals.
Some residents, including the blogger who wrote about the Gentifization of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public piece should continue to remain public as it is.
Others have accepted Extra Place as a rare property – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be allowed to rest.
Jeremiah Moss, who holds the blog called "Jeremiah's missing New York" (subscribed with "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Dead City"), published part of the city's story about Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small pocket gas that is even more dark and is marked by frozen metal tubes of storage halls, closed windows and raindrops during flying weeks."
With few exceptions, the road has looked just so short on an evening.
One rate ran through the back of the street, not far from the door leading to the CBGB, where today there is a theoretical clothing business.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty bottle of beer was on the ground not far from a fresh bunch of newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but they suggested that the street could be rolled up something.
Fields, he added that, in his view, some people underestimate the travel of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, cold and yellow.
The debate on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for secondary education.
Lance T. Izumi, director of scientific staff in California Studies and Director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-founder of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Spanish voters is a complex task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obama's election campaign says that "the probability of successful completion of school in Afro-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students" - which agrees.
In order to close this performance gap, Obama’s education plan recommends, among others, a two-language transition phase in training for those who learn English only.
However, the question to Obama is whether his use of bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in other languages as an English, is challenging his interest in reducing the distance in the schools.
For example, "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, 100 percent of the fourth-class students were tested at a good level in Mathe.
Also surprising were 93 percent of the children in the fourth year of school in English.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods, such as those preferred by Obama.
The School Sixth Street focuses on verification and practice, constant control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach followed by training in an English-language environment. That is exactly the point to take note of Obama, so schoolmate Linda Michaels.
This approach puts value on the almost exclusive use of English in vocational training.
Ms. Michaels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have had a remarkable success with a student who had come from Mexico just before. 12 months later you would be able to attend the classroom and not be able to recognize him again.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The services of the school would facilitate the response to this issue, but the political positions within its own party (national education associations support the idea of bilingual training) and its consistent support for bilingual training make it uncertain about Obama's response.
While acknowledging the point that immigrants should learn English, he soon tried to triviate the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should make sure that your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take into account carefully the education models that work, rather than treat them and triviaise them.
As a result, the oil price falls again anxiety about the economy
The land price is on Monday because of the fears that even the US recovery plan for the financial markets could not be enough to sustain the economy.
The New York Stock Exchange oil business fell by 7 per cent in the morning session at $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday the price has been down by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been hit both by the financial turbulences on the Wall Street and also by powerful storm towers in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were already again concerned, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan, which should be the biggest in history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been over.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citi group purchased the banks of the Wachovia Corporation.
At the same time, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial companies.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the slow negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to vote on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Researchers from the German Bank have written to investors in a communication that the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the Good Markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts adjusted their expectations for oil consumption due to poor economic growth for the coming year and reduced their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
Humanity record set up by series in the second quarter
In his defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he spent more than anyone else in the Jets trip in the past six months.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an unproductive game into a triumphal procession.
"I haven't seen anything like this yet," said Ellis.
After a slamming game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which talks about the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Passes at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard Touchdown, it marked the perfect appointment one afternoon at their developing cooperation.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more Touchdowns, which once appeared as an outlaw and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I haven't been particularly strict," says Cole about the steps that went to Cole.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has been voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole caught, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took place.
Externally protected Darrelle Revis found a broken hole and turned it into a 32-yard showerdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then took care of a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the most insane.
The Cardinals had taken the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into 34 to 0 driver.
That was most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the train, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jet "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, because the jets allowed in third quarter 21 points to be obtained without a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A number of points have been achieved in a short time."
Absorbed bursts strike his world record
Haile's bursting from Ethiopia has shown again why some hold him for the best long run of all time after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to get the track of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, the burst of the bridge has improved its previous result from 2:04:26 in 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Bracelassie, 35, has set up his 26th world record in his diverse career, in which he has achieved at least one world record or one world record on each track from one mile to the Marathon.
In the last month, bronchitis has left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing that the air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he's registered for the battle in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at target - the braking rate has been achieved with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train drivers like Gebselasie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen for more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, he told the press that he had been fighting in his yard two weeks ago and that is why he could not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back tired.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All is perfect running.
I took the training back a week ago and had some more thoughts today, but at the end of everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivalen from East Africa - that he was excessively orchestrated, that many of the world's best Marathonstars were generally afraid of losing themselves too much to the race leaders as if it were a train race, and that there was a world record of the fight.
But this criticism does not harm the size of the bridge as long-range runner.
Along with four Kenyans on Sunday, the middle of the street was reached at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to demand the brakes after the timers left.
A little more than three miles before the finalish, Gibellelasie made his last effort to get rid of Kambai, who arrived as a second at 2:05:36, thus improving his best time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became the third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germany, has completed a significant year by showing the seventh result of all times with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a return damage. However, she has managed to win Berlin and improve her best time in her third Marathon for five minutes.
She planned her journey by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan passengers for the first time , but after 30 kilometers.
Ascale Tafa Magrasa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pillar and discipline in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expansions of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, slammed, and giant routes, is a quiet city in which the pillar and the complications of the African American culture come to the fore.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home city of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Horston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three croquetts, 300 brown houses, 300 good winters, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today, it's a pickup station.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to think of the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city which it describes – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of the depression of the federal writing project – in many respects is a place of the very special species.
Eatonville is as independent, deaf and private as in the 1930s when Horston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what he's going through."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a town resident and community member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be heard."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of the triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate doubles as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a highlight of literature, and on the other, it is an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes prized - black culture of the rural South that has its roots in the American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and proud.
And so the thoughts about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all the Horstons call it here.
She introduced the world to her home city in books that came from hearts and written in words such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is located near route 77, a street that leads through the often forgotten center Florida, to the creation of black history and human drama.
Frequently, both in real life and in literature, Hurston readers led to the load of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then to private affairs.
"Out of the street to the left," she wrote, "the brown school is clearly surrounded by modern schools, with its furnished gardens and playgrounds, to care for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man from Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales drinks of any kind and is always suitable for hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus brought Eatonville with self-restriction, but also with analphabism, second marriage and sex.
I'm sure this wasn't a travel guide.
In fact, this wasn't a portrait that was valued by all.
"Then she described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters, denying the Horston by inviting the men to sing songs about her beauty, which were full of sexual performances.
She added, "Some people didn't get this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively excentrizer who returned regularly after being taken to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston was used in the city, she did this most without warning, smoking and dressed in a teaching Chevrolet, and wearing Hosen, in a city that even today forms something in her proud dress style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the residents were fascinated, although many respected them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "She never stayed too long," he added as he looked in his chair, on a terrace behind the Sabelia Sea, where all the probability was baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and broke her books.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was the first famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was placed in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big party, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they've understood their contribution to the world or their heritage," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston was published in 2003.
The winds came in the '80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to set up a five-minute highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-way main street of the community.
Orlando's predecessors had already pressed the highway 4 through the western city street.
The proposal was extended when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Force integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racism brought Hass into the Community.
"At this time a bunch of white boys often came and burned oranges and witnesses to the outside people," said Mr. Franklin.
"It even killed a woman.
They stole a watermeleon from the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, called for the Supreme Court's request to be integrated by calling his decision in the Brown case against the Schulrat as "an act of respect for my race".
People today say that although the suspension of racism in some respects was positive, they failed to keep the group together in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his youth.
"Black children were used to getting drunk - I remember it - they had their teachers in the morning and they had their teachers in the evening," said N. Y. N. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and director of the community's community for the protection of Eatonville Community.
This could be obtained as long as it could, she added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"Man didn't confuse his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I think there's a cultural club there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who were motivated by prejudices, as they did, with a positive sense of self-consciousness and words such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went on the road to Horston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the restoration of her peace.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway was a well-believed Horston biography to be found in the bookstores and made it again part of the American literary canon.
The street project came at a time when the most famous daughter in Eatonville was once again in the light of the public.
And this time, Horston's old neighbors saw her as a reindeer.
In 1988 the community began planning a Hurston Festival to show what could destroy the region with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening ceremony two years later, and every January many return to the festival.
A few years later, the area moved from its road plans.
"The plans of a five-pound street live in the city, speeded up the whole city with high speed, grew real civilisation," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd stressed something easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the street project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more trainees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and natives began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country's historical register in 1998.
A new unique library (of course called Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly created and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still as special in Florida: only 6 miles from the city center Orlandos can sometimes feel like a summer gas, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
Outside the search for Eatonville's history and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is required in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represented by black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a love for darkness, still fear that their lost community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Horston Festival was increased, a higher degree was also born at home.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Horston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, nor even more proud, creative and flexible, blind and confused like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who went back after college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or in the police, who said he could use some help.
And even the students, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old volunteers from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who pass just here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon again one Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York.
At first, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan disappeared from the newspaper and the violent TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debate.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-dressing offices with the glass-facing, bankiers and hedgefund administrators who have the Monopol in New York, they have the worst Horror Workday ever since the 1992 Börsensturz.
The suppliers are still discharging the metal wall along the city walls and transporting tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still hiding between apartments about how human packaged animals are loaded with about 50 T-shirts attached to one of the jockey-like pillars on their shoulders.
Officials still wait on food items on their breakfast bags on the citizens' stones, and it is still impossible to get a cheap taxi on a Sunday between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon because of all the world's transition.
Although I decided to put my duty on the quiet afternoon afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family files, about 20 people were already in the habit.
Not to pay back or pay the money to the bankers, but to the customer service switch where customers order delivery books, to ask tourists about the way to Macy's shopping house and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I later learned from Starr, my "personal bankers with license" were on the same ground as I was laughing.
In contrast to me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, to places where they landed, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Iceland.
They took money from so-called trifts (a little like a construction box), social banks and those local spruces that only have in a state branch and say they treat their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks were still and very happy.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, in competition management over and as a last Friday New Yorker went home, was Wachovia, another bank with savings of $440 billion, looking for a rescue buyer.
In the meantime before another intrusion, the office and loading agents who stood before me at their bars brought to a bank which is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases at Wall Street.
All normal New Yorkers have adapted in the last few weeks to the flow of finance.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribal market took so much confidence about Lehman Brothers, the bank that had passed away, and their ex-President Dick Full, who was appointed to be the president of the Board, as she would learn about a false colleague.
And Lynn, who has been a member of the 50-year-old uniformed Concierge of my residence block, has come from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in cash market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslim graffiti during a legal strike in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-hand judge of the Austrian Party of Freedom of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Party of Flemish, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in order to represent the organization "Citys Against Islam".
They carry pictures in the style of traffic signs on which a mask is drawn, lined with a red line.
The police accused the law-extremeists of the arrest at a Muslim Peace Court in Austria on the same weekend at the extreme right party of the country's Parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday morning, more than 90 mourners were injured at the private hall in Traun by Linz in a, according to the police, organized action.
The poets challenged Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the robbers, but criminal officials held this to an attempt to break the motive of the extremists who had been sent by the Hass to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is somehow related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said they were "suddenly shocked" about the news of the massacre, which took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan to the end.
At the same time, there is a round of research of conscience in Austria after the country has fallen into the narrow parliamentary elections on the right.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which were both far-right-minded parties with nearly 30 % of the votes, joined in their election struggle for a strict anti-citizen law and some of their votes were criticised by opponents as foreign enemies.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, joined in a ban on headphones and burkas and even made his commitment to food, which is generally linked to Islam.
At his last award in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of Moscow and Minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuing Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
Questionnaires and analyses carried out immediately after the election and the fact that the extreme rights of the country's most powerful political block are indicated that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barriers for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was rightly ordered to travel to France and Spain.
Mr Gliter pointed out a six-month spree after informing the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent were given the last Thursday to stop a foreign travel ban after they presented evidence to the judges of Gliter's sentence for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing of the Ashford court in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning Lawyer.
In a speech from the Court of Justice, "On Thursday, 25 September, the police called on the Court of Justice Ashford to prevent foreign travel from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register of sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a 5-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or possible shelter in the country.
A spokesman from Kents Police Unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control anyone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the main cause of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the conduct of registered sex offenders in the country, to minimize any risks that might pose for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew Glitter to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel good and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him by passport and he flew to Hong Kong after one.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and border officials said he would return to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August at Terminal 3 in Heathrow, David Corker went to the court of Uxbridge in West London, where Scotland Yard successfully requested permission to require him to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was pleased and pleased that Glitter was stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
'I received the master behind the stage to retain his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no noises, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flamencotens who ignore the concentration and depend on the interpretation to gain a relaxing look as a woman or as a man.
One-sided Artists
On the other hand, personality
I look back in private life, at these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find a typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they cannot attend the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Farmer presents a variety of thematics on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. On this page he was still little known for artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame codification at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of the photograph of Flamenco, "plays the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day," explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the observer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to express patience, sadness, joy, and thus move the audience.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on the stage.
Your personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would enable me to retain the characters of the largest flame comeers with the camera.
Farmer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera in 1997.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the material available, images were created that remind you of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, thereby leaving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
This is not only the dance, song or instrument play, but the personality of the artist, his character, who performs the public with his art.
The search for the essential, after a certain thing, which will be visible in the form of his hearing, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotomata next time.
Known personalities in Flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others who were photographed by almost seven artists.
The project has become an anthology of Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portrait led him to re-enact this idea two years ago and to realize it as a 'portrait of the veterans of sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer likes me very much to photograph the people to learn and put me in their condition of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think the portrait is the most difficult thing in photography.
You meet or shoot people, personalities you don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to make a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.'
The collection of the portraits of Flamencos from today's title `Flamenco-people' is displayed in the El Fotómata gallery, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the la Alameda de Hércules street. The exhibition can be viewed until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he just wrote is 'a tolerance'.
He does not know where the Roman operation takes place and why it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casmant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner added that the project with which he works is 'a tolerance' and 'all points out that he should not write the novel'.
“If I had been dreaming, I wouldn’t have done it, but I will do it and hope to end Rome at any time,” so he concluded his participation in the festival where ideas, ideas and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La Ciudad y los perros' was one of the greatest personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's prize and who gave the majority of the audience their voice, is compared with the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a publication before him, which noted that the Peruvian, who possessed a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given sufficient time to carry out everything else: as his profession was created for literature, the 'extraordinary adventure', the 'freed of reading' and the 'more than before'; as he wrote and 'Disciplin' to achieve 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, many corrections and transformations that he makes; like Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas's work was influenced by his profession, which is influenced by what he says.
The Spanish Roman writer concluded that there is 'no way and no way', where to measure and where to know whether books change lives, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a flying experience', said Vargas Llosa, who believes that it 'extremesities bring further benefits' and 'people', so I asked the writer 'search for ease' and 'the responsibility' for his profession.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Steergampfests fall partly out.
After the declared combatants found that the ground of the place was in bad shape, the fighter party, with which the party in Pozoblanco was to be closed, was transferred to the morning.
So the organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the star fight party.
So the party of the inconsistencies was set up, so two of the three parties could not be held.
On Saturday it calculated that because of the second premier match, it could not be celebrated.
The group of Matador was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who looked after and after the star struggle.
That's just a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who was three hours apart and triumphed, after which he had left the transition with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two ears and an ear of the star, which he had won more by galloping than by his battle art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without rest.
After he had done so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second battle with Buh-rufen.
In Álva two people wanted to leave the control of their car, which was loaded with 2,000 Kilo Haschisch.
Morning: five minutes ago ten.
Transport checks in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álva).
Two police officers called on the driver of the car to make an announcement, but they caught the flight.
It seemed like they didn't have to stop with the loading of more than two thousand kiloschisch.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, who was 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and fraud of official documents.
The incident occurred when the transport police officers of the Álava region had already completed their control of traffic on the N-1 and had passed through the area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out routine checks. The driver did not follow the instructions, increased the speed and tried to remove the control immediately.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped a few miles off the coast. At the moment, the driver stepped out of the car to cross a rural street in a forest area.
Finally, the police in the city of Ertzaintza took hold of one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers carried 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was ordered by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschischbunks, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and to the removal of the belt to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the sign was “doubled” so that it did not comply with the sign set out in the Kfz papers, therefore a arrest was carried out on grounds of falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue to investigate the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, could fly, but also determine the origin of the drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station, and will be held in the next hours.
Player Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown medicine.
Player Heather Locklear, known as Amanda's role in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown medicine.
A witness observed how she tried to drive out of her parking lot in Montecito, reported to the newspaper 'People' by the California Transport Police.
The witness told us in detail that Locklear `after 16:30 hours of gaspedal pressed and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forth from the parking lot, and when she left behind, she stuck a few times to her sunglasses'.
A little later, the witness, who at first didn't know the player, probably didn't realize that Locklear was standing on a nearby street and raised the car.
The witness was that person who informed the emergency service because they had “lived around Locklers.”
When the police officers arrived, they found the players sitting in their car, which was already standing on the street, blocking the traffic.
'They seemed to be out of direction', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to test.
According to a police speaker, the actor showed cooperative, excessive alcohol gain was excluded from the first time. "The first observations of the officials followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine," said the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an unknown substance which could not be determined, was arrested and brought to a local investigation camp at 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares is that the Andalustic Link of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the principal coordinator of the VL and the United Nations Affairs Committee, has today ensured that the regional association for education will be those who will meet the decision in the case of the former town contract for youth and sport of the Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who was returned last week after he was charged with making business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a major federist, and the Andalusian organization will be those who must take responsibility for it,' Llamazares pointed out how the party has to deal with it, which has so far been a city plot in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible examinations of the rules that Silva might have started: 'The VL always meant that such cases would receive maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has a stricter ethical code for all public actors.
`Sangre de Mayo': Heldenbuch von Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nationales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish revolt against the French. This is a remarkable film in the filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the drawings.
In this way, the cinematist tried to "show a number of personalities and social analysis" which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of artists.
“Sangre de Mayo” with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in Kinos and will later appear on the Telemedrid transmitter as a four-year ministry.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdós, ensures that thanks to this drawing work his `children' stream' went into effect. This has given him the opportunity to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to film a second-century festival in Madrid on 2 November. In particular, the history based on the basis of 'Episodios Nationales' took place.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was provided by the autonomous Community of Madrid for drilling, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time chance' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of 'refused Spain, which sought the false leaders for the fight because the people were brought back by the struggle for independence and under the reign of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Chinese regrets that with funding such as `Alatrist' or 'Los Fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Sangre de Mayo'), some scenes from the drawing book could not be processed with Horacio Valcárcel, who worked with the Garci almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he put himself on the stage with the actors you have to try to run before and for those who had not done castting, seemed to be 'democratic' and respectful, a part of the film director's profession consists of providing help in the theater and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you are working.
Many exhibitors he shoots in `Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (which he won) is the opinion and has ensured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo', nor 'Siete Messas de billar francês' and also not the selected movie `Los girasole ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`When you first believe that you work for the next comet, later you notice that it is only for the poems, and now you are satisfied if you have produced another film, Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Törtola Valencia
A flame-container from Seville honours a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Törtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florence Törtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusierin (Georgia Valencia Valencia Valencia), she was born in the fourth Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in Oriental dances.
She had a exciting life, she was one of the first combatants for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and set up for the removal of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, was fascinated by Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell her life, but to keep her breath,' said the flame container.
Your dance floor has helped me in Flamenco a lot.
'The dance of the Schmetterling' came to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I've been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area, she claims.
The insination involves two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who is still singing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilda Coral, who wanted to work exclusively with one of her former students.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very rare personality.
I'm happy because they agreed to work with me, and I feel very ashamed.'
The insination also consists of musical compositions and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Ariaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra Juárez, he takes over the role of the artist who was the divas, in whom he always loves.
In this work, we are also talking about a certain way of life of this woman, who has been known in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
“I wanted to call her back to mind, because I think she is one of the women who has a huge influence on a particular age and whose works today are no longer appreciated and therefore are less appreciated,” claims Bayón.
The presentation takes place today at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién Casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez was married in 1916, Zenobia offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities under the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Trinium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fifth anniversary of the release of the literary price and the death date of both.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the traveling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz' opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, New York is now being presented at the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién Casado' issued by Pedro Taberero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian poet known.
The US can pretend without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This set comes from the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensations reporter', and from the glorious presentation of the American cinema, which was released in the stage, from all America to Newman with his favorite presentation and followed.
Look at what it cost him to lend Oscar.
And when he came back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, that was a great blow to everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a big friend," said Robert Redford sadly, "my life and my country were the greatest troubles of his life."
No one was afraid to make himself ridiculous or superior.
As a 'father' of the cinemas and the Fatherland, he died at a tragic moment, overcome in fear of terrorists and before the collapse of the market, where the low self-esteem of the US is looking for reasons to remain forever.
If, in this hard time without discipline, only a few people can be amazed, you must not be supposed to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and experienced as a number of losses as well as gains: from the foundation that has written the fight against drugs and honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, to his own brand of domestic and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it was a lot of power to commit itself against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of wonder suggests that Hollywood should take it seriously without prejudice to nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar priest said that the work with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad young man who came from Australia, looked forward to calling Newman his greatest inspiration.
'And the greatest of all of us have left', George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who have tried to live the way Paul Newman lived today: high demands on the rule of law, a most responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media school.
But there's someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He got divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward 50 years later, who was faithful, although there were probably many opportunities to be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a home file?" he often laughed himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as the faithful couple, the loving father, the attentive Opas and the Philanthropic," they say.
For the Olympic Games the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the 2012 schedule, may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it doesn't agree!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything and everything that she had.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, it would not have been so clear.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nose starts with the ticket, which allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the noise on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they will only get you the ticket (the first one that exists only because of it) and (after an endless waiting period) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second one because I need the size XL)
Where do we really live?
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy much cheaper skyscrapers from less material?
So good, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Except that you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a waiting period of at least 15 minutes and also you have to leave the back bag.
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unclear in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road was on and we did not have to lie down before, even if it had once been achieved, but it would have been harder to get back.
In addition, it looked out for rain in this 40-minute waiting period, so it came to the test to organize a volleyball station and to overrun the house.
I believe that tomorrow some 500 people will have long-distance and some like me because of this chip I've got, don't even appear on time at the classification, I can already think that the exit was wrong.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect road, I would never like this road.
So I think we'll be dreaming of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptorist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference' organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of carrying out certain primary tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a road planner to move on the company's campus). The system takes note of what it hears during maintenance.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room who they are and even remember how they were dressed, can hear it and understand the key words of their maintenance.
It can also organize the audiences after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that talks with her, and that there is no company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon be heard.
Everything without the blue screenshot
End-printing
That's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week you talk very superficially about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many programs connected.
Steve Ballmer concluded that if the computer were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial furniture, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is only a fixation when you think that Microsoft in Windows versions added one or more functions and 'Extras'.
The change in direction is deserved
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system in general, just like the software.
When Google chrom appeared on the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many suggest that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an unforgettable part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his or her mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to execute the Firefox, the explorer or chrome and we spend more time on surf than in the environment of the 'window'.
For which half of the available applications are available?
Less Than
And Windows 7 must be compact, many partners must be like Vista.
Lighter, don't exceed, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can then eventually become the alternatives to Google.
In fact, they need it, no doubt, and I'll give you a little example of that.
The photo of this place was made in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the Refreshment Drinking Automat is a painting: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google for online research.
On the other hand, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear in the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the brand at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso has built it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blue Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built parish.
When we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the picture of a very strong man, with a thick bar that had raised a heavy weight in a wanderer circle.
Based on this, it is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, smooth and talented.
The English languages call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells us that the title ring is connected to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' surprises all due to his excellent tree wool, because of his different unisex cuts and is characterized by a small Belgian velvet (almost recognizeable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And given that the Belgian company does not focus solely on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweetshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmirire, Wooden Woods, T-shirts with strip, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable undergrowth.
Although it's very bad to use them as clothes.
You're very brave.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great dealings with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is dear, but full of joy of life.
In the meantime, the Sisters of Gruz take their new activity very seriously in the fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their call.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, leaving her residence and also making the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Barriers and shields, winners on the short tracks.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/Winter season, which my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango, and I have also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intensive work time, which is equally exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women dressed as they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actor and fashion designer, you're a very diverse woman, aren't you?
I believe yes, but finally, everything in one area has many communities.
Ever since I was a kid, I was excited about clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get back to my aunt's clothes and see her dress.
That was great to go to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in education and in the trials to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actor, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of the actor.
Finally, everything will be interconnected, it is so much respect for the cost designer and their professionality.
You've become 30 recently, you're not in a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than you, I feel better than 30 years.
I find that the woman will recover, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, and this has given me much inner joy.
So, do you think you're going to be a mother or not?
I've known for a long time that I'll be a mother because my body requires it and also I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let it go.
As for the candidate, I don't care.
I'll tell my child a great feeling of happiness and bring it out of love.
With regard to film art, you keep in mind the work you have participated in and have been driven in the last year.
That's exactly what I want them to do, and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, are very impatient and impatient and want to have everything at once, of course, which can't be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La ultima hora' and 'A busca de la tumba de Christ' should be introduced for the first time.
See how they like you.
A few days ago you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went to the driveway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a while, has just called me and invited me to London to join a parade for the well-being of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothing items from our collection for Mango were extended to collect money for Naomi NGO.
People don't know the name of a good heart.
I, like those they know, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to take a hand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, what is needed.
The car drivers that can be dropped because of the alcohol supply will need to install the 'alcolock'.
The Authority arranges that the driver, who had three official punishments for alcohol storage, installs in his car this system that prohibits him from starting the car in the affected condition. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not break in.
The initiative has already been announced in June in the last month and is now part of the report of the General Public Service. According to its comments, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resuscitate the driver, which is why a course for the conversion of the traffic behaviour has been reached.
In addition to public administration, the Ministry of Transport and the establishment of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Cars will participate, according to experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the car drivers who were shown more than once because of the driving under alcohol influence were again taxed.
The `alcolock' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it loses the alcohol content in the exhaust air and prevents autostart if the driver has made alcohol tests; or if an alcohol concentration is established which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than €1,000, the costs will be borne by the person responsible for the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices are already preventing up to 65% of regulatory damage in the first year following their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people can be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it has been punished.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be carried out in the usual way, and yet a reform of the principle that is necessary for the prosecution process is required.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some of the public transport vehicles and vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Lords will be voted in favour of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in schools. This has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality at 17:40 p.m., the timing of the program, along with the presidential flag of Benito Juárez de México DF, the Spanish aircraft, with the East and East of Asturias, landed in the airport.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that rose from the plane.
Direct to the Gangway: the Spanish messenger and other authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the mayor and princes of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Oh, very good, so you can't take people from here at the airport this time.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, yeah, very good.
But the Mexican press know exactly who the Prince and Princes of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport’s hangar and the red carpet, including military protection from 27 soldiers of the sea, who give glory to the sand.
The bear appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the bear, with long wind-damaged hair, with no usual 'peep-toes', may have been told that it is expected to be a winter in DF.
Before entering the hall, they laugh and are prepared for the photographers in which the official outcome awaits.
At the hotel's door, where she is delivered, one of the four largest in the city, waits for her a reporter from the Mexican TV that makes fun of her.
The best option is to surrender the mode
There was probably no suitable place in the world as Paris to present a premium of fashion, and there was probably no significantly superior fashion designers and Bonvivants as Valentino.
Mango presents the second issue of the fashion competition 'el Boton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion players.
This is awarded at a cash price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, has seen her drawings in the Mango branch window at Boulevard Housesmann Number 54 in Paris yesterday and has almost disappeared because of the emotional excitement.
Otherwise, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
There have been so many events that are related that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury's competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, it seems that the presidential table organized by Mango is spectacular.
Nati, with the hard heart broken by the pain, because his brother died shortly before he died. He had taken the entrance from the fashion house and had some beautiful things from ELAH that were stunning. He stood on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has Valentino at the dinner, accompanied by his honor.
Andy, the owner and lord of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was such a knight, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because Jacketts had hired the ladies.
Monica Cruz, had a house and a roof that she herself modeled, and she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a dance hall, so she was right up, reminded herself of the old times, caught a stick and made a sort of 'great play'.
Inés Sastre, did not close the space passage through the rooms of the palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to see the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always promotes a tremendous enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and gloves) in the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had previously prayed for a room without smoke.
The stars under the bright sky of Paris.
Oh la la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There's no 1000, but one more chance to forget Chatosic daily life.
And even if it's few, all are gathered in a book where it's how you get to rest. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The week is a punishment if he sounds at 7:00 in the morning, but the idea seems even worse to come back into the ethical rhythm, which requires the current life.
The office is the tension and computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one and no two methods to combat the daily creation and the problems of the working world.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to Yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book presents the entire list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 opportunities to relax' and thus comes the peace that brings the book into the books of the Verlag Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in the fields of work, such as working with the help of personal contacts, is thus denying such faith.
In addition, methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer raised to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to apply to sofa, to turn the brain off and focus on reading.
Talk in bed
Some kids talk at night
I mean, not those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you'll be shocked, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleepiness.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
These phenomena can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason for this revelation.
Often relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as alpines, panicful nights, Enuresis noctura (betsnas night), speech in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be at very high fever, stressful situations or overcompensation.
In any case, it's a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, fluttering or it may be a completely opposite (scream, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and consulted with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and this way.
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, so it will not be treated whether it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or stress).
What you can do is take a series of simple preventive measures:
Don't try to get the child to sleep.
So find a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and wild.
In the nerves of children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
It helps the child sleep quietly.
If the speech occurs in sleep once, try to keep it quiet.
Thinks it's harmless for the child and the next day it'll be impossible to remember what's happening.
Useful Tips
Don't wake it up.
That's useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it relaxs.
Think about it when it turns out to be a couple of phenomena, it is recommended to let yourself be consulted or to find out why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child will not be pressured to make an appointment and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it says, and why it says it, so they will be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it derives from.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that lasts just a few minutes.
Ill Houses ... at last
After a long duration, Illhausen on the game field is finally back at a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played many tours and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The time of this encounter, at which the attackers had the power to show you, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain of the purchaser, whose remote service was almost in front of the corner, Illehouses should easily dominate the game, and it came to a different first fund face with a remote service, then iron with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the footpit, which would require the reverse Denmark.
The opposite man stopped in the middle of the field and left only the lively rihai at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half of the period should be decisive with first two tours fought by Rihai and Temporal, and then with the first door for the Illehouses by Marais, who stood exactly right to accept a ball that was rejected in a first attempt by Godbold.
However, the inland toilet protection should not be able to enjoy its happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his men's cameras would have to continue to play.
However, Denmark was not aware of this and did not face major problems with an ilhaeous elf, which only a little went back to defend themselves, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball, after a great transition, was very close to the lattice.
Sarkozy finds growing fish
Before he can fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another diver in Britain.
In view of the decided attitude of the fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday to meet their representatives there.
Finally, we promise to receive him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that he will come with "concrete proposals".
At the same time, the President's visit will take place as a general meeting of the Committee on Crisis, founded by the Breton Fisheries, to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of over €1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée palast David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help his company become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of souls.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led to protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused the noise of almost ten kilometers long.
The cable port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-ële did not break.
Quiberon's half-cell was cut off with a spree.
Already on Monday, the souls of their determination are expressing their determination by burning them from early morning to tyres and pallets before the fireplaces of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Årmel canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing fleets do not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Cruisic in Loire-Atlantice will break up the blockade of the significant total raffinery in Donges at night.
The Boulogne-sur-Mars decided to wait for the midweek meeting in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the National Fisheries Committee's responsibilities, which do not support their movements.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not be followed at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Committee of Fisheries of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel are currently about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Miracles
The unforgettable performer from `Butt Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 and followed by Krebs in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, were excommunicated by the Chinese and involved actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer calculated this year with 215 aircraft delivered, despite the disturbing recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth largest air carrier, held its supply forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
As a result, the issue of the Financial Times is expected by the US International Group, which was funded by the US Monetary Authority, to pay more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was allocated to it.
AIG is ready to control the sale of a large part of its business, on its insurance of life at international level and its senior care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
The assets from which AIG would possibly be separated include its Aircrafting File International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the reverse transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in private equity, are further explained by the FT.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continued.
As soon as possible, AIG must make the sales to repay the loans over 85 billion that it has granted the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will get 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will lose in the same way.
Analysis Historical Paris of the sitting Historical morning meeting
The New York Barse reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had referred to Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historic case of the course: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the Sunday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is 777.68 points short of 10,365.45 points.
With regard to the point, the most powerful case in his history (684.81 points) was mentioned before 17 September 2001, the date of the expiry of the trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
As a result, the final take-off number is the Nasdag Index, mainly about 199.61 points, and the wide-spread Standard&Ports Index 500 to 8,81% (106.85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection of the Bank's rescue plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which should restore stability to the markets, the Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, was brought together.
By 228 votes against and 205, the Members rejected the funds he had prayed to the Secretary of Finance, Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here is a bad picture that represents the Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come 'too late'.
`If the project is actually condemned to fraud (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the US Central Bank, etc.) and other central banks to get the crisis in the grip, which would limit the credit conditions further," warned Brian Bethune, Head of Economics at Global Insight.
And Mrs Piegza stressed that the feeling of extreme urgency is even more appealing, "that every day, the ruin of a financial company" in the United States "takes itself with it."
Following the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the US authorities planned to purchase the banks of Wachovia by its competitor Citi group.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated rapidly and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets were 'not just an American but a global crisis', the FTN financial analyst added.
The market for basic supplies has grown strong.
The revenue from the state cash in ten years has decreased from 3,632% on Friday evening to 3,827% on Friday evening, and the revenue in 30 years to 4,161% on Thursday evening to 4,357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winning by points in the first TV show
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another follow-up was followed to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced the election of both Republicans and Democrats to their own victory in this television set, which should be followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although seemingly visible, was not 'brlant' enough to enable him to stop his return to the elections five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion issue on Saturday, the resulting Obama is in front of five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is the view that democracy makes the best figure.
In the still uninterrupted voters, so those on whom it is now arrived, Obama first took 39% as a winner from the polls, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them McCain saw as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his premise on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventeen-year-old McCain did not want to put his unambiguous experience in the field of foreign policy in the background, and to stress the 'nobility' of his opponents with regard to these issues, which constituted the centre of this first television series.
'Senitor Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I do not think that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president,' he also assured.
A point of attack that has been declared in the Republican electoral positions since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He went out briefly and accurately without leaving himself out of the picture.
He regained his ability to make good decisions and restore the image of the world of the United States.
'McCain has not yet understood, although Obama has already,' this week set up a democratic election position in which the Republican was supposed to have not taken into account the full extent of the crisis, which was imposed on the 'Americans from the street'.
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama complained yesterday about 20,000 people who had gathered for a election event in North Carolina in a streaming rain.
He did not even mention the words 'medium status' or 'employer'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage to the Americans, who hold it best to save the economy even on the edge of the ground.
'The coming week could represent a decisive turning point', assessed yesterday by influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative frame Emanuel, former member of the Clinton government, compares the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is part of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Once again, after stressing that it might even create a reduction in the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the changes in Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, has given him the highest priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates pay attention to the issues that have been raised on the financial market for over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which were adopted last night by the Congress and which are extremely unpopular with the people.
Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Young and oppositioned Sunday evening at the headquarters of the capital of the capital of Belarus, in order to assess the results of Parliament elections in advance.
A few hundred white roses gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the election site at Minsk's market to protest against the corrupt nature of Parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been reported, many young people have come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator shall return'.
Some say that they just haven't even chosen: 'What does it matter if they do it with my voice?' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to complete a democratic revolution.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading white-headed persons and certain assets, could be lifted if these choices were assessed by the observers as clean.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the election', said Juri Potemkin, Union press spokesman for democratic forces, a heterogeneous association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, Alexander Milinkiewich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is of importance to whom the votes are due, and we have that in place.
If members of the opposition join Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and have not been elected.
But its entry into Parliament may mean television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of trying to interfere with the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
Because if our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the elections, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the number of voting shares appears too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has indicated the way for any type of manipulation.
Have you noticed that a choice has been made? asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kosulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who meet the Government's proposals first.'
The silence of the night is falling again over the place of October.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are pleased to see their success.
Instructions - from blood, that's safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated her 10th anniversary, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because hema-Quebec became one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has won the confidence of the public, which was severely damaged by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the blood donors managed by the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated by the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation conducted by Justice Horace Krever in February 1994 aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and drawing up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Justice Krever was still late to issue his report, several provinces set up a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood reserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and both territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took over their work, nearly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and by working in this area over the next few years, we have recovered the public confidence', she says, before she proudly stressed that in early 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains that 'trust is something extremely sinful'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced numerous cases of the human nature of the river basin in Europe, with a new kind of creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has been leading since the founding of 1998.
And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we refer to one of the main policies of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which follows the use of exclusion measures, if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as it is clearly in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is caused by a degeneration of the brain, which is inevitably leading to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was received from people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease will be transmitted over the blood.
This incident has shown us that the principle of caution we used has a sense.
1999 appeared on the market a lot of more accurate techniques to detect HIV: the nuclear acid test (NST) that allows the donor to directly verify the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was in the case used.
The NST enables you to shorten the incubation time between the time during which the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be proven by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced over a period of less than one week.
So the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and that one could not recognize it, would be significantly reduced.
These improvements enabled the risk of transmission of AIDS to a blood transfusion to a considerable extent.
Today one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV infected blood.
In other words, it means that you had to distribute 12 million blood reserves before someone was infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec is distributed every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood reserves, it would last more than 24 years before a case occurred when HIV was transferred over a blood reserve.
I believe that today you can feel better if you get a blood transfusion or write to restore your health, the head of Hema-Quebec says.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to get the safety of our products.
You don't know what pathogens can get into the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus has been detected on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We must monitor uninterrupted," says Dr. Décary continued, before she stressed that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
`The need increases because the population is getting older.
Since cancer control treatments are aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The transformation of the population also affects the blood flow network, which includes only 3% of the population of Quebecs suitable for blood flow.'
Each healthy person who is 18 or older and meets the criteria of ownership can spend 56 days every year, so six times a year, blood will be spent.
On average, 14% of those who make their blood available will not be admitted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have moved to a country where malaria is spread will be excluded for one year from blood transfusions.
`With this 3% we are able to get an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
The lack of funds is very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, especially to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so intense today that you rarely find time to spend an hour in blood transfusions," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservation, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart attacks, eye cramps and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are tested, processed and frozen, before they are mixed with Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cable-blocking bank Quebecs.
In the Nabelschnur, previously considered biomedical waste, there is a large amount of blood in the stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrated the installation of our most thousand nabble blood samples, and we are planning to take more than a thousand more each year.
'We should probably start next year to make it available for transplantation,' explains Dr. Décary, which describes this program as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it', because hema-Quebec lack the means to provide this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in Half-final
Montreal's Impact last night, thanks to a 3-to-one victory (4 to 3 with all towers) against the Sonders from Seattle at the second and decisive game of the fourth final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall ratio was calculated, qualified for the semi-final round of the selection of the first league of the USSL.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive tower in the ninth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a door for both one and the other, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plantcentino landed the other encounters for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan on the way for the probes.
We remember that at the first game the front and back game had an impact on the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a prefecture Seattles had a 2-to-one retreading.
In the semi-final, the impact will be measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 row, but the whitecaps went into the semi-final round with an overall ratio of 5 to 4 yet.
It is true that the Whitecaps will have to be presented on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game are set today.
Short said - winner by Kovalev
Number 1-Trio of the Canadian crew is ready to take the season in attack.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Thomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn launched the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 side.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, took a tower, Plekanec delivered two proposals, and Kovalev turned a step into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the whole ship.
I'm not ready yet, the Russians warned.
I need another game to make me feel better.'
`He has been very specific in the first half of the year, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he likes the end of the game.
He's got a storm attack.'
Charest is on the north side
The Prime Minister does not conclude that the elections will be held before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest arrived yesterday after Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's Teilwail.
'The passage of our last big border in the north': this is the long-term goal Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the general assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebecs in Levis, where he followed the whole line.
During his speech, a sort of painting was designed behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of water-powered works, mountain works, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds like during the selection period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to conclude that he would abstain from the elections, even if he let his deadlines be very full.
The North Plan is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister has for Quebec, namely a 'new economic space' which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the speech of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern region at the 49th broadest grade - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited in explaining why the North 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment summaries or specific priorities for the coming projects.
At least some of the views on which more could be worked: mainly in water, in the forest, but especially in the mountain sector, is benefiting from the growth of the coastal countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
The collection of Mr Charests has the north 'Nickle, Zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds'.
This 'field twice as large as France' is close to us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our neighborhood, it's in us, he stressed how to show clearly that he's looking for a national foundation space to be made.
Quebec has been raised very much by his connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James book.
'It belongs to us, it is our future' he added after he had made a theoretical break to consider the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec area, closes a portion of Labrador with one, which Quebec has always asked for, the Prime Minister of the press said against it.
This is a traditional attitude which has been followed by all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is offered to take this position again on behalf of the Government, he explained.
In addition, 'with the climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible throughout the year due to ice melting.
Before this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to seize this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the Uranus and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebecs government would deal very closely with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly former Pakistani de Ungava) have already consulted some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, which took an important place in Julie Boulet (Transport and Grounds), took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not conclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will, in other words, be allowed to comply with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'to speak, to be regulated and environmentally sound', he promises.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in the office before us, we have thought about changing the challenges in new growth and development opportunities.
This was one of the topics of the week that was always repeated, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party's take-up by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions taken provides for the creation of Beauharnois's power plant in Adélard-Godbout-studam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which has achieved the slow revolution and the publicization of water electricity, to Bouurssa, who made the James book, our party always knew about the future," Jean Charest explained.
The press against him took on another conservative project, this time, and on the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Water Force Station Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its launch for 2012.
'This remains among us, but I am going to be there,' he assured his partners what he had done in the case of those riots.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no choice would be made in 2009, has in fact the opportunity to retain this heritage a choice which is possible for him by law.
He stressed, however, that his timetable was full, especially because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the Liberal Party received a platform from nationalist plans, especially from the 'the objectives of the Constitution' which were adopted without further approval: the PLQ requires in particular the recognition of the 'Speciality Quebecs' in the Constitution.
She would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canada's Round-up and Remote Communications and to have a Veto in relation to the decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were drawn up with scepsis.
The Head of the Québecois Party, Pauline Marois, has renewed the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
It said that the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, failed to apply this.
If they had done so, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs. Marois explained on the page of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
'But what we want is that this will not be just a big idea,' said Sébastien Proulx, a representative of Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - An Integral Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (which is ironic) at the Harper Cabinet, it was the last summer that allowed me to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'scande' for Canada.
This woman who has led an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration so much to cover with shame, says quite a lot about the people around the Prime Minister, as Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do it here with a government that has not returned home to the country where they have been arrested in Guantanamo concentration camp as the only one of the countries concerned.
A government that doesn't even take into account Omar Khadr was more young than the things that were supposed to happen to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, gives its word and allows a child soldier to live there under non-human conditions.
The only one who turns to a justice parody to appreciate the guilt of the accused.
We call to mind, in particular, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers' union are planning to take Omar Khadr home in order to achieve a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes to the people: It is little interested that a young adult will certainly be physically broken after so many years of the qualms.
We are still not aware of this, but we are experiencing a subtle violation of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which the harp always wears before itself, and that sounds so dissolutely out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there are no more morals: a Canadian citizen may be willing to trade, torture and block, entirely after the good of a government head who is only supported by the minority until today (may he belong entirely to the minority after October 14th)....
Many voters believe to find their hero at a party to preach the customs, law and order, but they do not see that this government has failed to tell what has caused the noise and the dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is in this mess, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwell Talk of Barrick Gold
In her issue of 17 September, Le Devor published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an evil logic that the world's largest gold-use company has sought to open a 'public transparent debate' for over six million against three authors and a small middle house.
If the judges agree that they are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of complaints of corruption, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely moved by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into ruin, who has time to represent one of their opposite views.
As the process goes, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada Book must be given considerable sums to prepare for their defence and fight against an army of lawyers who are paid out of nearly unskilled bags of gold.
The tactic of these unequal struggles is often to destroy the defenders in order to enforce an acceptable arrangement that makes the opposite and also discourages anyone who has time to take over the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they would have to present their views before the public opinion.
On the contrary, in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, going and giving, discussions are usually conducted in Canada by exchange of ideas and not by couples.
It would have been sufficient if the goldmines had revealed their books and documents and had opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent evidence that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in the public opinion and weighs the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, failed the opinions of this audience?
Obviously, this word includes only the widely paid lawyers in the world of the Vice-Presidents, not the Community of all Canadians, but a very well-founded view of the concept.
In a democracy, the right to speak to even the most common people is the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because they reject the brutal attitude of goldmines.
This public is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many feel as a nude complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them to no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely rejects the right to quote and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not belong to the rich companies of this world, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, they could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment in which we belong has been known for a long time to get debate and disagreement in the grip and resolve conflicts.
The irreconcilable complaint by Barrick Gold shows clearly that she has no interest in a transparent debate, contrary to what she does.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that restrict this type of unjust complaints.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Similarly, the Bush administration and the leading Congressarians, Republicans and Democrats came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic reform plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis that has been hit by Wall Street for months must be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main contents are: a better control of the members of the Board on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the return of the public funds used, new facilities to reduce the number of households occupied by the payment delay, and the right to monitor the holders paid to the prospective employees of the companies supported.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Justice Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations yesterday, announced a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-efficient,' said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
'It was all that happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street crisis,' the Democrats explained.
`This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,' said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, from fear of the effect that a new shadow had had on the vote of the investors.
The time that was agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who had been involved in the negotiations later proved to be more than a proponents of the agreement, but without delay, to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they must be treated in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama had some additional arrangements to agree, in particular those that would enable the owners to keep their houses and those that concern the holders of the leading employees of the State-saving companies.
If you ask the taxpayer to take exceptional measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, that is not something you could wish to do.
But these measures are necessary, he explained to the American television channels.
When asked if he would agree to the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
The instructions I have read show that this is a thing that we all must endure and that we can come forward with.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable, he said.
The $700 billion plan is directed towards, with the money of the taxpayer
It comes 14 months after a crisis, which was solved by the site of an real estate bottle, which initially led to the collapse of the risk mortgage credit (subprire) before it extended to other forms of wider loans (PCAA), and finally called for an infringement of financial power and the destruction of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican rapporteurs was that last week the first attempt was to break the agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain "gift" assets of societies should be guaranteed only by the government and not purchased, it is believed that the cash is coming out.
In order to round up the perspective for all at the Congress, it has also been added to provide a statement that, if the government should make losses within five years of this programme, it could raise new taxes in order to retain its capital.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to the next 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be accepted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
In contrast to his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that bring him in the case of dividends in the case of winnings, which can be sold again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to maintain the detention procedures for dwellings linked to the real estate credits covered by this plan and to establish additional deadlines for repayment and recovery payments paid to the leading employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber to vote on it today, and then the Senate in the middle of the week.
Despite all their efforts, it is still not sure that your plan will be made green light.
In fact, yesterday further votes were raised against this project, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'It is obvious that Washington does not understand us,' said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Commission, his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are involved in asking the taxpayer for cash.
The democratic rapporteur, Brad Sherman, the leader of a group at the Congress called the 'Caucus of the Scepticer', puts things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to put pressure on us, and to carefully review the way to be submitted,” he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have again shown that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partially government of the Fortis Bank Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The Government's commitment to Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank BNP Paribas announced that they would refuse to buy their competitor who is in great difficulty since they lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis through the risk of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty-first European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
'This is no lost money, explained yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos.
In contrast, we have a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now they announce uncertain times.'
During this time, the British government was on the other side of the Emermel Canal, just about to take over another bank that was under pressure from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would receive all ongoing loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank in Northern Rock, which the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the blue eyes for a long time was his trauma, no one would say, his weakness.
Did the American actor with the charming dress get rid of the Narristic mirror?
Yeah and no.
His tender feelings, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have also prevented him from being a power that really brings awe - inspiring monsters to the world.
But what a great enduring runner!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died on the consequences of lung cancer on his bank in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he felt and for which he had for a long time been a sort of rival on the Leinwand, more careful in his play, certainly even more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the breaking of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the vast faces of the American dream should be created.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality characteristics.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War, studied the beginning of 50th-year play art in Yale and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he succeeded in the theater, in television and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became one of Man's second 24-hour runners in 1979 and also a sex symbol, although he had lived with actor Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a preliminary relationship.
With him, the unknown faces of this mysterious, repressing, engaged and anti-glamorous star of the show business, whose advice will never be completely resolved.
A capable man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans replaced this week's cinematographer in Taumel, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
There the charming Cowboy from "But Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) reminiscent of the memory, and the young man, whose sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) returned to the cat on the hot flash, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will be called a much shorter memory (1990) which will wake up to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is broken up in his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, brutal, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Pressure) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought of for James Dean, was re-embraced after his death and made the Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathic Ganove in The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded with the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a vibrating and jubilant Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face is back in time, that's him.
He's still there.
In his life course, the eras are united.
The young man knows him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of an Eishockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a final role 2003 as the Patte of the Irish Mafia in Road to Loss of Sam Mendes, the circle was closed.
In contrast to several Chinese people who have returned early enough from the film environment, Newman should stay in the sattel for a long time and tell Hollywood, his assets, his ring and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without Humor, as a living challenge to the 'subplaying' when he assessed his all-expressive services.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who had only so many roles in the long run.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an external pager: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or doubters, with their perfect representation he reflected his excitement and reward.
As director, Newman filled the pages of his true self-evident sensitivity.
Rachel, from 1968 (after the Canadian novel by Margaret Laurence) and his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the capital, drew a fine female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through a overdose, devoted his 1984 film to Harry and Son, a work full of affection and sadness.
At the flood of honours that last night over Newman erss, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) exclaimed: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Greatness and joy of life were essential qualities of the deceased player.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a major defender of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's abortion.
We have often seen it with the foot in glass full of Vinaigret, in sauces, basins or other foods, and have kept it quite tasteless, even though we have at first found it funny.
However, the profits from his conversions flow into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of relying on his myth, Newman committed himself to the committee.
He left a letter with these words to his five daughters: "Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good stars.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to follow the life of such an intelligent and powerful American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the deepest and most common sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of Appendix & amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János began to be joined and its complications.
In particular, the defendants are accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as grave damage and fraud, and other criminal acts, including document fraud.
According to state authority, the funds released from the statements were used for their own purposes, while the benefits received were often covered by false calculations.
State funds and grants from the self-government - total HUF 65 million - are to be included in the Fiatal Baloldal's case, partly in private cases.
As indicated by the intelligence authorities, cash calculations have been submitted in relation to the claim money, and the Union is not to comply with its obligations.
According to the statement, most of the calculations should be faked.
The accounting blocks were purchased on the market by Józsefváros, which was placed in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the calculations are to be made was decided on the route north of the Platinum Sea, to which István Lados was sent by János Addiglag.
Lados pensions and restaurants should be completed in the course of this "acquisition tour".
He called for consumer accounts to be made available later to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the administration of Budapest on the basis of these proposals.
These accounts should be managed by István Lados and his colleagues, András Óri, most of whom should be responsible for the drafting of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Ection tour" was a beer resort.
As two of the additions and Co calculations issued in 2003 are to be taken, the gastronomy operation is to be conducted by the new group of Bizto Pont Egyesület.
But now there is the head of the company, such a large group would not have been able to fit into the local.
Another calculation, issued in summer 2002 on the Foundation of Jobb Jövőret, later known as the Együtt a Harmadik Évevezret, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomy, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed on account.
The imagination of the account boxes was apparently not set at all when it went around the Pigal Ltd., a gastronomy operation, in which the customer's records of work Jövőret and Hoppá according to the complainant authority did not even appear.
As President Győző Farkas of the hvg.hu told him, it was clear to him that it was a falsified document when he was submitted by the government authorities during a inquiry.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: apart from forms, the fact was also wrong that the operation should have accommodated a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that offer as many places as possible.
Also, if you have been on duty, the restaurant will no longer be in operation for a long time.
The intentional accounting officer has also refused to verify that the Budapest Travel Office, taken from them as a visitor, only offers travel abroad, and thus has provided Hungarian travel on the payment account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as reported in the investigation, they have also included multi-value taxes, although travel services related to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was totaled at four from the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation of Jobb Jövőrt, since the operation was calculated by only 15 per cent VAT instead of 25 per cent, except for mechanical calculations issued by the staff, the falsified documents were in writing.
A further error that had occurred to the "accounters" was that they had indicated in a case "war transport" as a result of performance, although not offered by the company specialized in investment advice, the government shared with them.
Further forms - false calculation format, false stamps - were to be appreciated that the calculations issued on Egyut a Harmadik Évevezredtét Alapitvány, as well as on XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesulet and Biztos Pont were classified as fakes.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camper Kunfehértó, whose business leaders were obliged to never issue the calculations.
Another "Failure" is the failure of HIB Kft. from Nyíregyhhaza: this company was in a solution in the time (2001), just as the group of the Fiatal Városét Egyesulet was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore advised that the calculations should not be made by himself.
Consistency is key
The other groups of accountants are persons who were thoroughly aware that they had to lay down fictitious calculations.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjj Socialistták, the Foundation Esély Budapest has issued accounts for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évevezredt, a total of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the appellant, the director of the Collab Kft. was commissioned by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to present the final accounts.
At the same time, the existing Biogate Kft. will also work together with Addendum and Co.: In 2003 the GmbH will provide the Jobs Foundation Jövőret Alapítvány, as well as the United Atlasz Egyesület and Vörössfenyő Egysülett with favorable estimates in the total value of HUF 5 million which are related to non-profits.
However, there was also little payment transport since the accounts were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the people in their documents had forgotten.
The third group of the accounting officer includes persons who are directly linked to the defendants.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postbot of the Ukrainian business leader Delta Trió Kft., who is located in Budapest, where there is no fuel and vehicle trade firm.
This company is expected to have issued several accounts over the period from October to December 2005 on the sale of ETV components in the total value of HUF about 18 million.
According to the intelligence authority, the cash investment Ltd from Kiskunhalas has been operating as buyer of these accounts in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company's business manager was a Romanian who should also be assigned the company documents by Ivan Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been conducting calculations on behalf of the GmbH to the Unit Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredté Alapítvány, and has cast their own value.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-investment Ltd. companies should be based on the express desire of Romanian Maureen to Ivan Kubatovs.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the fact that there were no contracts.
However, he was able to benefit from the company: On the request of his complex, the lawyer Zsolt Scent, who was responsible for the preparation of the company's original documents, he has issued accounts on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the addition, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáção.
In total, Kubatov will have 15 accounts in total of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies.
The government government considers that Kubatov could have paid 10% of the sum of the accounts as well as VAT.
Kubatov should even have missed the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fixed accounts - in this case the invoices were submitted to the applications of Bistos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáção und Søvöetätäätt gave its applications to the Joint Organisation of the Socialist Party, Täncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 Forints, however, these amounts have been used for purpose.
To translate this, they presented the TMA's five fictional calculations of the works team Ltd...
In addition, these accounts were secured in the Ministry of Education when examining the office of Árpád Kemecsei.
In the negotiations, a number of defendants are now counting on the way in which they have already been dealt with before the government.
It could be a feeling if the main prosecutor, János, agreed to a comprehensive statement.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already said several times to report everything, his attitude is still valid.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the recovery of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether an amendment is prepared to assume responsibility.
It is possible, however, that the addition now plays the "encouraged" after his attempts to slow down the arrest and house arrest had been put on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have suffered far greater damage to economic operators and have not benefited from them, on free foot, or at least under house arrest, the addition remains subject to this possibility.
The psychology of the surplus - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of enlargements, the buyers are reluctant to pay more and therefore to overestimate the error.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York are now able to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as an increase in eBay, do not want to be paid and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "play" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a player action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the samples were examined through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the fight, a complex under the brain, was measured at the loss of the auction, in which the opponents' surpluses played a vital role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase was allowed to be explained by avoiding a re-responsibility of the fight.
In order to subsidize their thesis, the economies in the research group have also conducted studies on the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should deal with a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the real value of the product and then made its applications.
In addition, another group was promised 15 dollars reward for the case that they were raised as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction that were also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on the one on the winning, while the others were on the loss.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group that played "against the loss" were willing to increase their membership than those in the control group or the "winner" group.
"These results are free from any previous economic theory.
This is because the behaviour observed at auctions has been based only on the joy of winning, or the risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved through the emerging neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third statement," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York's Economics.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor call?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is reported under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected countries is estimated at hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the term of collection for various viruses, infectious liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - liver transplantation and breast-feeding are common, but the rulers and the diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis virus spreads to two different types: hepatitis A and E by means of the contaminant (for example by contaminated foods or water), hepatitis B, C and D, and viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, shadow secret or storage).
Travellers will be recommended for vaccination against viruses A and B, however, against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show about two or three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malnourished, weak, abdominal pain and bronchitis.
Then the search begins on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing can last for up to two or three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and liver disease.
The main reason for this is that estimates are based on only every 10-year-old infected in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have severe consequences: it may lead to liver erythema and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their illness, as the emperor destroys the liver cells at home - in many cases the first symptoms occur after 20-30 years.
That is why timely warnings, such as regular controls, are inevitable.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug dependents, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already evident in routine laboratory testing, it is advisable to search the house for the first signs of unknown origin.
Legally recognized, the disease is treatable, the virus can be eradicated, preventing the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time organized by patients worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the awareness of these chronic liver disorders caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early recognition.
Do you believe in less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith as a kind of "skinicide" that should have made the death of Catholic martyrs easier.
Scientists at Oxford University have performed an interesting experiment: It has been examined, as far as belief in God affects the pain of man, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the more strange investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks while studying a painting of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Through a brain-scan technology, it was possible to prove that Catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project, with scientists also participating in philosophy and theology of various departments of the university.
When trying, the samples were connected to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: to one image of God's mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to another Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would raise a kind of religious tradition, while they chose Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other paintings and was perceived as boring.
The test personnel spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at this time they received 20 electric shocks at four stages, while either religious or other images should be viewed.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" at the time of God's mother, as if they were "careful" and they had experienced "peace and peace".
In view of the religious image, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had worked before the eyes of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thought that similar effects could also be attributed to other powerful images also to the atheists, but only the appropriate photo should be found.
"We have to find a picture that solves very positive emotions, like a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases," said Wright.
Following these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of believers.
Would the qualitative high-quality young woman Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're talking about.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in the pockets of men as well as on their heads in heaven: she knows where people have taken her vacation, what professionals they go to, and what they move.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business leaders.
In the direction of Skeptiker, which is charged by Orwellschen Horrorvisions, he can correct: these would just exceed the basics of the web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the original target of the company, in order to "order all information in this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years Google has been world-changing work just at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked after the status quo in five years he meant Schmidt: he wanted Google to be able to answer such questions as "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "What job is really suitable for me?", but his software is not yet able, because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be recorded during their Internet search, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search and return to it later so that the events can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are based on the so-called "recommendations" recommended by the system as a result of previous preferences.
However, the users ask what happens in the case of data abuse - "When you watch what I do" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company, the fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the struggle for freedom or the refusal to oppose the power that many Internet users have to give up.
However, it is a proven fact that the terms of the search are not only stored but also given to third parties in the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A paradigm for this was recently the case against Paedophilia in Brazil, where Google of the Brazilian Government transmitted information collected from the Community website called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophiles.
For personal rights, however, users who were concerned were still able to reveal in May when Google, together with the Civil Law Organization EFF, successfully appealed against the FBI before the court: then, in the future, Google can also be forced to disclose information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in relation to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users has been re-examined for two months in relation to their web and search lists.)
So Googles Image remains controversial: Those who issue their personal data at least because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services, the company is disappointed by the transfer of their personal data.
In fact, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and encourages computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason is that Google does not require its users, unlike Microsoft, an identification code, and makes its services available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and software package is far more attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of the software giants.
The Geeks, on the other hand, look at the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet – a relationship that has been withdrawn especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in the middle.
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing else than collaboration, it says that the users will deliberately leave track and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main issue remains the same, that is, publicly.
An average young person can manage his profile at the same time on several Community ports - from Facebook via Changa, they can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally join a follow-up system such as FriendsFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallerys that have been placed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples show: In view of the photos of the party last night, the friend will soon find out who she has had a bad friend, or the employee will be fired, because in his blog he only makes his manager feel honest about the conduct of the company - one is sure: The term "privatsphere" has been completely re-encomposed.
The one who leads an online life is what he offers himself - so in about this way you could form the basis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret or even go around the Google Monopol can do it - like with Scroogle, a tool that, although accesss Google's search engine, obviously, does not leave any traces behind.
Not a few people deliberately register not on community sites, so that they are not available, but also Google's online applications, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can interact with alternative versions that are not linked to a huge server park and therefore not generate the best profile by the user.
The public opinion waits strictly for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the services that have been implemented are not only Microsoft but also other software developers.
However, critical observers also found the alarming opponents: As soon as the group leader has completely rejected a protest from the employees after the charges of the company's children's garden have been doubled, the management, which was too costly for the employees to pay. However, all of this must be very mild to say that Google went to the corner even before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement, so that all regional events, or those that would fail to taste good, would be filtered out.
The internal arrangement of the group suggests that no new service will be required in the future, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could re-enforce a few powerfully: during some of my years, Google's books and magazinescan or archiving projects take place, while the company has to be replaced with the Supreme Court of Justice, so many others are encouraged by the "Health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile through findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best way possible, in which a person will be able to approach the data about Google in a surprising way.
Two young people help the second killer of Ózd in the control of the trace.
In the context of the double murder of Ózd, the police now have two young people who are suspected of helping with the destruction of the tracks, told the spokesman of the police commission Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people were stable, and they are now being called upon for help.
According to information from the news agency MTI, it is about two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid shall be subject to a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into investigation on Sunday.
The man is under intense suspicion of killing several people out of money.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a higher amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to compare his debts, so he had his fellow believers thrown into an area in Ozd, where he and his nine-year-old daughter were killed.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act with a long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murder with a weapon hidden in the tator.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the tattoos and the circumstances of their use.
Warning Burse puts shopping offer for Prague Burse
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have offered the Warnauer Burse for the hundreds of percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Burse.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warsaw Börse, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they had been excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their Börse.
The reason is that the warning bear finally belongs to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who, however, wants to exchange more than 60% of the paper in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily "E15", Poland's bids include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Börse.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Börse, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Börse and Germany Börse offer.
Peter Koblic, chief of Prague Börse, said last week that all interested parties would probably be the worst new owners, and he did not conclude that this could even lead to the conclusion of the Prague Börse in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Börse to 5-10 billion kronen.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of Prague Börse is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In its ongoing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves speak on Tuesday, September 11th.
The global financial disasters have caused us to thank the President of the United States, who said that "La Repubblica" - the President would never have been able to make his own party to the draft legislation after one that would bring about a deterioration in the situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-year-old investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11th".
Part of the press in Madrid is also located in Washington.
In the view of El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The U.S. financial system is growing ever more and will suffer worldwide.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the Congress, the risk is that Washington has no political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, and this is just a moment since one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, some say, "Day Indicators".
However, some States could still provide savings packages for their money-generating financial institutions, and the banks would save the money of the taxpayer before the bankruptcy.
However, a domino effect will be resolved and more banks will be involved, and then no further funding or other immediate measures will help.
For a long time, EU Member States had to jump over their shoulders and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weak financial institutions, the Viennan "The Standard". Moreover, the press continues to be more realistic that, after Americans, the European taxpayers must now take a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not been seriously affected by the crisis, which now falls like a tsunami over the old continents.
However, it would be advisable to consider whether it would be reasonable to accept the money of the taxpayer to avoid further damages immediately with several hundred billion euros.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacles sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan has presented an amazing project inspired by the Nissan engineers of hummels in the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the biochemical system controlled by autobots of type BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight each bee forms its own "privat area", which is very similar to our own "protection child", said Kazuhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology-PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The combined eyes of the bees, which can be seen in any direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees, play an important role.
In order to understand the function of the composite eye, researchers are taking into account the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree face field within 2 meters, calculates their deviations and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately leads to the collision-protecting process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds of break, and the autobot changes the course immediately, like the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this mannover is purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the autobot could not react fast enough to overcome the obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system needs to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a sword, in the case of the current cases, is still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees when they remove other bees.
And that has to take place in the middle of a second.
However, the deviation, in contrast to the bees, can not be made up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction of the reversibility of the tyres.
While the bees here are still open to attract other bees, the researchers were able to use only the driving movement, relative to speed and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer life span than the usual lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it is the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less the processing of data, and less the ability to store them.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It doesn't have to save it, or produce an intuitional, logical reaction through previous mannover, so that it takes only a handful of KB memory in demand.
There's no need for a gigabyte and megabyte memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collusion prevention technology, which will be in production in the next ten years following Nissan's assessment.
Another application could find the technology at the GPS satellite navigation by putting the driver aware of obstacles here and leading him to this goal.
A name for the child that will be born
Now there is a written version of the $700 billion heavy rescue package budget that will be used in several stages and aimed at the purchase of the bank's bad credit.
For the first time, half of the money should be spent.
At a meeting that took place after midnight at the end of the Eastern Coast, after a multi-day debate, the Congress's officers had concluded an agreement over the $700 billion heavy relief package, reported Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president in the US Chamber of Deputies, and thought that the agreement should only be made on paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson pointed out the outcome: the programme will be effective and it will be effective, but more must be done. According to Pelosi, it was not about the rescue of the Wall Street, but about the noise of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian market, so Washington Time Sunday 8 o'clock (medium time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not release a high flow on the bears.
On Monday, the House of Lords agrees on the draft legislation for the stabilization of the economy in 2008, and then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday afternoon with Pelosi, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
The programme, however, is based on the original Bush Administration recommendation that $700 billion should be issued once for the purchase of fake, credit-based securities.
In the first instalment, half of the 700 billion contracts are to be issued, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be applied for the purchase of credit carded, poor securities, and the President will decide over the next 100 billion dollars.
The programme shall be reviewed by a Commission itself, which shall also be the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion will depend on a further decision of the Congress.
In the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combination of tactics: it can buy simultaneously bad credit, mortgages, and mortgaged securities, or other "good" credits.
As officials of the ministry reported, the purchase can be carried out in both an auction and directly.
The law enables the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme guaranteeing the financial resources provided by the Ministry of Finance and to pay the companies in respect of the damages expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large purchase of funds, their insurance, or for the prevention of a system risk that will be eliminated by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to implement the law as soon as it has been signed, as Paulson said.
However, the heads of banks that have been hit by difficulties and now referred to as state aid can count on the government to cut off their skills called "Golden Handshake" in the Overseas Slang.
A reduction of the holders will only be given in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists each other.
The cut means in essence that if the ministry purchases an auction, then the Golden Handshake will be paid, because the issued bank chief will be transferred to the pension.
In the case of direct purchase of the fake credit, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers are not exceeded.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions are only related to new agreements, so that more people are involved in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts are regulated by law by managerial debt, the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains the rights to participate in participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate, as the economy and thus the saved bank improves.
The draft legislation stipulates that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how the taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were two sides of the sceptics that had raised their doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the money of the taxpayer, as is the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Captur said: The measures were taken by the same persons who are also responsible for the Wall Street collapsing.

No more visas in the United States since 2009?
King Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Aghurian visa agreement to take effect on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Your view is "depending on whether the electronic immigration relationship control system will be introduced in oversea at the right time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy is currently conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will overcome the "Miller Service Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conduct talks with the foreign political advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates of the major American parties, have announced their support for the $700 billion heavy savings package for banks on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who demand the return of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and representatives of the Government announced, after a statement made by Marathon on Sunday, that they had come to an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the creation of the enigmatic credit market, have become the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than the specific opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Following recent inquiries, Obama was able to build his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's High, which protected him from the presence of Vice-Presidentship candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was also murdered.
At a election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would soon adopt the law over $700 billion in heavy packages.
He stressed that the plan also included those passengers of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must act now, and although responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, the entire industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 observers.
He didn't fail to call McCain's business visions "obsolet".
In an interview given by the ABC sender, McCain stated: "We will all have to choose (...) but no alternative is specified".
The Republican senator said that the plan also proposed the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the tasks for Top Manager - something he had in his possession.
The CBS said Obama, McCain had no final role in the negotiations, although he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the representative of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Printing of German-speaking space
The right layer is intact, only the voters have been conscious of themselves within the warehouse - so "The mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haiti and Co are ready to manage to prevent a red-black coalition.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online release of the left German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic decline of the CSU in his article "Bayers Revolution betrays its fathers".
In the view of the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the tragic Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his mother.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bayern over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the end of the era is a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
Not surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not occur, but on Sunday something has gone to the end, but what has already been described just ten years ago: the inevitable hegemony of a state party.
For the first time since the fifteenth anniversary of the five-percent market, the CSU has been on the ground of 47.7 per cent in 1998.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, which is still in the so-called Stoiber era.
The modernization of the CSU in Germany has been well maintained by its own parents and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted it 40 years ago, but at the same time it had become very expensive. However, without any impact on the confidence of the CSU voters, the consequences of education, the flow of East and North Germans into the more prosperous Bayerns regions.
Modernization is always accompanied by a range of options, and this has political consequences.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the warehouse have become more critical and self-willed.
It is unfortunate that in the last few weeks, the classic bourgeois groups have just extended the largest distance to CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with Abitur as high school graduates.
Here the support of the CSU is low by 40 percent.

The conservative Wiener daily newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Participants in Coalition Questions" article on the chaos political situation in Austria after the news.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OVP prohibits the incorporation of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ shows itself openly in all directions for discussions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish a coalition.
The news is over, and now everything is moving around the coalition; in the debates in the public-law television, the parties have almost looked in their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very likely - in some federal countries and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question was whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Multer, the current head of the OVP as a vice president, had been opened by Faymann.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Schüssel-Molter course.
A repetition of this approach was not in question.
Mulder has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to intervene in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or is going to the coalition, be fully open now and these issues should be discussed within OVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself openly in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European summit has begun on equal opportunities, which will be headed by the EU Presidency of the Council of France.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Commissioner of the European People's Party, took note, in particular, of the education segregation, as this is one of the most serious violations that the Roma children face, and this would be the greatest obstacle to their functioning.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Employment Commissioner, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the EP officials of the Fidesz reported, Járóka pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the search for employment, Roma would suffer primarily from their low level of education from the labour market.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and because of poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach a higher education. "
Járóka further stressed that education is a fundamental human right that has a key role to play in the exercise of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that this relationship becomes known as a wider circle - so Rome and non-Romania.
As a Roma student starts the school earlier, his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased, and through income and consumption taxes they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education must be placed," said Lívia Járóka.
As the rapporteurs have explained, a joint, targeted and action-oriented action by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, which is essential for the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We have to break the devil's circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to Europe's future as full-time citizens," Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a single forum for the achievement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also at national level, within the meaning of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities'.
CSU: on time
At the end of October, the Duos Huber-Beckstein will decide on the fate of the fallen duos
Despite the election battalion, no heads still roll, at the top of the Bayerian CSU, the staff debate was rejected.
Mr Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace is to be granted.
On the fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice, the final October weekend will be decided on the extraordinary day.
However, the lot of stolen duo has already made it look like it doesn't want to wear on its own.
Therefore, they want to address the alleged group and the party base, which called for a day after the "babyeric Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of the individual consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career point, the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 per cent. However, only 43.4 per cent of the votes could be won a year after the Putsch against Stoiber.
The CSU has been "alleinregier" in Bayern for 46 years, the 18% of the German GDP.
While the conservatives remain the decisive force in which the Hungarian economy is important to the south, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be joined by the research team, which will lead to a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, in relation to the legalised "Free voters" polling.
An irony of the channel is the same as that of the list of "Free Elections" that Gabriel Pauli enters into the legislator whose anti-stoiber performances have first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to keep the target politicians out of nowhere.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its efforts on stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who had long since taken his feet from the background, will have an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU president named the "best day of his political career" on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few positive comments towards CDU - according to his view, the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the download as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at the national level in 2005, should not be put on the legs again with a joint force cap, the mark may not be re- chancellored after the federal elections in September 2009.
Markel, who has not made any difference from her frustration over the Fiasko, believes that the loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the corrupt CSU will not be easy to manage, and the crisis of the social democracies continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
At Sunday's elections, there was no spokesman for the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is in the welfare and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, however, the OECD condemns legal irregularities in counting the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
However, the legislation of the 10 million inhabitants of the state has come out with no opposition for decades. However, the opposition party gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) had hoped that Lukaschenko, who had already renewed its presidency's mandate for a fourth time in the elections, would "allow" the opposition in Parliament.
That is why the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is increasingly dependent on the rising prices of imports of gas from Russia, and even credit has been collected for the reduction of price increases, and the country has also agreed on the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline, the Russians leading by the country. Thus, the hope of the opposition was based on the prospects of the opposition, which Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-level politicians have been banned from entering the EU as an anti-democratic political system.
For a temporary delay, the OECD election assessment report, in which the emphasis on positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided that the vote was not taken.
However, the OECD's rapid report has already criticized the campaign on Monday - which is why opposition must not occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition did not remain present when voting.
Nevertheless, the opposition is unable to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free foot, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to recognize the independence of the newly established Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, which has been regarded as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps ahead and a step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Millinkewitsch to our page.
In view of the 2006 presidential elections' opposition candidates, it is desirable to continue, even though "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have had many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the process of selling stones, but I still see that more and more people support the change, even older ones," Millinkewisch said, reflecting that even the most-sustained scale of pensioners with the Lukaschenko regime, its only service is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's apology and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" of a peaceful building begins to be broken up," says Millinkewisch.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, stated the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe what they do, and not what they say." The lack of opposition would therefore be proof of the rise of the white voters.
Brunetta: "From now on it will be suspended before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are portable doors for officers' entrances and exits.
From now on, the action will be taken against those slammers who first pour out and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
">"Transportable doors would be a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta stressed once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi means "the choice of the portable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no opposition from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process has been supported by all, the cooperation has come from all sides."
So everything in all there is now no breakfast during work time; close with coffee or croissant.
In this regard, Brunettas says with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders."
At a meeting of the Administrative Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administration)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "in three months, workers' absences have decreased by 50%, which means that 60,000 people are more than one year's work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"the wage dynamics - such as the minister - have doubled in the last 8-10 years as large as the private sector and far beyond the rate of inflation".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have been gathered to counter the Brunetta Decree in the framework of the Codacons-supported profession.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of fewer absenteeisms at work - the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'fatal faulpelze' are growing.
In fact, thousands of right and valuable officials of the public service have come together to explain the illegal norms of the decree to the war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial imbalances for work-related illness; thus, the planned expansion of the compulsory home-care centre of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's renewals are adopted.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 cases of work occur, three people die and 27 lives remain incapacitated.
For the year 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto nationale contro gli infotruni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal labour accidents occurred at about 1200.
These figures include the severity of a phenomenon, which almost doubles as many deaths as are caused by murder.
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nationale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be held in all provinces of Italy on the 58th national day for victims of labour accidents in order to link the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of this day confirm how crucial the matter of prevention is at work," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nationale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of workplaces, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
"A forced "Basta" has risen above this; of course, in tragedy, which is measured by its size order, some vibrations in the media and participation of the public. However, daily reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not deny that "there is also a resource problem: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
It is particularly important to take the many initiatives for a direct awareness-raising in schools from young people who eat the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to withdraw from its social burden. We need to put a legislative standard in place and improve it.
On the other hand, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed that "the phenomenon of the deaths at work constitutes an urgent social emergency which enhances the conscience of all of us and compels all institutions to work on specific rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data on work accidents appear to be an easy improvement, but this does not mean that the number of deaths in work conditions is too high," said President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
"We believe that there is little to be done to prevent the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight it by various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are, in our opinion, necessary – such as Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to clarify the workers who are already in school.”
"An additional effort is needed - he adds - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility is asked by the employer's side of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke on "the progressive deterioration of the protection of workers for workers" and complained about "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to provide the employer with a guarantee of insurance so that the amount of the victim of a accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3-Player under charges: Danger of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer time range with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent injuries.
This is reported by the European Commission, which, in a report published in Brussels today, welcomes the opinion of Csseri (the Scientific Committee on the Current and Soonly-identified Health Risks) of the EU.
"From the report – it is said in a note – it will be clear that 5-10% of those who listen to music with portable music for at least five years at least every week for more than one hour a day, risking the permanent loss of their ears."
"I'm worried that so many young people, who usually place portable music and telephones on a high volume, do not know how to harm their audience without being aware of it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – thus called from the Eu – there is a clear risk that is too fast to deal with.
What really counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine existing control systems in order to be fully effective and to take action with the new technology."
In view of the widespread use of portable music devices, the independent scientific committee was responsible for young people in Brussels.
"Scientists - therefore the EU communication - confirm that you are rightly concerned and that the Commission will now examine the measures necessary to protect children and young people from harm that comes from portable music and similar devices."
At the moment, there is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that may result from excessive noise pollution.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions can be taken, such as the reduction of the volume and the length of noise wear.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu indicates that when users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) of music so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise pressure at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the total loss of the audience within five years.
This means 5-10% of users of such devices, which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Germano, the Committee on the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We begin today, in March, to be past, in June, balance will be taken.
This is the work of the 'Commission for the Future of the capital city of Rome', as set out in the Chapter. The Commission met this morning at the new sitting behind the Caracella themes.
In six months, President Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city and community council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," said Germano. "It will be proposed for a development plan for Rome, which remains the political responsibility of the City and the Community.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will re-examine itself, as such a project must have a certain point of time.
In June - so announced by the Mayor - we will introduce the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence because they have failed to agree on its commitment to the Germano say: "All the work which the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals depends on the Commission's work.
If she, as in France, gives quality results – and this will certainly be in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
The policy often deals with everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want a longer period of time to work with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The mayor of Rome places a lot of value on specifying "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a work: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roma citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will work the best heads of the capital".
According to Germano, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan, which is neither Hermetically nor static, to enable our city to achieve a quality source - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step in the future."
A future, such as that of the Mayor of Rome, who "is not only limited to the current municipal borders, but will be seen much further," not only as the role of Rome as a metropolitan and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement.
A well-known American politician, who is much more concerned about being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, delimited the economy of the United States and established relations with the imprisoned Islam (and still doing so as a private man)".
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more severe, just now where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very happy: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
However, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the election question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the questions; everyone says that Obama will be won with a great advantage.
In this case too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: first we will know who the real American patriot will be given his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until recently.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll decide for who we're gonna make our cross, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Something you've never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error did Bush start during his term of office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America's changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back to the house with a third in the back.
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The person who will take his place is in charge of a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its tracks with journalists: In the news, the cuts can be delayed. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they do not state that they are really concerned about the information about officials because of the general credibility.
They don't feel alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems come through the cuts in the newsroom, so the room in which the editors work to combine the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the great audience understands it, does not significantly corrupt it.
A clearer, but complicated pessimism is being fulfilled today by the American journalist.
Six of the 10 journalists and executive seniors of the press are of the opinion that journalism at national level is on the wrong path.
In the local area, it is even 65 % of the executives.
Printed by Dr. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine where the web goes.
The most important publishing groups are based on the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The economic pressure, which journalists fear, has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have agreed to join the new technology, hoping that "it will bring something good for journalism".
The largest rice is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for it.
56% of the chief editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
The business leaders who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
There are 30% in the journalists.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", etc.) is always a current theme in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a large nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, radio and TV and Internet operators, employers offer them a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors receive very often very high wages, however, the editor can only receive EUR 10000 per month to pay interest and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the case is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so much after the third, to reach a certain number of years of 15 vacations.
But the American journalists, as they themselves give themselves, will often "sick".
It's a question of the climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFFERRATA
The President of the second Trial Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudi, decided to reject the request of the real estate owner, who had asked him to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is reported against Coppola because of bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the dispute in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked him to allow the real estate owner to be transferred from the province to a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, he could have been given the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, when the Chamber of Commerce voted against the 700 billion dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the strict edition of the New York Times, which tells how the crisis is spreading in the run, which is increasingly moving in its old and moderate East Coast-soul, which has always benefited the state institutions and business community and those neo-conservatives, which are “those in Washington” and the financial world, which are hostilely opposed and, in the south and the centre of the electoral countries.
This part of the party thanks its rise to the voice I mentioned above.
This example is only a small part of the major changes that announce or even represent the current economic earthquakes: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West, and may also be affected by them.
In both countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-term fears of events, which are finally taken into account under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the discovery of the unsustainable renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banks and financial institutions, which have close ties to the country and at the same time manage an unhindered amount of private holdings that live in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to treat the families concerned, which is also a huge electoral mass.
So the crisis seems economically global, politically against it is almost national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen apart and lost its right to speak: the EU has given this clear evidence that because of its duplication in various national and international conflicts, there is no common way to find a way out.
Therefore, all of them are now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, etc. Distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become ever more serious, only the United States is in a position to survive without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: so two are not subject to excessive conditions – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organization or market can be recovered in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in line with the ever-increasing importance that is being attached to the economy with one of the most closely linked sectors: territoriality.
Paradoxer way is right now, if we were so convinced of it, as long as we were involved in a networked community, in a range of always differentiated technologies, of the material that we need to establish at once how our future will be, but more and more of the essential material things: water, land and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still linked to an external piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, those who have such a territory are in favour of someone else who lives in an area of land-based, waterless or oil-free.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short purchase.
Who's in the territory, who's in the government, who's in politics, that's what leadership says.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the necessity of leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on the existing guidelines, i.e. those of the economy that have failed as insufficient and full areas of shadow.
Finally, however, there is a deeper sense and even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, a lack of patience, an image of insensibility, a feeling of distance that is all about a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
This seems to be the conviction among large parts of the population that it is not just the actions of the social elite, but already their ideal world, their Way of Life, their culture, in the broadest sense of the word, that the majority of them stand as being foreign and superior.
Thus, the demand for leadership is subterranean, but powerful movement of the leading class and of the traditional political institutions. This is reflected in the unprecedented "revolts" of the voters and in the undisputed transformation of the collective mood of the past time: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bayer, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American parliaments against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy is a role here).
The impression is that the old elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, and therefore more understanding problems and less representative values about what is going on today in the lower social layers of the West, and further strengthened from the financial crisis and until overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be wrong to speak of a "rebellion of masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is not safe.
The superclusters that climb the walls
The forces of gravity are thanks to a fuel and can lift walls like superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, one of which is now almost achieved.
With a layer of only 2,5 square cm, the researchers have been able to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a narrow wall.
The STUDIO – has an American journal, has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the research team is a further development of the fuels already used, which are used as a special carbon structure called carbon nanocarbons.
"The principle of the Kleber can be represented as a series of stairs arranged by a Stapel Spaghetti", says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopes that give the animal a perfect halt.
The tests carried out with various materials such as Glass Teflon and paperboard have shown that the new garment is ten times stronger than the ability to hold the feet of the reptilians and at the same time "unproblemly remove from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dailyton University of Engineering Sciences.
"This material could be used as an accessible fuel," adds Liming Dai.
How about bringing Spiderman to walls? Perhaps already, however, researchers think more about a less fascinating use, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanorecks are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the area of space traffic.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
The other art of FORSCHUNG – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of clothing.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a carbon from microwaves that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface even from dust and thereby maintain a perfect burden.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin content, can cause severe health damage if they are taken together with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the intake by the body in an extreme way.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, again points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he re-adjusted the alarm: a glass apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines so that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of certain medicines such as antibiotics, antihistmatics, heart surgeons, angiolytics and neurological agents to toxic levels.
Medicines in GEFAHR – The same drug agency had warned doctors and patients two years before the risks of this mixture in a report, stressing what to drink in connection with medicines such as Diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT only GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, it also contains orange juice and apple juice substances that may be taken with medicines.
The list of active substances secreted by the seeds is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the University of Statale di Milano: "These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are so reluctant to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you read the package leaflet regularly and that if there are any misunderstandings, do not ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the expert of the Ansa Agency stressed.
Economic Nobel Prize in Paul Krugman
The economic Nobel Prize is for the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the possession of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokinesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the day of the Enron Summit, Krugman had claimed in a leading article of the New York Times that this second event had been more decisive for the history of the United States than the alarm.
A forecast, which did not receive a little Polish as a response and was held by the economy years later, is quite true today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom from the public field," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great value" but also a banker with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti Microsoft" package
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software has won as a free replacement for Microsoft Office a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, under free and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developer, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office will now present itself with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now spartan-designed initial menu, it is finally achieved on a basis of enhanced compatibility with Apples operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, thus providing the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, Microsoft Office 2007 was able to read its new format (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) through OpenOffice.
Interestingly, there are also some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e-mail sending. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files in a graphical editing module and also to save the original appearance image of the page.
This allows you to generate hybrid PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most powerful elements of applications: tables can now be processed by different users, preventing conflicts in the context of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a request will be given to each processor to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the Mirors since Friday.
Extra for Windows and Mac OS is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
In order to provide free access to the distribution of the programme in private households, it is also right in the area of the business where the Office could win the large volume: in the end, various public administration and schools have already been transferred to the Office.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opening up business views.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text editor; Calc, the table program that aims to destroy Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and last drawing, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand at the present time.
Also coal tested positive and thus the fourth doping fall
It opens up a new Dopingfall in the framework of the past Tour de France: it's about the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third-classed winner and winner of the tricot of the best climber.
The news published the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who was tested positive on Cera, the third generation's era. This was already met by the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood samples of coal belongs to those performed in the last few weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the opposition tests are to confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive eposest, and reported to the Associated Press also the Austrian officials.
The 26-year-old Austrians rose behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the trick of the best climber for themselves.
COVER SUBJECT: THE NEW YORK TIMES: IS IT POSSIBLE?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which will only be included with a return.
Does this make a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy, and from the case of young Burkina Faso, famous Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month after he had bought a package.
The case shows what time calls "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" are, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrantist feelings and the highest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the times are called for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just that.
The new legislation introduced by the Law against Immigration and to speed up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also identified as a sign of the climate change in Italy.
A movement that also undermines the pope and the president of the state: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State in combating racism."
Students Offers up to 900 Euro per room high rent prices
The market for housing for students does not know any crises.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the rental company, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very heavy training. All students lose their right to study as their families are not able to support them in this way" – so the responsibility of Sonia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand from the students is for a deformation of the market which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of damages: free contracts, missing registrations, free rent prices, unauthorized rents.
For the Sudan, the necessity is for extraordinary measures leading to a revision of taxes to lower rent prices.
In the context of the investigation, it is clear that in Milan a sleeping place is needed in the Brianza quarter of Milan, about 450 euros; a single room begins at 650 euros (at the bottom quarter) and ends with 800 euros in the fourth Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter of Vittoria.
In Florence, one bedroom costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the squares around the university, there are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the squares around the Union are approximately 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rentals in the squares around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who expand abroad can save money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar rooms.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bedroom, and for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, one bedroom costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting is more common to foreign European students, as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is about 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Looking back to the old cinema Paradise – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas are closed because of the preferred multiplex cinemas.
"A city without kinousel is a blind city like a face without eyes."
This picture of Director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with an effect what is currently happening in the great city centre of Italy, as well as in the provinces.
The process of demarcation of the kinos, which began with the birth of the great multisessional complex in the periphery, means long-term view of death for the onesaalkino in the centre. A process that not only seems unambiguous and irreversibly, but also carries the practices of a cultural crime.
Most historical places are full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've lost a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiseo", who introduced him 20 years ago the Oscar and the great price of Cannes. It's about the history of a city cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-lossed snowball.
The figures, which the Anec, the central business association provides, speak a major language: in the last five years, there have to be a total of 316 traditional cinemas to be closed; these ten paid most of the cinemas in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Nepal, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex kinos, because there are just these three regions where the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardy leads the list, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the acquisition of the already existing hall, because it closes a hall in the city, are not all his tribal customers, rather than the old multiplexkino in the periphery.
And here remains the missing state for the fund of the association outside the law: the debt charged by the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical moral position that the government does not observe the existing laws.
To get the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed."
It is interesting that the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect it by means of an agreement between the Community and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures provided for include tax benefits for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public with regard to transport: it is allowed to travel in the restricted areas of the centre and also to park cheaper parking charges.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also create new concepts.
Of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to fix something against the superpower of multiplex cells, as the audience is finally more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinemas has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the outstanding point that led me to build the "New cinema paradise" even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; if I go through the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndranheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the communities to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli.
The charges against mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for developments in Mafia business.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the oldest mediator between the Clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the Clan, was already sentenced to a fine of 10 million euros for the development of Mafia's criminal associations.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard is wrong," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"The Mafia group was thus made possible – so the judges – to enter the halls on an official basis and to adopt the policy of public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazione Louiero, does not deny that in his region "all other than one exception is to stop links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places in which the concentration of Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndarangheta: heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of this morning followed those of the past July, which was adopted by the police of the Clan Piromalli.
Since the end of the last April, Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but since 1991 – and at the same time because of appropriate links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians have been undercover by their community officials.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Media Law Association in May 2006.
He called scandal when the president ordered the resolution of the House.
He was interested in finding out everything on political strategic grounds in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, but the judges explained in connection with the court's order this morning that the Piromalli-Clan had even expected to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness has been shown to resist the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thereby making the measures of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan."
If the energy comes out of the waves, immediately the waves run on
It is a non-exhaustive source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet, and only now it seems to be understood by the world's major energy companies.
Wells, flows and seasons are the new renewable sources of energy on which all look now, and also search for occupiers, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movement of the sea has been taken into account and examined for 70 years; these studies have not gradually intensified since the first global crisis.
When the oil price was introduced in 1980, the idea of marine energy was ignored, but now the environmental organizations and the rising oil price are pushing new momentum in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is the same as the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the flows and seasons are still coming.
Giants at the attack.
The first company that is now on the marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more companies from the traditional energy sector that are based on the marine energy gain.
"Chevron explores these technologies" – thus the speaker of a company known as the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal – and looks forward to working with us."
This is in order to obtain an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project ahead of Alaska's coast.
This is a non-estimable sign, i.e. if you think that oil will continue to be promoted by the US in Alaska and President Bush has recently put the plans for new drills in progress.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verden Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known to the details, yet observers are speaking from a growing interest.
Even improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in progress, which is not the latest since the latest doubts about environmental protection sites have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a smaller size and do not seem to cause serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy at a large level, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment need to be produced.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bojen.
The shell of the waves, which the boje moves up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the cooler over coal and cylinders.
This leads to a turbine that keeps a generator running again.
The stream is sent to it via underwater guides to the coast.
To date, there are four planned facilities of this kind, which are still waiting for state approval. Some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power already produces energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using underground turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the seasons start the turbines that feed the generator through the current motion.
According to Verdant, there is already a long range of potential customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
Just the waves, then the weather.
A special interest is, according to the Institute for Energy Research, immediately deserves the potential that exists in the days.
While it is also an irregular phenomenon, the weather is more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of energy.
It is a matter of time-consuming energy that the Federal States, such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million have been planned for 2009.
