Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view on the city
An Irrean agency where young people are going to meet today.
A cluster cap, where it is now buried for the S-road tunnel.
Small farmers manage the only reason for farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.
It is nerve when maps are not available.
This is known by everyone who had to stand up once because the auto-navi instead of a walkway showed a green way.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the State government's geoportal Bayern, are all other than current - but that is why it is very surprising.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities in the area of distribution of the Munich Markur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flash spot that you don't recognize as such.
More detailed maps were drawn up for cities and communities, so-called Urposition Sheets.
These originated according to the word of the Bayerische Vermesungsungsverungsung between 1810 and 1864 and descended from the first Bayerns.
Your commander, Napoleon.
During the second coalition war with Austria, the French ruler occupied Bayern since the early 1800s.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops withdraw with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the neighbors today who created the idea of a floating Bayern map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to run the project, founded the Topographic Bureau - and thus the Bayerische Contesting Administration.
The Urposition Sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is available on the Bayer Country Library's website.
The comparison of the former/Today is the most impressive of the country's capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and is united.
An example of this is a messenger who is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sentling was appointed 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as Munich City Department.
Today is the message in the center of the city.
In 1856, the House of Ambassadors concentrated on the present-day plingans' street, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the resistance of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing is seen as a field - at first glance: In the Chinese zooms a smaller map with thousands of lines and numbers: hand-to-hand numbered flower items from the so-called "reception", from which the basic tax was drawn.
Small parcels are there today no more farmers - but small farmers of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large field of soil is drawn north of the sentry.
The Theresienwis, since 1810 the October festival, was actually a Wisse and no concrete wall in the 19th century.
On the other hand, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of today's Au-Hidhausen, you read not only the street name "at the gasteig" or from the addition "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeld street, you first stopped people with steam performances.
In 1858/59 the Munich Creis-Irenanstalt was created "On the Air Air" there.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Godden led the establishment of the Psychiatrist, who was brought into contact with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was making progress for his time and, for example, finished the polling of the so-called buggers.
In addition, he ordered the staff to use violence against the insatises," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Hayhaussen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the agency.
For 280 patients it was first located, and later it was expanded to 500 places.
At the same time, this capacity was no longer achieved - the reason for the construction of the railway station in Haar 1905.
There has been the Isyr-Amper-Klinikkum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and moved it into a youth home with training companies.
In the west lies the football field of the München East, eastern residential areas of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural loan to the original construction of the Irenanstalt, which was destroyed in the Second World War by bombings.
The Marienplace was described as "Maupt Square" in 1856, the Kaufinger Street called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought decisive changes to Munich's heart.
In December 1944, the Allied bombers attacked many villages in the city.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses, and a group hall from the Middle Ages were first located at the Marienhof, where the proceedings took place and on 5 April 2017 were held for the second S-road station.
The old Munich card can be compared to today's air picture - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Public law group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Union for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colorful people who travel to Missouri because of their discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to take extreme care, as a number of cases of pelagic, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the country and are noted here," the group said.
A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination charges, as well as the criminal authorities of the country, who aim irreparably at minorities, to force the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of citizens' rights to pass on to people.
They will be arrested for their skin color, combined or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group attended events such as racist attacks on black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during his journey through the state and was taken seriously by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Public Prosecutor of Missouri that shows that black car drivers in the state are treated 75% more often than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware of themselves and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring money or let relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri reported in 2015 100 Hassfractions, following the latest figures from the FBI's Hassfraction Report Programme, which included the State in the number of such injuries on the 16th floor of the country.
Travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company of housing or employment discrimination.
Before the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws, the local criminal authorities were obliged to arrest people because of immigration losses, which the ACLU considers to be contributing to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times interest groups have used the measures as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Extension project is an element
The Fisherbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU-Bunded Day Managers Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture in front of the site.
At the Schwendemann family's Court of Justice, representatives of the Fisherback CDU Orts Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided an overview of his business, in which he managed 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 milk cows and also many young animals and accommodates guests in five apartments.
The "black yellow milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cow, such as Swendemann.
The holiday guest table is exclusively regional.
Since he is also the president of BLHV of Fischerbach, he referred to the extension project as "elementary".
I can't bring up a profiting economy in such slums.
The Greenland area is concerned with much work, many need to be processed with the engine.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and topography," Swedemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed these without chemical protection and denger, even if he did not carry out a bio-use.
For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the extension project and is delighted with the leadership development."
For the costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to a complete removal of the area.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to carry on their business," the mayor stressed.
The farmers are often in crisis due to the support of the farmers.
In 2013, 25 parcels of 11 participants were included.
The opening area shall be 40 hectares, which may not be raised by at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
So the farmers left 12 610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers along the coast.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the zones," Swedishman explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter White also said: "This is the best food produced."
Baden-Württemberg's Landschaftslechtweg (LPR) will enable the State to promote further areas.
The target is the opening of the black wall.
The condition is the existence of a promotional cycle named by the LPR.
In addition, the growing area must not be economically viable (depending over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by pollution.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 pairs who want to build almost 16 kilometres of Zaun.
The area of opening corresponds to 35 hectares, which are estimated costs of more than EUR 112,000.
Isn't there anything more holy?
Now the white house of Trup takes the stand for freedom
The safest sign of a regime exchange is when they start to attack the stats.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully focused Sturz Saddam Husseins at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key psychologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic act in a current struggle with Jim Acosta from CNN on the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the status of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller didn't touch the status itself.
A host of boatowners and Liberty Imitators would have caught him if he had done it.
But he took into account their importance, and in particular the importance of which she was written when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to her base.
As Miller Acosta said: "I don't want to enter here on a whole story, but the stand of freedom is ... an American symbol of freedom that shines through the world.
The bed on which you relate to which you were later added and is not part of the original stand of freedom."
Miller is quite right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of the words of Lazarus, which are the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the nurses of the poor: "Your lips, your arms, / your heavy masses, which will then see themselves free to breathe, / the eventual loss of your rich coast."
There was never a time to see the "old waste" on our screens better.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural division: in fact, it is a conflict about the significance of America.
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words after their death on the ground - knew very well that they were pursuing a high-political course.
Sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female body of freedom in a classic way.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her neck the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she owns another name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist cup and a terrifying attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right flight for a long time.
The Great Rush Limbaugh, a species of John of the driver for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the stand of freedom is no longer an early neoconservative, which brings the American flame into the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to bring the burden of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The case is not to explain the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh's here on something.
The importance of the Statute is quite a question of the point of view.
The great fantastic act of Lazarus was to see them as they came from the creation, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people, looking for guidance and a chance to improve their lives.
Their status tells them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to admit.
Her lips should not make the way clear, but the hass, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team
Elidh Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two shots belong to the British team
The Executive Director of the United Kingdom's Leichtteltech, Neil Black, says that the 16-head Scottish contingent in the World Championship Card "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which started on Friday.
Black believes that "something special has been developed in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's lighting technology needs to learn something about it.
"We like it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Light Telephony: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaillers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be represented against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Elidh Doyle was chosen by the men to the team's captain.
"Eilid is pretty bad.
Her Captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The patience and the real feeling that Elid brought naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will be present at their fifth World Championships at the 400m-hounds, says it's "unbelievable" that 16 shots are in the British army.
Scotland has so far been the best number of athletes at the World Championships, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-run Muir is leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot that you should watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trial and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world champions when the only other shot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The human captain says that she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her people are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the media and at the finals.
"The particular thing to be a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was such a great honor, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It's just showing how far we've come.
And they're here as stable athletes, athletes who want to climb the bridge.
What do I say about the Captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a world empire.
So it's really important to put this home-aid support and benefit from that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Block Critics on Facebook: Do not cheat on a public office if you can't contract the membership of voters
Our country's father knew something from bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He was very critical, I'm sure.
But he didn't bring his critics to their knees.
For in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid we will be led as the sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it, more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff left the complaint free, and the online comment was filled with an opposite reaction with "No, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a vast democratic state, which is extremely popular.
He has the highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactive hit head.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means of connecting himself to his voters and debating his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
That is why the blockade of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially known as staff paid with public taxes dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chase defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments would be nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hair-filled people who push the pets online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only men of truth who speak to their leaders: a teacher, a businessman, and a priest, without a trolley.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not full of rage, but she asked for a hate crime.
"I commented respectfully that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comment area of the message "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take the same position on the same subject, they will be ignored by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the governor's staff referred to as "concentrated spam attack" would probably refer to others as "foreignness".
The Facebook era makes it easy to interrupt a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same, that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance articles and to burn or arrest demonstrators and bring them to their knees.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for using Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this question was last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, James C. Cacheris of the U.S.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington time, the time of the convenient port had a similar effect like the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers joined in his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolle.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Vallerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", write all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which were criticised by the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overextended his office, according to the historical documents collected from the George Washington Project's online paper.
But he didn't bring her to bed.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discourses are based on our nation.
And real leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be expected to be home for the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is holding the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordic, who led up to the end in the Archerfield Left in the past year, before losing Paul Eales, is connected to the new asylum place and serves as a tournament messenger on behalf of the Union Founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his dream with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he established this place.
He is a free conqueror of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The English Eales is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although he has won both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories come back from the last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action at home.
This event will be its first Scottish event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," Orr, the man from Helsinki.
"You want to do it well, but you also smell this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad it's gone so far."
With the trio on the field, the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance belong to the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking lot costs £5 per car with a car and £10 per car with two or more cars.
All discharges go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Reduced lung cancer by passive use
In the past two decades, fewer people have been killed due to passenger accidents in lung cancer.
To this end, scientists from the University Clinic of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are to be brought back to passive care every year," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he conducted his own study on this subject in 1994.
At the time, 400 long-distance cases were reported in Germany because of passenger accidents per year.
The new survey is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home lockes show themselves as very complex
The construction works in the Villelinger Street are in full range and "are at some point in time", according to the director of the building staff Fred Heinze.
In the area of household lockdown, the situation was more complicated than it was because it was hidden in the background, which was not noted in the plans.
The traffic that keeps the construction back on is a major problem for the construction call of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the car driver in front of red ampels and amphibians is already huge," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working with the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already very intense.
But fortunately, we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardini degei bought dinner, she doesn't use a hair.
She's using only a very rare top.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the heartless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually refers to a South Carthage - local as "nota" - directly in the Camin.
After a half hour, the frozen knoll will be removed and crushed with free, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the floor floor - she has no furniture - where she does her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with dry water from the nearby soup.
An egg in a cloudless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned a field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, work can be dangerous later: most villagers are unemployed, and many drinks are heavy, and there are soldiers here.
"There's no time to go back to the village after 17 hours," she says.
It is a rare view of daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was adopted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 seniors were to vote in favour of a public hearing in front of the employment camps.
An existing movement, which led to independence from the Dutch government, was quickly opposed by the Government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as cheap as it is. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive from the car in the morning.
There are no public means of transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bomb zones, and of well-bred roofs converted by rock into various yellow-brown tunnels.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here because journalists are weak and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored God by the name of Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," Degei says, pointing to her vivid, hand-made turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s worst province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst rates of infant mortality and literacy in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has built 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has a value of $78 billion worth of wood resources.
These richmen, however, are a source of heritage for the Papua, which ensures that the powerful Indonesian military maintains a magnificent presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars to a single officer between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000.
Papuanian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden genes and are treated promptly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
In the 1970s, mass killings in Papuas Tribeshochland were committed in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission for People's Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We are losing everything" means in a 2016 report of the Erzdiösse Brisbane, which contains the report on previous year's funerals, such as illegal settings and torture - rape and electro-related cases are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal downplay of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as each week happens," says Andreas Harrison, a Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been strengthened as Papuas resources bring a stream of residents from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the large-scale islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan war-warning canteens sell broth and Gado-Gado, a mixed mixture with earthnus sauce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and mice on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai-einheimist who went to work in Jayapura, the capital of the province.
"It cost the domestic Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the People's Republic, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roomman assured 27 of the total 29 areas of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua there has been little change, and today the natives feel involved.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi 2014, hoping that he will meet our expectations that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Paniai is only two months after Jokowi's arrival in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers carried on a motorcycle through darkness.
The frightened children told them they were supposed to turn on their screen savers.
One of the soldiers took a stand at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, such as the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drank were hunting and killing the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the group of children.
A 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set up in fire and the things cleared the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to request justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting clubs and led the Waita dance - running around and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago.
Some demonstrators began to beat stones on police and military posts.
When the vote was delayed, the soldiers were sent an order over an internal function: "If the masses are more than three times as opposed, they shoot them dead," it is in an official document of TIME, which was not released from local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto vette of Enarotali, saw the approaching danger and cried for peace and asked the people to return home.
No one was to listen to the vote.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left arm belt," he said TimE on his wall of wood.
Kayama still doesn't know who's fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was filled, many shots were burned," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was struck three times, so his cousin was the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "secure" their station because they would be attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people dare to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news of the killings arrived only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Jokowi, in Jayapura, held a long-lasting talk in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and found it difficult to see the historical missteps in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to commit these damages, but there are processes that must be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke in Jakarta with TIME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all will be regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who charged the UN for "Crime against humanity", who called for more than 1,000 victims of death in Ostimor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been reported, including the Paniai case.
Family members of the Paniai victims took such accusations against their faith.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there were no progress," says John.
"I'm smart."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was killed by the military after he took out four of the victims.
"After I had buried the body, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooters didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital, one person and 17 others were killed, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Doww, who was drunk when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Ordered villagers protested before the company's local office.
The police said that the village's inhabitants were throwing stones at officers who reacted to it by firing alarms.
But natives say that the mobile Brigade (Indian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killing a man.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid it would be given," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the victims were quickly brought in here, the TIME.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the removal of the officials involved and the removal of the police's mobile Brigadiers from the area.
Paniai was always an infamous for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the indigenous May, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green mountains of Papua.
Many end up with the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of Papua by opposing sporadic attacks and executions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders came from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and voluntarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some never get up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.
The small trip that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for domestics.
Brot is quite out of reach.
People here build everything they eat: especially notes and fruit and leaves.
The agricultural sector is the task of women who are able to manage four or five fields of South-Westphalia.
They maintain the majority of the income for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten items Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic differences between the domestic Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have reached a greater number since the opening of new airports to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region are usually going to better educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills necessary to manage its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Family Council.
Insulation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the provision of international media remain persistent.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with associated institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowis's campaign to raise the limits of reporting to promote transparency and development has not been implemented.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's unhindered eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Insufficient press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "separate and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir showed the group's priorities and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to translate the evidence for human rights cases."
People in the community want more foreign governments to know about this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on May 4, indigenous people brought their weaknesses and forced him to "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that it is probably not going to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the panic attacks," says Gobai, president of the Family Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the constant threat of a Soviet military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the beatings and beatings, Paniai-Schussopper's families brought out a last symbolic act of the Trots: the body of a victim was buried on a ground exactly against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was murdered," says Yacobus with a cut head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'torch' clouds of Dubai for the second time
On Friday in one of the world's highest dwellings in Dubai, a fire found its way through its library and forced hundreds of residents, from 337 meters high, to flee 79-square buildings.
It is the second brand, which in just two years through the building, which is sometimes called the Torch Tower (Fackle Tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood at the fire alarm and shouts of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who named him George Reuters.
Dubai civil protection authorities said that the units of firefighting against 4.00 p.m. (00.00 GMT) destroyed the fire and demolished the building.
The Government said they were working on providing accommodations for the victims.
The event can repeat questions about the safety of materials used in outer areas of buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after that fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from clothing, outer clothing for decoration or insulation came.
In Britain, the police said that they believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire which killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) was held at the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup.
At the meeting in Ho-chi-Minh City, it was proposed to play for this sport revolutionary, Davis-Cup only on two lines of gain, which was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Although often very long, but also because of this, highly valued five-sage classics remain in the tradition competition.
63.54% of the Member States agreed on the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was soon forgotten.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
It will continue to work to improve the competition.
It was not until the vote that a number of proposals had already been made before the proposal to issue the final at a neutral spot.
New since 2018 are only relatively small details: So the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host rights in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in matters of training sites etc. will be eased and the players will have to complete less official media terms before Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US passengers brings banned items into the aircraft, find a question out
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 per cent of the prohibited items at the control points of the US Transport Security Administration were frozen, including at least 6 per cent of those who owned the aircraft while wearing deliberately forbidden measuring or other items with dogs.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they had discovered late that they had suddenly been armed with weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charterer service, the Stratos Jet Charterers Inc. - also found that younger travelers had already broken the rules.
Of the respondents who claimed that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that was prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of the thousands were compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the X generation.
The most common substances that were deliberately transmitted to TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately taken prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said that it had asked visitors throughout the country to find out how many potentially explosives had been carried out by airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who were the first smugware - knowingly or unknowingly - carried by the safety of those who were the most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what fluids they can take or how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest number of objects taken by the TSA are prohibited fluids.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as smugware.
Flights are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is equal to: Ten thousand Tesla customers Cancel order
Elon Musk has a huge number of orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suggested that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their unconditional reservation.
In addition to the constant trimphacal figures for increased consumption and even more giant sections, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk first reported another, less-fashioned number: the distortions at the new mass market model 3.
In the past months, Musk has often bought more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.
Now there is music: Of the total 518.000 orders, 63.000 have already been returned.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only a matter of non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US $1,000 and in the UK $1,000) "Reservation payment" in full.
At the time, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were presented, and music was introduced in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of all orders could be a problem for about 12 percent of the time.
Its argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.
In the past year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 is to be a million, a million, a million.
The question of this is obvious.
According to Musk, bookings are currently available per day 1800.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today may first consider delivery in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its new brands, never in practice, without major interruptions with maximum discharge.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if it is too late, then the independence of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't prevent the unsatisfied customers from running into it.
EPA Chief Pruitt returns due to the slowdown of Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Chief of Environmental Protection, returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-Éra rules in order to reduce emissions of pollutants that are causing shock.
Prutt presented the change when his agency demonstrated the needs of the public environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a federal court.
This is a deadline for States on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for near-the-ground ozone.
In June, Prutt announced that he would postpone compliance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "inconsistencies in local decisions or to prevent economic growth".
Pruitt, appointed by President Donald Trump of Oklahoma, for a long time was a credible counter to stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has been passing over to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry are opposed to.
The sudden shift from Wednesday is the latest legal backlog for the jury's regulatory rollback agenda.
In the last month, a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a regulation of Obama's administration, which the oil and gas companies were obliged to monitor and reduce methanolcs.
In an opinion published in the medium-term, Prut suggested that its repeated use of ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of the timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and is expected to be charged by active groups and others, and to establish in agreement the time limit for implementation," said Prutt, who claimed the EPA more than a thousand times in its previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by means of a judicial procedure, and we take very seriously the deadlines.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us."
However, the EPA’s opinion was that Pruitt will at one time use his "authority to delay and all others legally available" to ensure that the rules "based on a solid policy and the best information available".
The Republicans at the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A legislative draft approved in the last month will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been adopted in the Senate.
The New York Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that had accused the EPA this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans affected directly by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York concluded in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Colombia.
Ground ozone is produced when harmful substances from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection celebrated a surprising change in income.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to make this reasonable step by the air protection officer we agree with," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological cross-section of the corrupt government, to offer ourselves to environmental pests and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 Years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the church's anniversary, the old Friedhof-Areal will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th, at 16.30 a.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the site is the historic St. Hilarius facility a favorite place to rent.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz series can move from this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the area have made friends and supporters of Tumlingen on their behalf.
Walter Martini points out: "It's a unique little village."
In the year 1267, St. Hillaryuskacelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Urkundenbook: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the Church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
In addition to the single Church of the Church of the Church of Tumling, the word of the Urgency stands on the Mount of Tumling, which was part of the Church or the right of patronage, and does not turn around.
So people lived there too.
According to the description of the town of Oberamtes Freudund, in 1858, it was next to the basement and Oberdorf, which are still known in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mount" of the third, the dominant settlement of the village.
Old maps from the time of the year 1600 undertook these historical events.
The patronage law was based on the early-time right of the Church of Owners.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and was able to destroy it too.
In this connection, the right to introduce a priest or to propose a new priest was conferred on the bishop.
There were three elders in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two most celebrated on Christmas 1673.
The newly arrived clock was then reduced for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II in 1942.
During the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648), the windows were closed and the clocks were stolen.
The roof was missing.
In 1796 French troops were stored near the Church.
They brought out the cancels and church chairs and used them as fuel.
The rest of the church had to be shaken in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Freedhof also served as the last resort for the deaths from hearings.
In 1823 the Peace Court was expanded and the Hillary Church was abolished.
Just let the church tower stand.
In the new night of 1834, a storm broke into the church tower and half broke down.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only today did the pre - Christian movement remain a witness to the 750 years of church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Water from the "Schaffigen Rentners" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, friends and promoters of Tumlingen's birthday, July 16, are taking the sixth serenade to St. Hilariuskalle on the old Friedhof.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium in Freudun city and with words contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mr. Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Placed from 15.30 p.m.
To the conclusion of the Serenade, a return will take place in front of the Peace Court.
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view of Wiesen to the forest," the organizers say the fantastic view.
The serenade is only located in dry weather.
The organizers hope that many supporters will receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumlings and hearing aids.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to provide home care, as Serenade-Organiser Walter Martini confirms.
One wants to verify the approval of windmills
"Boishheim remains" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore applied to the land.
The "Boishheim is awake" association has invited Landratet Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its permission for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boishheimer network.
You've been court-martial.
The Union argues that no wind power plants could have been allowed at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boishheimer Network, since at the time of the quarter there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible, while the concentration zone, however, results in an end to the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
These zones should prevent a "dissemination" of the landscape.
The city of Foursen, however, had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boishemer network a few days before a change in the land use plan - but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"With the lack of planning legal conditions, the decision to grant permission is still pending and therefore also to withdraw," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boishheim will remain".
Current status of things: The city has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boishemer network before the summer break; the government's approval is still outstanding.
"This means that the granting of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants is legally excluded".
The circle confirms the entry of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been entered by circle foursen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes the initiative to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the termination of the procedure.
In view of the ongoing proceedings in the Court of Justice, the circle on Thursday did not want to go beyond the argument of the "Boishheim" association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four 200 metres high windmills on an area at the Boishiemer Network.
Already last year, the company, where the city of Foursen is a medium-sized, had concluded contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large land.
With the establishment of the four wind power plants, the electricity demand is to be covered by approximately 11 400 households - that is about one fifth of the electricity demand for all foursene households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, Viersens Citytrat gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: A woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 333 between the Netherlands and the Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
A woman was killed.
Two other people were easily injured.
The country street remained closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her Pkw in the context of the accompanying train with her 53-year-old mother was accompanied by L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealer Plan Home Shops Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are going to discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The company and city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the shopping bomb in the city.
As the president of the company, Christian King, announced, the "Home Shops" weekend should make customers aware of what offers the city owns outside the ordinary supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, home companies should present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the business of the city should be invited to the "Mitnight Shops".
The action is not limited to the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation, advertisingpots are on the radio, an Internet video and printed beet that points to the action week, such as Christian King.
City administration and business companies cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
To that end, the company and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive City".
This includes new offers such as the first "Activ day" to the source festival as well as a dedicated Sunday, discussions with all operators and environments to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the discount on parking charges on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-closed or re-closed.
This includes Kurges and tourists.
But many natives would have lost the city when buying from the scene.
At the end, everyone had to contribute to living in the city - up to renters, businesses throughout the city and associations.
It was appropriate to overcome the lethargy that was partly widespread with a network, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, leader of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, said that he was taking part on the third "home-shops" day in the Bundeland, the first time five Thuring cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, St.
The day is to "furnish the value of local trade and make it more clear of the importance of our city's general welfare", says the newspaper.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her direct environment with its shopping behavior.
Two deaths and several injuries after an explosion at US schools
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
At a gas explosion in Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them seriously.
According to the firefight, another victim was in critical condition on Wednesday (the third time).
A man died when a part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A first missing man was later also saved.
It was about school staff who died.
As a result of the accident, the authorities refused to work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday, only a few people stood in the building of Minnehaha Academy.
Trump set up for safe transcripts of Mexican telephone calls under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
Translations of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trup called on a telephone with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the United States condemned him because he had publicly charged the wall. He then told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and it was difficult to pay Mexico for the project.
Transscripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and filled up an exciting exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the US refugees who had emigrated to Australia would be "fashioned", "meas" and "dum" and that the existence of the trade transmitted by the Obama government would make him look like a "deep" after he had proposed a ban on the movement of refugees into the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unacceptable call for the whole day."
Mores Ford Masker: Activists lead racist Lynchakt as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercuriy ran through a group of visitors in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and crashed into the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns went ahead to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a middle-aged man in a nald-drift trailer - took a long train to his cigarette and looked through the windscreen.
In the meantime, the insatises moved in fear.
"We want this n-- r Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screaming the silence when a young black man was beaten by the driver's seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But when a sledge is shot around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience will stand out very real hunters.
Since 2005, mayors have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to celebrate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It is really incredible that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the follow-up.
"It's a shame on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long citizen lawyer.
For him, the postulation serves as a dramatic call for trade and gives an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want punishment, we want the end, we want healing, we want revenge, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't get healing and relief until we get justice."
A court doctor puts a petition on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchens on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graveyards were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose foot for decades, citizens' lawmakers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom had a white base owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight down - apparently because of a woman.
Brooks said the funeral in the city had been that Esther had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was raising didn't come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Roy Harrison, a prominent white owner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murder," concluded a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the State and the local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the murder, which had destroyed evidence and betrayed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks forms even more prizers.
"It was an electoral mask," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, that will happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Her appearance is visible, exciting and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, which many want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and even harder to look, but Green said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lion, because then we are confronted with its cruelty in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 players – a dozen white and the rest of the black – started in a room and listened as Green started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is director of Greens Co.
He's been playing the role of the Chief Clanmate for years, but he said the role won't be easier.
"I feel sick because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story back in life because we don't want to go back to this time."
On the other side of the room, players Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, try their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, the horse-trapping and weighing him, saying he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get away from my property!"
Rascona fires the fire.
There's a break.
Then every soul will be cast out in an open space.
Green laughs at the sound.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think people knew when they said 'n--he'."
"But," said one of the other black players.
"You just have to meet the hard "R."
And that's where the energy moves in space, a feeling of the camera industry replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it scoring and with neural pressure.
No one really laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's noise, shock, and then noise.
A woman, dressed in mourning clothes, stands over the body of the actors and leads Billie Holidays to the sad lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice starts with every second word.
About a hundred meters below, a group of about four thousand spectators measure out of the eyes.
The audience is almost equal between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, are angels to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced almost eight hours of pressure in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the killers have remained an anecdotes, but now that you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder takes place, the air feels splendoury.
When the last notes of the song are heard, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children stare at their heads, register the falsified blood and the quiet bodies and fluids to each other.
"They're not really dead," a young boy smiled as he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene is grateful for the amount - and suddenly it is over.
The players throw the Lynchsey away and remove their trains.
Bradshaw smells Marbaugh, the man in the ring who played the clanmit.
Nick Rascona has two of his players and then falls in love with her arms, and the emotional burden of conduct finally falls on him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience will meet with the players for dinner.
On a table a white couple from Atlanta laughs about the follow-up with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski therefore struggled to find words that made him feel left out.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What's really going on with me, let me believe that Lynchen's still going on," she added, "Today it's just called a police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Court holds his table, eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The follow-up is inspiring in a certain way, because it describes the tears of what we have heard, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so, if we don't learn anything about it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is sentenced to repeat it."
"Good night" moved the Wagners in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, Director Frank Castorf places a bungalow-frivolous insination in front of giant, six-six-six-square cults.
The railway station (designed by Aleksandar Denic) is probably a famous street corner, as well as Mauerrest and Dunerbude in Berlin, a "plast and elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Tower.
Before this, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer will park in which the Rheantzechter is positioned as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stable olive groves remember Castorfs leitmotiv - money, power and shine - which is due to its "ring" insination.
The three rheints - songs by Stephanie Woodzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as already in the "Rheingold" wonderful.
Kess conducts Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), lowering a body in Hollywood-Manier and giving the Krawallo-Click.
Stephen Milling sings the lovely hagen that surrounds the Aura of a heavy boxer.
Brutal the scene when he suggests victory.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) also had to believe in it.
The audience thanks the assembly for its strong appeal.
Strongly celebrated is Foster, Milling, Vinke and Director Janowski, who smile and wash their hands to the Merkel route.
There is a great deal for the party orchestra, which first shows itself on the stage - in view of the great heat again in lighter leisure clothing.
The event of Frank Castorf and his regime were expected to be delayed.
If he had to have another valid pfeif concert in 2013, five years later, there was a big jubilee in which the united "Buh" race was held.
Captain Katharina Wagner may have been pleased with this.
"I notice that the audience has been in contact with the "Ring" in some way," she said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience has not only made one form of peace with Castorf, but it has also increased its understanding of its way of view.
I'm going to take a positive review.
Max quantity works as volunteer
They work in their holiday year in several places.
Where is it?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture pool, once a week I helped out here in Greven in the furniture bridges.
And I've been working at school all day long.
How are your experiences doing this?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old, so you're a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
Lots: I made Abitur.
And then a construction study, we say once, successfully cancelled.
I realized for myself that it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you were doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, there's a way to see how it's in place, maybe at the fireplace.
And that's what it was?
Amount: I've collected great impressions.
I'll start my study in the social class in winter.
I'm going to study twice, probably do social education in the youth master and study in Hamm at the university.
Is it not unusual to have several different rates of use during the voluntary service?
Amount: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it's always going to be where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from age to youth - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very different with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
What about the construction industry?
Quantity: Of course, this is not why statistics are not going to be counted.
You always have other people in your head who each one has a whole different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been expelled from the family - you must always get involved individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any contact charges?
Amount: I'm not the type for that.
It's a field that has a lot to do with it.
A lot of love, a lot of friendship.
There are even negative moments, but that's what life is like.
Pearson cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to relive the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it will build more than 3,000 jobs and cut their distributions by 72%, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which has been announced by Director General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, it has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan for another 300 million dollars (394 million US dollars) to re-live a business that was hit by the rapid step in digital learning.
The company, which had transferred its share to Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the business year had not changed since it had reached an increase of 1 per cent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed by suicide
A suicide victim has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of the Nato and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and a dolmetscher were injured, sharing a statement from the Nato.
Unconfirmed local reports have resulted in the death of three civilians in the village of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violent attack that Afghanistan has experienced this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday a suicide victim killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In an opinion of the Nato, it was said that the explosion on the Donnerstagbend was carried out when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "inpropriated explosive device carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the airport of Bagram in the U.S. military hospital.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Karabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly skiing district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a violent bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most lethal military attack on the country, since the US-led troops defeated the Taliban in 2001.
The violence undermines the pre-war security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump intends to increase the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks, suicides in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses the decision to delay the smog rule by complaints of
The U.S. Environmental Authority has decided to delay the regulation of Obama's government, to raise the obligation of the States to reduce smog emissions, which occurred one day after 15 states accused the Agency of taking action.
The EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to proceed with the so-called "Ozone Provisions 2015" and said that it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and react to our public partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Prutt announced the EPA's intention to measure ozone requirements in a part of the country's harmful emissions to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 democratic states, together with Colombia's district, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to restore a broad range of environmental platforms, which the former President Barack Obama has set up, as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, is to bring about economic growth.
However, efforts have solved the decline of democracies and natural protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The website of the EPA says that the mention of air containing the ozone "can reduce the lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as Asthma.
The Community will want a Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: In two opposing votes, the Council decided to establish a Community space in the future ageing housing system.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the missing part has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still last until the area of the church is in the community, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community space for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to oppose the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with around 70 square meters space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Community Council will move forward, not only as a meeting place for the residents of the elderly but also as an open part of the Community.
For example, the word "strickcafé" made the rounds.
The decision, which has already been notified in the past by the provision of funds for the current budget, will be taken by means of promotional opportunities.
The building is located in the sanitation area.
The establishment of a Community space would, according to Tjaden, be profitable by 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision to signal to the investor that in this regard there is no link between the legs, the determination that both satellites - what is involved in environmental construction - and Puldach - would be possible to reduce the level of confidence and economic growth.
Unnecessary, that's not just Wilfried Sohmer, be this addition.
If's helping, he's going through the gremium.
It's not that simple at the Community level.
Daniela Ruf refers to many of her own buildings, with which you do not go so directly, so that you can get out of the window at the Community Hall, she says, "I'm hard to do this."
Yvonne Staiger speaks unconditionally of the Community area, however, absolutely against a community involvement.
It sees a hidden subsidy to independent or even external investors.
This is not true, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no appeal, but there is a real, inconsistencies that are marketable in doubt.
Mr Staiger's request to be duly extended to the proposal for a decision is three motions.
This remains the case with two votes in the original programme, which consists of Stefan Haller: "If we make the decision this way, we will make a huge step towards closing a major failure in our infrastructure".
Car collusion: Radler is locked on the street
On the road, a 82-year-old driver was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday.
As reported by the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on his way by 12.20 p.m. with his bike on the way to the street Blacker Road from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the height of the street At Buchholzer Busch.
A PKW leader in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long field ran along the road, however, he apparently did not notice the opposite.
He joined a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was locked on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought into a hospital with a retweet.
FC Bayern Munich has to ignore David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borusia Dortmund
The Supercup finds no place for him: David Alaba has to leave the game against Dortmund.
With personal care, the FC Bayern travels to the first stage of the new season to Dortmund.
Seven professions are missing the title protector in the Supercup against the poker winner.
Staff care at the German football record teacher Bayern Munich will be ever larger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pocalsieger Borusia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also forget about David Alaba in duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Münchners are missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boating, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five downloads in the previous six test games, Ancelotti took responsibility for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the play of his team.
"We know we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is balance in the team.
It wasn't good at all."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season.
"Fößball is also tactical, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my men show these qualities.
The men are ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expected a "hard, intense game".
The Dull of both German football weights draws the fans into their band.
The party was sold with 81,360 visitors, sharing the German Football League (DFL) on Friday.
Wander in the heart of stars to stars
In the harz the first "star path" is to be created underground.
This plant of the United Star Warte Sankt Andreasberg.
There has been a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" is contrary to the information needs of many hair visitors, it has.
It binds nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to build along the planned route tables and to inform them about stars and images.
In a first phase by 2018, the Union plants "well-available installations in five to six locations" in the upper chamber.
Inquiries came from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Siber.
The information on the tables should be updated via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile reception is a role in the location selection.
Barrier freedom is also a criterion.
Then the star path should be extended to train.
"On the star path, viewers experience a great deal of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," said the Union.
They also learned why stars had different colors, or why one star was more bright than another, although it is much more distant.
It will also reveal in which star image there is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The Union has been operating since 2014 in St. Andreasberg in the mountains of northern Germany.
The centre of the National Park Harz is the sixth darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Agency for Natural Protection.
It is often seen from there from the milk street and even the Andromeda galaxy with only eyes.
Since 2003, there has been something similar to the planned planetary orbit - the planetary path.
Starting before Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path leads to the Hainberg and to the Stargate - as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets, including the degraded plane at the end of the planet, are located at a distance of up to two billion.
The earth thus falls on a ball of 6.5 millimetres diameter, while the sun, which is about 70 inches [75 cm] away, is still missing.
The entire distance of the planet's path is well four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours, footsteppers need a good hour to stand with Pluto.
So footstepers are faster than the light in the world.
The March to the next fixture, however, would last another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to invest the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unencumbered World Boxing Council Lightweight Championship, the river went down to welcome Lomachenko to the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Championship.
After Garcia's victory by a unanimous decision on the former four-division World Master Adrian Broner on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds for pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I want you very happy."
Lomachenko defends his throat against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19 o'clock on ESPN.
When the pair took the photo, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm an ex-feder weight," recalled Garcia.
"I'm going up for a bronze [about 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move to light weights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that has to fight Lomachenko with a 135-pound deck this year in order to agree on a date with Garcia next summer (37-0.30 Knockouts) of the same interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in Pay-per-View mode, because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and went out to fight the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can make this kind of attention.
When they're always ready ... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he might be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko listened to the great praise for Garcia and said that he thought that the triangular champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted the Ko-Aus."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then box it.
They both said they could smell the moment they built for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighter, and that's Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Four-in-a-Row Place
In one accident on the A7, four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before 16.30 p.m. on the market site.
The Pkw pushed right into the box, where he stepped over and then sat on the roof in the trunk.
The four Insassins - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the victims by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked in the north for about an hour and could then be prevented from driving on the left road at the accident site.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after 2:2 the season's peak against Braunschweig, the optimization of the conversion formation will bring to Aue points.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, as well as the result, the two geniuses would not have been at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was a lot of two geniuses, and we have to look even better at Aue," said the actor of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the mountains, the triangles should also be optimised.
And a door after a freehouse doesn't want to catch the fortunes anymore.
"For the future, it will be so that no one else is on the line near Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better suited to the three-pointer than to the four-pointer.
"I still don't know how to act in Aue," said his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players who can build well in the three-storeys at half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giethelmann," said Hoffmann.
"It's a preposition, but that we're even better harmonizing and we don't make so many mistakes in building."
Of course, Hoffmann also runs to Aue to win the game.
"But you can talk after a misunderstanding from a failed start, you don't know.
The performance could be through all right," said Hoffmann.
"But if we come down on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pocal, we will certainly be able to speak from a regular season."
His trainer didn't want to know anything about it.
"I consider the start of the season only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak out of an advantage against Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be broken down in advance because of an unwelcome.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, since they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a height advantage in the bones.
"But they don't know where they are at 100 percent," says Fortune's internal defense.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as light favorite on Sunday to meet at the final (fast) stage of Aue.
"That we remove them, only because we have the claim to come under the first six," says Fückel, whose balance is too positive in just a sub-position against aue from nine games.
"There is no man in the 2nd Bundeslaga, which must be beaten first," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"It would be arrogant and excessive to make such a statement."
And that's how Functional wants his players to experience no case on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum assessment test published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been submitted to a new method for the medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicines (JRC) has started the testing in the past year.
During the asylum process, they should strengthen the appreciation of the elderly after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrating Network) has been criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of certain refugees who were under years.
To date, migration has sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results from 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eightty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while the Forensic Medicine Agency was further assessed that the person was "maybe 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in the past months.
"We see no great difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years of age does not mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "proposing that the person studied was 18 years old".
When reviewing the 581 published results published by the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, she concluded that in 243 of these cases the person had publicly said that it would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, when taking away wisdom gaps and MRT withdrawals from bone links, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticised in some areas.
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological range of people to see whether they went before or later as usual through puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk lies where the person is almost below 18, in this case it is about 10 percent."
Full Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well ahead.
In the middle of the week, a heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the east entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Baulier, at the Department of Road Affairs and Transport in the Freiburg government Bureau.
In April the work began at the same time at all three necessary healing bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is planned for October and is easy to be sure that the timetable will be maintained.
The first bridge, from Schramberg, leads to the trombach.
It is a cotton-covered bridge from concrete, which is covered with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, they have come in the middle of the years.
In order to ensure stability and transport safety, the three constructions are now thoroughly repaired.
The two other bridges run over the Louterbach.
They are built from red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, relatively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge on the site of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 metres wide and seven tons of heavy bridge heads on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border attachment which is also used as a mode of operation.
On the south side of the bridge, a width of 2,20 metres will be used on Friday.
Then walk the path.
This is especially because it is part of this, a patent of Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge heads.
Special fingerprints have required guidance through the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fascist cable that has been connected to many companies.
The inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand list.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the assembly hall in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by an apple.
For the construction at the bridge at the Louterbach location entrance the road in the bridge is completely closed at the height of the hotels "tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three bridge repairs shall be EUR 700 000 together.
It will be financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German Cartofel salt
This is not often the case, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is only hard to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the round of the volcano (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad band that shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteine Town hall roundell calls for a "great election target".
And a well-known name brings to the start - as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on 24 September, and the former federal president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already at the beginning of the event do not want to listen to the AfD teachers, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eiffel remains bung."
The city picknick was originally planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fireplace, but now it is located on the parking lot below the corner - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a beautiful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forum A World and one of the key organizers, is really happy: "Toll, how many people have come together here."
There is music and every amount of food, including a "urdish potatoes salad that could also eat the AfD without trouble," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to go to Gerolstein, showing presence in particular at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the event types.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulcaniefel that he had tried to make such an event and received the invitation.
The 45-year-olds from Gönnersdorf had first been questioned in Daun, but there was a complaint because there were not enough parking spaces for the already built Laurentius.
Now the roundall, hompes, is glad that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Looking at the event on the round table, he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also done: at 20 o'clock a band for maintenance in the city hall of several speakers, including the state-of-the-art President Uwe Young.
In the hall there are about 200 audiences waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch to hold their talks.
The police presence is unchanged, but the officers had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, which guests on the front floor have a longer breath, but there is also a short walk of 21 hours.
The police can't cancel - no special charges.
Trompete Trophy
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he has a concert under the motto "Black Sea hits on black wall", or also "Balkan folklore" on a classic German training with candles in the Blazen music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompter at the renowned concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Solopopopounist of the SWR Symphonie Orchester.
Both combine the luxury not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to mix the limits of the different generations.
So explains Johann Sebastian Bach to the two as in a new game, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the "Exchange Suite" section of the jazz priest Niles Wogram, the classic, jazz and free games are transformed into a fascinating overall art.
This programme's core was launched this morning with great success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it for the two musicians and more: The Haslascher monastery church with its special austic will be conscious of being involved in the concert.
Kristin Stewart talks about her sexuality
"Some people love frozen cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart clearly about her sexuality.
"When I'm in a broken box, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what comes next?'
The well-known relationship of Hollywoodstar was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who was finally a bit of different.
Nevertheless, the brilliant painter assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with every thing I've done.
Or do you think I was playing it?"
After her separation, Kristen pointed out that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it's not bothering me or stopping me.
I didn't want it to be taken seriously."
In particular, she said, "Bang Showbiz" but in school, when she loved to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me, I'd look like a bub.
I really felt touched, embarrassed and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, ‘ Girls, be proud of you!’
In particular, the public does not want to express their love for life: "People expect you to be treated in a certain way and that hurts me.
And maybe some of them call me impenetrable, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The governor of West Virginia announces he's changing the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced a Donner-to-Speech event with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with much prayer and much thought ... today I will tell you as a West Virginia resident, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The customer service was in Jubel.
"In the morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously made a big announcement at West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not credit democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes of the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five countries and has stolen a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday, in which it said: "The change of the party by Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us from working more than that to re-grow our country."
"With only 15 Governments and the control of the smallest legal entities in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party from above to below and unable to find a positive message," RNC president Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "relative" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world chief of Light Telematics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a public apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be taken back into the sport.
During the IAAF Congress, Russia's Lichtatellek chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the night of the Lichttelöktek World Championships that his country's association was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were expelled from the gold and silver medals in competition."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress agreed on the maintenance of the ban, which was held in November 2015, following a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on State-supported Doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe said to the rapporteur.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation had recognized itself that it had experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he would also be "satisfied" about accepting Russia's criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-enter Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean Athletics from the broken system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will be represented in the Light Telecommunications World Championships, which begin in London on Friday, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The leader of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a reconfiguration.
Drugentets are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a speech at the IAAF Council.
Traumatic equipment for soldiers in Mali
In a sad holiday in the northern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers who came to Mali during a hijacking raid.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Judgment under high security conditions.
The defense minister Ursula from the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the yet unexplained cause of disturbance.
She called the two rounded pilots, but she referred to them as "the queen of her career."
"We welcome this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old staff chief from Nordessen had arrived on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their wounds were transferred to Germany and brought on Thursday with a funeral of the federal war in the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
At first, only the members of the church accepted Abschied.
The family, close friends, representatives of the federal government, and politics began to celebrate the holiday.
Hessens was also President Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Weeker.
The sad guests put roses down, the members stood poor in arm on the strings.
Before the church, the ceremony was followed by freezlars and many soldiers.
The defense minister of the Leyen referred to the surrounding soldiers as "high decorated" and operating procedures.
The Stabshaupmann has built the flight operation of Tiger's fighter in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
Volker Bauershas, commander of the regime, to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this occupation could not be eliminated, no one would have been able to do so."
No doubt at the UN mission in Mali, Minister of the League did not show: the use was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the mourning party, the tears were brought out of the court.
When and where they are ordered, the Federal War did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave in front of his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be ordered in addition to his wife after his death.
That was part of the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish King's couple is represented in the Domkirch of Roskilde.
The Bilhauer Björn Nørgaard has already completed a Sarkopoghag for the two.
If the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it's still unclear.
But he did not intend to be included in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a joke that he wasn't happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's throne in 1972, he was pleased to become king.
In 2016 he went to peace and also released the title "Principle Hall".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equal to his wife - neither after death, Lene Balleby, the head speaker of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last silence of the 83 years will be final, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be included in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
Henry de Laborne de Monpezat, son of a French Adele family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the subject he worked in the French message.
While his later wife was constantly plagued by the people's sympathies, Prince Henrik had a difficult situation in his nearly 50-year-old government with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first year in Denmark: "Some months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was changing, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk drums instead of bars, lemons instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gaulois, which I used to smoke instead of Virginia tobacco, and these countries had the call to be the brand of social critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope to see.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed of me.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants to rush Neuwahl
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
The Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is not willing to return after the loss of the red-green government power for a fast update of the country's day, but he does not want to return.
Because on Friday, we are talking about the resolution of Parliament.
Prior to the surprise of a Green Aborigines from their group of countries in the Netherlands, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) had hit the government in a severe crisis.
Five months before the official deadline of the country elections, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its short majority vote in Parliament against the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Absornets, Elke Twersten, founded their step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their selection circle in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thomler wants to recommend that his group take them.
To this end, CDU and FDP had 69 seats in the Dutch Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
Until then, the relationship was reversed.
The new country day will be selected regularly on 14 January.
Thomler said that the red-green government should now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without the majority.
Stephan Weil, however, makes it unnecessary that the day of the country will decide its own solution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on the Tuesday on its further proceedings.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the country's president will withdraw the trust and choose a successor on the day of the country.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be legally checked," Thumler said.
"A man will be able to discuss all questions in peace if they are legally verified."
Thomler called Twesten's step "but something cool."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a rapporteur.
I feel very good."
She called herself an attachment to Black Green.
The Greens called on the dissuasive Members to return their country's mandate.
"We naturally understand that she received her country day-to-day mandate, which she received from the Green List, is immediately coming back," the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner shared with her.
The chairman of the Green Group, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of each of the two extremes".
She has decided not to speak in the group.
"Even before the background there were no substantive differences, we can't follow this step."
SPD-Canzler candidate Martin Schulz condemns the overranting of the Dutch Green Abbreviations Every Tweets to CDU as a traitor.
"The behaviour of the former Green Aborigines in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters and voters, but also a violation of Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
It supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country.
The east coast of Twesten costs the majority of Red Greens in Lower Saxony.
The politician is "in her ill-treatment and in her marriage her personal interests before the welfare of the country", criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony takes over and tries to defeat political capital."
Nedersachsens CDU fractional Chief Björn Thomler would recommend that his members take each tweet into the CDU.
The Head of the SPD's Group on Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested that Twitter, with personal career memories, should have the result of the 2013 country election.
The CDU was the strongest force, SPD and Green before the SPD, but on the ground day, a high-end majority of a vote.
Minister of Agriculture at the interview - How do we protect ourselves from weddings, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing frozen eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the German Network (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from contaminated eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the voice pressure.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.foodstelwarnung.de, the Federal countries will provide the latest information on the eggs concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know now, a health threat is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible response to the crisis - all the eggs from the offer - because the central role of the publisher by the German Minister of Agriculture is not really taken seriously?
Food surveillance is the task of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Nevertheless, my house has been suddenly shut down and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany was announced.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade has the same concern as that of the manufacturer that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, these are not transportable.
However, unpaid eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not liable.
Do production companies and consumers sit on the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, production companies are not liable directly.
More and more, they must be able to deal with economic damage due to the illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controls.
Is it only in the staff or also in the crucial responsibility?
However, it was just the official controls that covered the process.
However, it is also true that food consumption and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 per cent.
That is why a consistent explanation of such cases and the transfer to State administrations in cases in which penalties may be imposed is of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to make an unfavourable statement.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food canals?
Consumers and consumers have the right only to obtain safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food business, consumers and consumers are entitled to be treated.
Through the pan-panned means manufacturers, dealers and consumers have been placed in a situation that is not absolutely necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: The illegal use of fipronil in the maintenance of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be discontinued immediately.
This must be consistent at all levels and worked with high pressure.
I expect all the competent authorities to make the matter clear slowly and smoothly.
How the financial rules of the football are affected by the conversion to Paris to Neymars
The rules aimed at preventing the expenditure of the European Football Federation will not interfere with the passage from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Germain, Neymars World Record Transfer.
Some consequences are still coming from the UEFA for Paris Saint Germain, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to prevent people from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules, which were adopted in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG must at once prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a loan of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars' return to France.
PSG can certainly make the money locker so that Neymar can sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team through the power of the rich lord family of Qatar.
One can use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but it is necessary to control legitimate input sources that allow them to break-even points in their business on football.
FFP was appointed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that the union that had successfully assumed enormous debt in their efforts was effectively corrupt and threatened to ruin themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP lost its focus on the debt of the club to the monitoring of its losses.
The amendment meant that the business model, originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the population and build a global brand - should be a more difficult issue.
During the current three-year FFP implementation period, which runs until 2018, Clubs may take losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini 2015 has fallen into Uganda by the Presidency, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin continues to refrain from excessive expenditure.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traversso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a pause scale, it can share the amount for the calculation of the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the cancellation for the next five years can be expressed at EUR 44.4 million at the end of the year.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG with Abu Dhabi, who is owned by Manchester City, with the worst sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time, 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was agreed that the team members for the 2014/15 season champions would remain limited to 21 players instead of the remaining 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to overlook their financial perspective by monitoring their revenue by companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a catalytic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship would exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this as a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was highlighted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar from the WM 2022 organisation committee.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have argued that Neymar will become a WM messenger and could be an easy target for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to break the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.
They speak under the condition of anonymousity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of over EUR 542.4 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last business year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymars to arrive is a victory for sponsoring dealers, merchandising and Trikot sales.
The agreement follows that the turnover will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars from getting away by claiming that PSG would damage the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's latest ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose union is owned by an American sports tycoons, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a union.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a union, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair because there are different ways or different interests when a country has such a large actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Scotch supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Free Board chocolate has been produced for the Swiss.
Now the sweet co-operation is before a possible end: The airlines are writing the order again.
Swiss speecher Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on the request of the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the Airlines will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be tested every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolate Free," said the speaker.
About 17 million small rotted wooden tables of 14 grams a year share the flight crew before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industry sides estimate the order volume according to "Northern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual rate of about one billion francs.
More importantly, however, is the advertising power: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
As many bidders are present at the new release, the Swiss will not report.
However, only Swiss producers are concerned.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to try to update the agreement on spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss chocolate tables have been distributed on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Free.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the first class with lecheries from the Confectionery Sprüngli, in the business class next to the passenger Scoggier by Lindt and in the economy class Scoggy by Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short track, Swiss Shoggi is distributed by Chocolate Frey, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Lyrics - Discus-Olympian Robert Harting gets to the WM-Finale
The dream world master fights on Saturday at the end of a medal.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympicser, was divided into the national WM award and could only be seen by the tribe.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish champion of the title Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 meters far away, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nice
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s, for the 90th-year-old Grand-year era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a body of our Facebook capable memories.
But as Franchise, it feels like time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original story of a oral dose of Gemüse, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By hiding on the core of the gag - middle-aged players play funny children who will grow up - they still made it possible to win back the last part of the verse.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionalized and his parishioner goes more according to the gay principle, including a riff on the speaker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point a character is blocked by an Apple Powerbook, some inline shocks and "a number of other things since 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanuator, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there is yet another crazy-bad plot, included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the French.
It makes a great deal of fun to see young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's subtlety of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old kid.
There are the moments of random thought that this French may be associated with as a sort of continuous "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiums of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds us of another type of Nostalgia: the repeat of the Cold War of "The Americas", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its east-west Ringfighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka presents Rhys Thomas as director to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two bureaucracy officers fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism.
The main trolls - a hard-cut Gregor and an idealistic iOSef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on television, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures an excellent game 'Find out the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the reality of a double propaganda drama - a killer who wears a giant mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
At six long episodes, it tends to be there, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited for a longer period, could deliver his agitprop satires better, since Gregor and Iofe are always visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who break a hamburger's neck.
The message for the imaginated Communist Republic is that Western culture can make everything for food for a living.
The fictional Romanian Creators are not wrong: We do it even with our own younger history and with theirs.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police have won a battle against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were examined in the Blackwald Bar Cross, in Rottweil, Kontweil, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state government government Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons between 25 and 77 years of age have been arrested and have already been ordered by the court.
In addition, officials assured the largest amounts of marijuana and cocaine, arms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspicious Italians, there were German court orders.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were employed.
The members of the Mafia are threatened with organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, and rape and rape.
Since the summer of 2016, the state administration has identified Constance against organised drug trafficking in the South German area.
Between the state administrations in Konstanz and Palermo there was a government exchange and the authorities of Kripo Rottweil had close daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
This is why the large employment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In the visit to the investigation, in particular Italian nationals referred to the Italian Mafia.
An incident also occurred on May 27, in Hüfingen, at which several shots were fired in a guesthouse early in the morning, should be taken to the band account.
How great gaps in the foreign register are reported
"Citizens' data that should not be found": A report follows that the foreign register in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious decisions in asylum procedures.
The Federal Government's refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen Way, has then made a media report on major gaps in the foreign central register.
Mistakes in the data recorded there could lead to asylum procedures and discharges "to some serious errors," cautioned in an analysis of the "South German newspaper".
The register includes 10 million people with foreign citizenship, including 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are then managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data were not sufficiently stored, the data quality in parts was not good until.
In some cases, data were found from 1921, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens, and should not actually appear in the register."
"Inaccurate data inputs can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
In the statistics on travelable persons, there have been overcrowded EU citizens who have not even had to travel.
However, such false arrangements led to "a forgotten debate on dealing with travel officials", which is why the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-olds back to Italy when they are expelled from there.
The report of the "New Osnabrück newspaper" reports on the move from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
In the paper, therefore, the BAMF is leading such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually no longer possible, so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation in front of the place.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees in the EU are responsible for their first arrival.
If a migrant continues to live in another EU country, this country can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has granted the reception and accommodation of families guarantees.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) held these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back in the framework of the Dublin Agreement.
The political speaker of the left-wing group in Bundesag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Familys with children suffer from the lack of human rights conditions in the Italian asylum system and a threat to the child's welfare".
The second highest result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in the Upper Hemisphere have already made blood donation available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were appointed on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared between 100 pounds between 50 litres of blood with it.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the House of Commons, the community should be prepared to donate blood several times.
"It's great how our body is designed for it, and we're going to give the donors respect that makes their blood available to foreigners, still unusable," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, the director of the Red Cross.
Three people could already benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbachers reported on the actions carried out in Oberreibach in the spring.
"In this year, we achieved the second result with 114 contributors," said the DRK-Creation Leader.
Apparently, the change in theater has led to higher attendance rates a few years ago.
Previously, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer had been counted to be the multiplicity and were awarded for each 50 blood pounds.
Half of them sold Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent every 500 millilitre of their livelihood.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to be informed later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the decline in inflation have caused speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "due" when it maintains interest rates on family income in a growing pressure.
The Bank's monetary committee's policymakers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates by 0.25 % this month, while less members sought an increase because the weak economic growth had failed to support an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth projections for 2017 to 1.7% and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on the budget income would continue, with inflation in the brain likely to rise to less than 3%.
But she pointed out that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to reduce the inflation generated by Brexit and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut Conjuncture Package issued a year after the Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide more cheap financial resources for banks from February to February, although it was said that it is now expected that it will make $15 billion more available under this system - with 115 billion sterling.
Following the decision on interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (BIP) remains short-lived, as the pressure on the actual income of households continues to cause consumption."
To the interest rates, she added that "a certain monetary policy penalty" would be necessary to mitigate inflation and to a "something bigger" scale than the markets expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would "progressively" and "limited".
According to the Bank's adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year, there are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasted May.
It has maintained its growth forecast by 1.8% in 2018.
The fund fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro.
The fund fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision shall not be amended after the latest declining growth rates have increased the higher expectations of interest and the GDP in the second quarter has increased by 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The growth is expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easily recovered from the bank at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report is a little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and low levels of income, as the deterioration will be even worse before it will be improved.
It added that in the next few years money policy cannot 'stop income', but it added that the wages will be 'extended' by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is to return to the weak funds, which will compensate part of the lower consumption costs.
The decision will be reached one year after the decline in interest rates by 0.25 % in the last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the fund's fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably last for four years until the prices and the economy are fully achieved.
Prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call was increased after a interest rate increase, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 % in June last month to 2.6 %, although the bank said that this was expected and that it would be reinvigorated in the coming months.
The bank said that the surplus in relation to its 2% target was "ganz" to write the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, director at Corco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive, as credit providers are looking for jobs and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market is particularly good for those who run the existing dealers and finish the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to write HIV-Drugs 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in NHS after a conflict in September before the High Court.
NHS England reported that a single pre-exposition profile (PREP) that may reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients is now provided by health services over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He explained that he was ready to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed in the past year that the NHS had the power to pay the PREP in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The announced shock on Thursday was welcomed by NHS Head of England Simon Stevens as "a major new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it "a different moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be allowed to register, and further clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexpositions propylaxe (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected patients.
PrEP before taking sex means that there are just enough medicines in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or every two hours before sexual activity.
Those who are concerned with treatment include weak or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transmissors and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered in a household can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be signed by £10 million and NHS England under a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study should assess the total potential of PrEP by collecting clinical sites, how it is used, collected and implemented at a high level.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should achieve and sustain the continued and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is directed to needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that will be really individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner that will improve many, many lives.
We wholeheartedly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, president of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to conduct the study quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be released.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been created, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said: "The start of the PREP process is followed by monthly delays and short-term implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative these drugs can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection can end.
This attempt brings us closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society'.
The big life: Interconnected and smart designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a huge house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, was reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and there is evidence for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely overrun.
Initially, a single room presence with an exposed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a room and an intermission to use the large deck height optimally.
"I wanted high decks, big window, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, who used 12.5 feet high decks and created a house that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck wasn't big enough to place two spaces together, so the architectural challenge was to create an interconnection in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel works are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without writing us.
It was not only to build a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full order - with a lot of additional drama.
For the interstakes, a classic bathroom window of retrouvius is below the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is stored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, the stored units offer a place for all of Joanne's tickets and glasses.
By taking a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Combustible kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing is that it's about a garage.
"A little engineering art went in there," explains the acquirer from the reinforced MDF door.
"It's against weight, so when you lift the door, it's very easy to walk."
Thanks to the smooth use of room and restaurant, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will be sold the basic area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, an real estate broker will be introduced and a calculation will be carried out on the ground size."
Here they have managed to expand the surface and use high-quality materials that make the space more luxurious.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't like the electric shocks in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed by good design and increase the number of square meters from something standardable to something completely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you can decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades old, after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in exchange for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires of over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis live in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how his property and business assets should be distributed.
Paul had been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but a sharp exchange of views on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since 1973 the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans founded the family and grew into a chain of 160 single trades.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the city.
After an agreement with her deceased father Colin - described Paul as "the chief operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul a third.
One court case states that this means Colin owns $316 million and Paul owns $176 million.
The distribution of property and money has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The allocations proposed by Colin have left him with what I had for the best objects," he wrote in a first afidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on the last Friday after several disseminating statements.
The brothers are also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some possessions in an incompatibility.
In an early Affidavit, introduced by Colin, he says he hopes to help the fight.
"My Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Carter Keck Cramer, and with leading legal disputes, including Allan Myers, QC, and the legal channels held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and retail business from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeanslade of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he "was in my last year of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their son.
"Luigi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Company Group, while Colin argues that Mark was paid for leaving the company $10 million and Luke 26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation have been hampered".
Colin was very supportive, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded via SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to blame me and take our family names by court," he wrote.
In mid 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to end in our current fight," he said and added that he "always hope for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be too short.
"Our case will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trumps of the new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media presence of the President.
Others have tried it and have been broken.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the media, in the hope of keeping the head on a similar course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, met on his first day of work with leading employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that was in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should be flown - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he would get good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to break through by monitoring his media record.
President Trump's relationship to television has been back for decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was disappointed by a poor reporting capacity, it was productive to show him that he received a good reporting of positions that were to be convinced," former electorate Sam Nunberg said against politics in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a constant price of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something we don't know about others - that Trump Tweets would have contained more incense without their interventions.
We're probably never gonna learn anything about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees had already made it a few times, taking care of him, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trup from generating controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house, composed of competitive parties, always try again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico - all of which is concerned with this story - reported in May on the desire of the Council to provide the President with information that is questionable for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trup officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative printouts, especially with damaged lights, and that he understands where they come from.
At the very end of February, when someone kindly printed a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the former Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a dog of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been forced out of Twitter for the sake of Shikani, he has not offered any concrete evidence or has in the past exposed false claims and rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperroom, to obtain the trumpet".
How did it go?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people's assistance will be requested and expected.
The police are sending in this summer (virtually) postcards to dangerous criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the sought perpetrators are not known in nature, evidence from the population is hoped and prayed.
Europol reported on the Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from the winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding from vacation destinations, they have been from Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for sought offenders from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website has been available on www.eumoswanted, more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed.
36 of the online messages could be determined so far, at least 11 of them, due to indications after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionary Line'
Some of the most fortunate owners of the West Midlands are once again with some determined travelers on war foot who have treated one of the graves taken from the community to request a field before their master houses.
Travellers have parked their 20 cars on a field outside a well-being street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionary series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after they were released in May only, without being forced off by a graveyard excavated by the Council to prevent their attacks.
The tactical group found a hole in the defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unstoppable to find a way.
The Council of Solihull, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They were taken to the Montagabend there after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement it because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were moved forward and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be named said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be picked up by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park."
A speaker from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country outside the street Brook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine if we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise will be
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is located.
The house in front of the gates of Freudunstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then-ambient business company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue was lost by the Kurtax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who arrived in the countryside, the hotel building was offered to Landrastamt as a meeting place, which provided for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the introduction of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not then contested in the House.
But above all, the mayor of the city, Julian Osswald, had defended the hotel location and had already spoken with serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with business leader Birgit Schererer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary expansion in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name of Woodhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the holiday town property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Lord Alb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Lucien Park, Parkote Luise and now Woodhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in the hands of construction container for a long time before the entrance, and if you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be carried out.
The floors were removed, covered in part, removed old bathrooms from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still much to do by March.
"It's really a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be updated in the blackish style.
The rooms are equipped with large accessible showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything will be "good citizen" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the equipment.
You don't want to put yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but you're already at a high inner town level, stressing assailant.
The Woodhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be built wide, explains Scherser further.
Both individual passengers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause have already been conducted, such a pity.
The city's performances are as comprehensive as those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the level of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to establish himself exactly.
Almost a million euros, he calculated.
The external facilities are also brought to the frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freuden City is a good market".
Russia Affairs: US Special Mediar places Grand Jury in
In the Russian case of US President Donald Trump, Special Mediar Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
In the past few weeks, the team has taken up the work, writing the "Wall Street Journal" on people trusted in the matter.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his findings.
The CNN sender reported that it had already given the first reports of the Panel in relation to a meeting between the oldest son of the trups and a Russian lawyer.
US Secret Services have been accusing the Kreml for a long time, aiming at joining the presidential elections in 2016.
Mueller examined whether there were discussions between the Tromps election team and Moscow.
On the basis of the findings, several men were to act as advisers to the Republican in the election struggle.
As a result, Mueller also received more and more drums of private and business environment under the Lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediar Trump had personally returned to the centre and examined the matter whether the president might have prevented justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and decide whether the charges should be raised.
Thus, Grand Jurys are also known as the complainants.
At least they are activated when it comes to larger and more controversial cases.
The procedure is always behind closed doors.
The panel can also be activated by the government administration to invite people to be admitted under the auspices of Eid.
According to the CNN sender, allegations have already been made regarding the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that the persons involved in the meeting had been invited to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's consultant and Swiss son Jared Kushner as well as his former electoral leader, Paul Manafort, were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday in the U.S. television that the application shows that Mueller does not leave himself attractive in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be finally activated to decide on the collection of a complaint.
However, the introduction of the Group of the beginnings of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new enthusiasts, the president used a talk in West Virginia to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total discovery," said Trump.
The theme gives Democrats an opportunity to "feel well, because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the introduction of a grand jury.
However, these work usually also in secret, he stressed.
The White House supported any measures that speeded up the work of the Special Ombudsman in a "fare" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey has three times said he won't speak against the presidents.
There is no reason to accept that something has changed in this regard, the statement continued.
But Mueller was first used after Trump Comey was fired.
Because of this rupture, anti-tump charges were brought against him, and he wanted to stop the justice.
Comay said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump had asked him to make a statement against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the U.S. media show, the white house material was collected against the special mediator and his staff.
The resulting speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to quit.
Unlike an independent specialist at the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affairs case about the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller had a position in which he could be theoretically burned at the pressure of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that could not be left so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Eisberg runs in Antarctica
In the Western Arctic, a giant Eisberg was dissolved by the nearly seven-fold Berlin size of the selfeis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
More than a billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large colossus are now heading north, and it will probably take two, three years before it falls.
It is one of the largest icebreakers that researchers have recorded in the past three decades and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
A danger to humans does not depart from him.
As far as the climate change has played a role in the eruption of Eisberg, it is unclear after research.
However, there has been a series of unusual outbreaks of ice pellets in the region for some 30 years, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to earthquakes.
The now broken Colossian was still part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
So it keeps growing into the sea and comes out regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula in South America.
North of this sculpture was the equivalent of growth and interruptions a few years ago.
A complete sculptor is there, writes AWI Professor Daniela Jansen.
Some say that the Larsen C scale is also in danger, because the front edge has never returned as far as now.
In addition, the ice disk is under pressure and may fall if a piece is broken at a key station.
The melting of selfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as it swims on the water and the ice melts as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the sculpture leads to the fact that the glaciers can fly directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This could increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest of the Antarctica's four-dimensional ski resorts.
It is up to 700 meters thick on the front edge of the free ocean.
That's where it starts regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the icechild is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the highest return since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Scientists would argue that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will now grow again or will be back in the long run and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Lukkman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last for decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring the collapse of this giant iceberg to the climate change, in the past decades, there have been many ice pellets of the Antarctic peninsula.
This long line of Antarctica extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey programme, the Arctic peninsula has been back some 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees and therefore numbers to the areas where the temperature is rapidly rising.
CDU wants home count on personal
Since it is becoming increasingly difficult to establish free jobs, the CDU requires that they be excluded from the labour market in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, 41 new positions in the administration were opened on Wednesday.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
Now, once again, 17 trainees are behind their first day of work.
The teachings at the circle are obviously very popular.
About 620 applications were to be registered for the places to be granted this year.
However, the circle requires further staff to be able to handle the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are more than 50 unaccompanied positions in Mettmann's circle.
Among other things, doctors and engineers are sought, as well as the powers of the general administration.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on Wednesday and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
The Management Board shall, as requested by the Parties, develop a concept for the acquisition and development of staff.
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals but also to address the future of the customer's speed.
The overall concept should be focused on inside and outside, identify concrete measures for core builders and include a training subjective, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's already a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities hire good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is from a regular "competitive competition of the public employer".
In addition, there are a large number of employees who separate from the service the condition of sickness or old age.
So the maximum time to deal is not to be left unattended.
However, Klaus-Dieter Peoples, head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint application with his party.
He was already worried about a sudden surprise on Wednesday, when he asked about the issue of personal costs and the rest of the parties.
Peoples want to examine all the possibilities that enable an exit from the municipal employment association.
"If we do not come here recently to a satisfactory solution, the management of the circle with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the neighbouring cities - should seek a housing policy," people say.
Thus, the CDU seeks to pay employees and employees better than it actually provides for the tariff standard for the public service.
The holders are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money is available only if you change to a higher level that focuses on years of employment.
However, the tasks of the circle have been growing ever more and more over the years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up, in which employees would have to care for the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least by the rising number of asylum seekers, Landratet Thomas Hendele and circle director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy strengthens the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs to use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Young Retett' because their crew had effectively worked with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has been in operation for the first time in a year, has helped to make it possible for the Italian government to issue a detailed proposal from Ambrogio Cartosio.
"It is for us and the salvation of human life remains our highest priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in an opinion to the social media.
"We can only assess all the charges currently raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Young Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew is taking on board ship migrants delivered directly by human dealers and that the smugglers can be removed so that ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the State Council, whose contents were published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of being influenced by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, to monitor rescue facilities in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the code of conduct, ships such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have already declared themselves ready to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
On Thursday, he said that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, since they would not bring with themselves "a significant change or impediments" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winning organization is doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti said, however, that the number of migrants who came after the rescue measures in Italy had gone very far in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors had been made.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are hoping to reach Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Upgrading and trials
Nine Weilerer Biker, the "Berliner External Posts" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the Northphalz to enjoy long trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley is a good starting point for the tourists.
The borough and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the winebergs to Michaelskaskelle above Deidesheim.
There were following points of view, partly on doors, from which you could look far across the forest and the proposed levels.
In the meantime, there have been further increases in the long-term trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, focus is selected on perspective, connected by "floating" trials and moderate increases.
During the last two days, many heights were repeated.
The hills, the rocks, the towers, the castles, the ruins and the toilets brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers enter the holiday hall of the Holy Sun.
Neustadt was also attacked.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres high, the group had met the Fälzer forest on its best side - sports and cultural -.
Console instead of Races - Bundesliga races for e-Sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting over the stadium races by wind and weather?
The fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, into a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high legs.
This has also been recognised by the first German legislators who are increasingly engaged in this field.
In 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, established an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professions for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to encourage all new young target groups for VfB," says President Jochen Rötgermann.
He's sure "that there's still some unity on this train."
The next week, the FIFA World Federation organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the players of different clubs interact with each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint Germain or the PSV Endhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Liverkusen and Werder Bremen tells about an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football needs to be intertwined with the 14 to 30 years of age, that young people are going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The Unions are trying to overcome all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under the contract, one could be more often present on these markets than only once a year to send the Federal Union to Asia.
What's going on?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Doto 2", "Conterstrike" or "FIFA football simulation are also featured on competition levels.
In the long run, as in normal sport, lies have been established in which the professions interact with each other.
And in 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But it's all about the right kind of sport?
For many, the idea of normalization is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also been discussing the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sports - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response ability.
Professional players should train their bodies and take care not only of the console but also of the food.
"The fat player is a good player."
Frobose also sees problems: "Doping will become more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientists have a positive influence on the high integration of e-sport.
The players are internationally on their way, which is like a large global family, because there is no intercultural barrier.
A study of the company’s advice Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Maintenance Software (BIU) tells the e-sport that there is a tremendous growth ahead.
In 2016, 50 million euros were spent in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years the turnover will be at 130 million.
This is a small amount of Euro 2.4 billion of the football-Bundeslaga.
However, whether the E-Sport "is no longer far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or Eishockey", the Deloitte-Berator writes.
International is already in place in many countries.
Large markets are Asia and the USA where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood chess player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Wettner Unikrn.
In Europe, too, there are some things that we can do.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a teaching course, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football-first-time companies, according to Dutt, are obliged to establish an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison Germany is behind it", states VfB-Prostat Rötgermann.
Only to fall into Nostalgia, and to explain the old times, is not enough today.
It is therefore necessary to preserve the tradition of the Union, but at the same time, the company is in the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dut.
"You can't say that it's just that everything is going to stay at the football game as it always was."
Gift-Eier ade - The Ei alternatives to cooking and bakery
The scandal of married eggs is affecting almost all federal countries.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and took all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs should be taken in the Kingdom, which do not contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter is condemned for the text that Conrad Roy uses to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be sentenced to 15 months of trial behind the gates and was sentenced to five years.
Carter was sentenced to life on 13 July 2014 because of the infamous murder of Conrad Roy.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is upset.
My son was my best friend."
Carter had to remain free until he was appointed.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
In red woods and a cream-colored blue, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with fallen hands and down his eyes when he was judged.
"Your actions have taken Conrad Roy," the state attorney told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own best.
She didn't take any responsibility," she said.
"It didn't show up."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "crazy condition which she completely regretted".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her "age or reifegradation or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions".
A state lawyer read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who said that "there's no day I don't care about the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will suffer for eternity with us," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be a aunt to his children.
"No more having this one person I've been with since my birth every day is a pain that I've always kept with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy died of carbon monoxide in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention to the fact that Carter’s text messages had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump out of a building, start yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in two weeks before her death while he and his family were on vacation.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Right Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and arranged that he should benefit from any press of the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
For the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death in 2007 by her British resident in Italy, was sentenced to two years before she was released.
Ms. Knox, aged 30, published in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Mille Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich had to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not an accident.
The FC Bayern won the Confed Cup winner for a great time - extra motivation does not damage that.
Something else was there at his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw right away, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.
But on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Newer to see, he kept the bonds assigned to him.
"The trainer has not announced it," said the confed-cop-winger, after his first use as the Bayern captain.
Well, the state could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the coach could say the same thing.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was selected as the leader of the existing professional C-Elf who was from young players, advocates and just from the holiday.
Sugarl is the most trusted of those who want to stay at Laun.
So those who have been deprived of the heritage of lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmych confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
In the middle of the week, the 22-year-olds fought as a mini-laham over the field.
Right back, that's his position now, the white binder on the arm made her rest.
And at the same time, Kimmich acted in this start-up format like the one who can take the wheel for the best.
He gave instructions to try to link the unplayed troops.
He had the view for all, while many others were working with themselves.
Vidal, in order to overcome his lack of fitness (claped nearly); Renato Sanches, to join demons in the services of the Asian voyage (clapsed only); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that they do not find any negative in their first appearance in the Bayern trip.
It was always very good.
The soul loved next to Kimmich, Rudy rose before the turn, both of them acting.
The so-called Napoli storm was often difficult, and the soul also tried to make itself successful several times in the game.
His colleague Rudy pointed out that the result was "not the way we expected it."
But he also showed proper performance at Debt.
Game resolution, time change: "I've been arrested for this style too."
As this Bayern world is still unaccompanied for the new arrivals, it was seen at the end of the party.
Rudy, for example, did not give in the catacombs one or two, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmych adopted a few cutting statements in the back of his new player.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
Still, he doesn't have to bring the new.
Alaba motivated by ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best known footballer has just reported on the game on Twitter and the ÖFB ladies wanted everything good.
The Bayern legioner is a ja quasi-club colleague of the ØFB Captain Schnaderbeck and celebrates with our Ladys.
The second of the Austrian football player of the year and champions League winner should be a special motivation prize.
The famous Bayern Dussel may also need our ladies.
Entrepreneurships satisfied with the ministry of the Rhineland-Pfalsic: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often designed as Eveline Lemke (Green) as a Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Pfalz.
This appears after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Houses and companies from the region speak on a T-V question of a change in economic policy - and tadaln at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, president of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Weissing reflects the wishes of the economy that has blocked the Lemke completely."
The biggest road use is Natus in infrastructure policy: The link between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is still looking forward to a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West Bank of Trier, which is in the pre-needed need of the Federal road transport plan.
The aim is to take action in December 2020, says Prime Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Trade Chamber (IHK) Trier, as Wissing has arranged for, in wine a Rhineland Pfalz label to increase the share in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to build a own company, the IHK commends.
The office room Trier sees an additional invitation for young educators in the new Master Bonus, says business leader Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 for the permanent master examination and EUR 2500 is expected if graduates make themselves independent within 10 years after master training.
However, the list of household duties for the country remains long.
At the time of the planned construction, there were rapid facts to create, while the country lacked the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief business leader of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing at the country business mobility, only 29 jobs have been established.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
The CDU Group View Christian Baldauf refers to estimates by the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the acquisition of country streets.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country to address the lack of expertise in the region.
In addition to the previous broadband development in the country, it is important.
In 2016 regional companies assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They complain about stocking internet connections and abuses.
In contrast, former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Board of Supervisors of the Wind Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to be president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where they had already re-examined the field after four months of inconsistencies.
Audi is supposed to change the self-assessment tools - auto manufacturers are faced with a counter-reaction
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would be offered to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company would be of the opinion that "the smarter options are as restrictive as traffic" and that it was in European cities - including Munich, where BMW is available - to prohibit or restrict auto vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of self-propelled vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered as carcinogens and may cause Asthma.
The cost of the car manufacturers to install installations for the neutralisation of the exhaust emissions from self-propelled vehicles is also difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of neglecting the powerful auto companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the error of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called exhaust devices, to comply with the rules when a car is tested, but to return to normal conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of vans, others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be brought before the U.S. court.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at the Volkswagens, after the Audi authorities accused them of installing a system to implement the emission regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation may be difficult for Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer is over-proportionally contributing to the win of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on Isar
The city wants to protect the Isir.
In order to join the Isar visitors, on the dark Saturday, a river flows through Munich, which has a special message.
As it draws again to the Isar on Saturday, there will be a great fleet between the fleets and the raindrops.
And that's not a common fleet with Isar tourists.
But he wants to clear the baureferat.
On the river you see a great infotransparent.
It shows a müllberg.
The invitation to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love is...", the understanding of the Isir is to strengthen as a valuable forest flood.
In the last summer, the fleet over Isar and also in this year, there are further actions and measures to achieve a more considerate and environmentally sensitive behaviour.
Mordilless Knollennasen and the Laughing Against Suffering
Mordillo was currently one of the most published cartoon characters, the knollennas of his figures are his brands.
With 85, the Argentina is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laken, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he fought, among other things, as a painter for luck cards - what frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my career was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60th anniversary of the collapse: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stars" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist of cities is always reading again.
Large, round Mordillo figurines meet in drawings with the ship Turm of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the red spot in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still in the drawing room, working nearly ten hours a day.
Over the calendar, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, platoons and watches, his dark figures continue to find a lot of worldwide expansion.
For six years he has also worked on a sign print film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' favorite animal in its drawings - which has a thousand fans as a opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is intended to come to the quinoleinwald in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're saying, it's rare for me," says Mordillo.
The scroll is not written by him.
That is why he puts more emphasis on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced in vain.
Lavender from the Provence from the Climate Change
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South Africa, but there is a warning that he is threatened by the climate change.
The Lavender is slowing down because of the conditions at door and because of the diseases transmitted insects, what scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, prepares great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPAPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The Lavender in the Provence has been effectively threatened because plants have been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of Lavendell.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits the zorgzikad, and there are many of them in very dry weather."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts passengers, it is also asked very much for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant life with a large number of flowers, we have less, less developed and both lacking or weak.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions that are taken into account include a better distribution of water and the slowing down of the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of ton and water and the development of species that are resistant to dryness.
The city of Geisa in the Tyrian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
The summit is this Saturday and Sunday with a mid-term festival.
Kramers, cemeteries, dealers, vagants or a farmer should be able to experience these days in the city.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce will normally meet during the week to check their plans for reporting on the latest Chaos in Sinaloa State through organized crime, corrupt officials and unsolicited drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are going to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front page of the room: counter, neutral, connected.
They ask the rapporteur to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, no reservations and feelings are enough.
There are drug dealers, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals who endanger Mexico's Chaos.
There is no break from violence, and as the bodies spread throughout the country, there are still more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken his office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and strikes under federal protection, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and inspiration from Riodace, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in a book on violence in relation to drugs.
His shortcomings will be deeply resolved, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the fascade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bring T-shirts, which show his casual face with glasses or his typical panamaut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their alpine dreams, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special federal government was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has introduced only two criminal procedures to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As in most thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought before court.
At Riodoce they still have to deal with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are desperate and although the earth is still more fragile.
Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all miss."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corrolla was held by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The guard walked into his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two grown children.
I'm afraid I'm going to go back to Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing like Sweiking.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest fighting camps in the country since rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't seem that in Sinaloa someone or more people will be shot on the street every day or that the hall is full of abandoned, double-sized furniture for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
For a minute, remember that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coast with its valuable ports and drug dealers in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodace, was guilty of breaking up his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the revaliating cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons was published.
This publication may have disappointed the sons, suspected gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skiers.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own safety after the decision of another newspaper published in the same history.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues believed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroest in 2003 when he sold himself together with five colleagues to establish Riodace and 50 US dollars in shares.
In Sinaloa, "that it is impossible to exercise journalism without stopping the issue of emission allowance," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper deserved a call because of the bold and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising took place.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard research without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else would want to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodace, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for His Courage in the Persecution of Mexican Drug History, where she was always led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ drawing.
In Sinaloa's drug trade "is a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"They must take the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the drums.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done so many deaths ... why didn't you tell me what happened before?"
The Riodace team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could run like a port worker, the friend who was a great-grandfather with hugs and kisses, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his loss?
His death also forced her to ask her own opinions about how she could best do her job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you work with your wife, your children, their clean business, their secret start and land trips", to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-sustainment and self-sustainment.
Trust his own instincts.
If it's wrong, stay away from it.
The judge is, the publisher of Riodace Andres Villarreal said, "By means of a sense that can be tasted ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - not so much as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, where a toxic mix of luxury wedding routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce's employees were confronted with security training, no phones were immediately allowed. Days before it was announced that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Riodace in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
In the meantime, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers who were called the Governor himself and who were not trusted.
It's been months since the reporters went to Bergland, where the drug gangs de facto are under control.
For the issue this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julius Caesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state expenditure that focused on the city of the Governor.
And there was a group that carried out a tour in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the State Health Service.
There was no official word about who was executed or how it happened, so it was warned when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter reported on public records that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Several PRI Governors were recently charged with high-ranking cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman experienced a military defeat.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the columns of Valdez as the best information source on the output.
"We had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his fragile body structure.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage space for characters and clothingers who protest against the murder of journalists because the staff have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez broke down a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the government's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burning body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests, it was his.
All over the country, journalists have become more louder by signing in organized protests "SOS Press" on weights and buildings.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and leaving them behind because they had told the truth.
She has prayed to be re-divided from the government because she is concerned that her mind has damaged her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico have been "given" by organised crime, by government officials involved and by a similar society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that not only were reporters killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime under a blanket.
The media group "Artique 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Apparently the killers have an amazing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note, which was apparently signed by the Zetas Charter: "I am here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their detached head.
Some branches have chosen to close the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed public to the drug cartel with a leading article on the title with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from their country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are happy, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risk decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a closer first, said that the drug trade had robbed him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
For midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce went to the town hall before the office and drank beer when they started to sum up all their phones.
There were 19 confirmed deaths in a series of shootings with banded rivals and security forces near the Badeorte Mazatlan.
The war continued, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the side of the board, they have published the news on the website of Rioduce on the phone.
The title had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were nearby - another shiper in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the powerful portrait of the famous founder of the newspaper whose medium finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the staff of Riodace followed his footsteps.
"How can you just think about it," Bojorquez said, "when the same day the Javier was murdered, the practitioners asked me to send them to report on the street."
Dinosaurium used to wash his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, even an amazing one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian mountain worker's incredible nashor were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even determine that his beautiful skin was red brown - and they said that she had something of a "unblemished past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosauri who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the credit period.
Its incredible well-being has been described by researchers who describe it as "real remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the planted plant freshery is the best fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millionium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that was missing from the surrounding stone, and decided to look more closely at it.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years trying to discover the animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of hard soil.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be realized.
"If you were to blink just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was asleep," said the main author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and bestly obtained dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant cooler, although it is covered with a solution and looks like a changing panzer, is likely threatened by meat-fresh dinosaurs.
The heavily-pained dinosaur used a red and white to hide from predators, and used a screening technique known as anti-fraud, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing in his environment and removing his enemies, experts say what means that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature of the Nodosauri family has made its first battle line in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it has named Boraleopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoes and ties over his body.
They discovered the counter-chatting, a widespread animal defense method, which means that the tops of the creation were darker than their subside.
Although counter-chatting is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Boraleopelta exceeds the size of the animals that live today.
It indicates that the dinosaur has been driven by sufficient pressure by a meat-producing dinosaur that Evolution has benefited from the distortion of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use the counter-chatting - you think of rabies, Zebras or chicken animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which signaled that this nodosaur was a real fight for survival.
"Stark animal behaviours on a massive, strong-panned dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the credit period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of its life, including its preserved darmin content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and moved to the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more landside than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable, because it is fully covered with preserved sweet skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly today as in the early credit period.
You don't need a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you just shoot a little with your eyes, you can almost believe he's asleep."
The Creed time was a time, like a massive thermopods, flexible dinosaurs that stood on two legs, crossing the earth.
Although the king of them, who lived in Tirannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Boraelopelta, had been driven by some of his strange practices.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, consists of six tons of heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appeared in current biology magazine, believe that Boraleopelta was humiliated after death in the sea and mutated in the mud.
The creation was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-kept dinosaur, including skin and rest, and is completely from the snow to the spring.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It consisted of two 20-inch spikes that were made of his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the frozen plant freshness was frozen by western Canada until a river flowed into the open sea.
But the water supply of the dinosaurs preserved its rest in exotic detail.
The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well received that the hairdryers still cover half-pound panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it is such a level of maintenance as rarely as a profit in Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it will be.
The hidden remains of the skin still cover the delicate panzer plates that bear the damage of the animal.
His right forward foot is on his side, his five fingers are drawn up.
I can count the shoes on his shoulder.
In the white: mass caramelage on A8: Many injuries
A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are developed in a mass car park.
There are a number of injuries, hundreds of miles of staus and gaffes.
On the highway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured during a mass car accident on Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's first statement, at 1700 hours between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) there were approximately 30 vehicles, including probably also trucks.
At first, the exact number of victims did not provide any information.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, a police speaker said.
A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 direction was completely blocked.
In the direction of the München train, about 10 kilometers long back was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there have also been massive obstacles on the road - through numerous strikes.
The fire-fighting took note of the signs of the vehicle chain that now have to deal with sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a pkw.
A rescue bomber was on the way to the crash site.
Deutsche Path: Group Tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: Nothing else sits in the train and sleeps.
Or you're deep in your work and just have a wonderful thought.
And then: puff.
The climber comes and wakes up a mess or lifts the ride from the center of workflow.
Driver's card.
But the time of interruptions is soon over.
The German Bahn is currently testing the wireless driving cards.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and evaluate the road map.
A test operation is currently running on two tracks.
"The offer comes, we know it.
It will then be likely to be available in many other areas of transport in Germany in the coming years," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train's rating without a driver's license.
However, certain conditions must be met: a smartphone or a tablet is needed.
And you've got to book an online ticket - whatever most passengers already do.
It also needs to be applied to the app of the train that has bought the DB Navigator, which is also the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works as follows: You stand in the train, call your car card under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic design appears in the test customers.
The trainers have a notification on their mobile devices that the X passenger is in the train and has taken the Y seated seat.
The trainer comes with the driver's license at Y's place to know that there is a passenger with an already-designed online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, you can work, you can move on.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - what to use the passengers again.
"If you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This enables the passengers to plan their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, president of DB Television.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to meet the individual customer needs."
Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the driving licences are among the biggest concerns.
Because you often have yourself, but one of the mystery messengers does not have all the details you need to review online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personal form or another document you need to present is missing.
The consequences are endless discussions between trainers and passengers, leading to a bad vote in the section or large space and delays in checking their own ticket and taking time to take care of other cases at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this is also only on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stutgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further numbers on the same line are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot down to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, in St. Louis, where she was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scored by Facebook on her phone.
She was proud of a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's still on the street," he said.
Disturbed that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed her Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handy @TheePharoh has been constantly promoted on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., alive to second.
He posted a picture of Brown's leblosm body that was stretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She left her phone to return to Twitter later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who took a sword with the inscription: "The police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live food, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a strange dog.
In another video, she said, "I'll kill all animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to call us typical."
At this moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and angry."
She bought a return flight and went home the next day.
After the earthquake about 23 hours, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas since 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, the strength and resistance of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.
As Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, both discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “over the black experience and the black condition”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for it, where they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not true.
I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
You need to know it and see it and get caught up in it.
It must be well developed, not only by activity and organization, but also by knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the joy of giving you an experience in which she personally does not experience eclecting racism, she is no different than the next black woman's child.
I have the feeling that I would show you a bad service to keep them away from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first station was located at the South Florissant Road, a place against the police authorities that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible false charges.
There Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new type of activity for Ferrell began to be adopted.
"My activity has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
A week later Ferrrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-regists of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell: "Would you document or try to find a story that could benefit you?"
This creature was consumed by numerous cases of humans, often by white - in a community that benefited from its pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not focus their voices and we wanted to do otherwise."
Folayan had already worked with co-regist Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activity around death extracts.
His commitment brought Ferrrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrall's experience - to show that it was "not for a Messiah leader, but for a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the open-ended actor of the film.
Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" show amazing personal aspects of Ferrell's life how she loves and marries her wife.
"I felt as naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some harm in this work and in the humanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history continues to play the role of black school women in the wider black-lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three causes of the movement, which after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have led to the film "BlacklivesMutter" in social media, are identified as a school.
"Black, weak women in leadership positions have brought the movement together," said Ferrrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, weak women have to carry the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement will really be maintained by black women and many black women".
It is, however, that "this is no confirmatory type of action", in the railway because of its identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who gave up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was on the front front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, thin woman is so much on the game.
You can breathe their energy through the screen."
The news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on assessment for 211⁄2 years due to the blockade of a car at a demonstration.
She describes the social political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Yet, she smiles at a song and feels obliged to think of it since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "traum" to "size car": Talk TV readers about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it's not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center in the south of the footing zone has been spreading the population as early as the first presentation in 2009.
It's cold. It's almost a matter of time.
The subject will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg".
While they say to a bit gallery: "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be a real class" (Nicole Shousten), it comes from the other side: "No man needs" (Siggi Betten) or totally evil: "Groan car!" (Lars Scholz).
While the sponsors build that a gallery has more customers in the city, which also benefits other businesses, the opponents fear that then the footing zone will collapse.
In addition, the gallery is located on the ground floor on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.
Galerie Makers want to integrate a market hall into the Neubau - and even to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We've been buying almost weekly in the Farm Market Hall for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cooks of the rural women are still very much in love.
We've also discovered the matchmaker for us.
We would like to have a chance to receive this offer directly during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, that is also true.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If the direct market is located in a market hall in the gallery, the rent will rise.
The new project should not be very low."
Eva Kilic: "Wozu shopping mall in Bitburg?
Whether in clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find the excess.
There's enough of that in our city.
However, you can see how many loading businesses are empty here - some months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is so important that at least we still have the market hall.
Because the product offered there is always fresh, most of it is offered directly by the manufacturer and is uniquely priced.
As you can see, in a shopping center, cargo shops are only rented by larger companies, because the rent there is often not available for a retailer.
Unfortunately, there's hardly any more special business and what's left of it will probably be gone."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall is not suitable for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm market hall go during the construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time if the bit gallery is ever to come.
Or has it already created the Bit-Gallery Gespenst to move all business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And a shopping center, which is empty, doesn't need anyone.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a fair farming market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, there is no place in Bitburg because of the huge number - as I find - of mindless construction projects.
When the farmer market hall is seized, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of Friedman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost identical - which depend on cables from the deck.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wagen-Tupfers and hair cuts that were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the extracts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former Secret Service Analyticist spent a 35-year prison sentence after making it a secret diplomatic announcement on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Coming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg, whose discipline combines its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfranch and dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was changed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from 30 portraits, how someone might look with these genetic data, even though some intellectual comment is not only about the formativity of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determination of these interpretations - but also about identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been speaking openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges, including six infringements against spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was crushed, so much so that it only gave a single photo - a simple, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is clearly sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platinum-blond leather - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Strigger Visions'.
In it, artists produced portraits of foreigners from federal artifacts such as cigarettes and rubber, by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press release of the new exhibition.
And she could not visit at this time and could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and their museums were inseparable fellows who replaced several letters over two years.
They even create a comic "Suppressed Images" that would change the future in which President Chelseas would turn judgment and they would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, only a few days after the book was published would require Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, it was a kind of happy meeting.
At the opening of the exhibition, there is also something deep and strong, as Donald Trump is leading a war on informants from the government camp and against transgender groups to find new, two-way ways to expand the bigger columns that he should actually control.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said, "It happens for a certain reason."
In a artistic speech written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked for its greatest signature (the "i" in her family name is seen with a heart) an end to the "automatic dispersion which has been based on sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand sensors of Cs and Gs and As, written in bleistift.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by adding the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to do is that our name is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how they are subjective," said Dewey Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are. "
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the comic novels mentioned above.
It shows Manning how she appeared with a free phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary cassettes like King-King.
"If they call you, they won," it says.
"So never stop the mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who cried out from Philadelphia.
"I'll still get gensy when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it is expected in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genome simulations, which combine itself as a host of protestors.
This was also targeted, as was all in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2" 2 Mannings statue), where their genetic haplo groups were written with bleistif.
"In the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a lot of people," said Dewey Hagborg from the portrait.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that came after her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder
A country-wide student is currently in charge of a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who was suspected of being injured after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the documents of Cook County court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several strokes.
A community alarm system published by the Chicago police authorities ordered the body to be discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still on the scene of the event for dot, and detectives were investigating the strike as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an outstanding professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now in place and has been excluded from membership of the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasurer Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US intelligence authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen them," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a six-way tip, who claimed that there was something happening in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very rude.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time and background of the victim and investigating a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA driving plan in the near future" - the Russian vice-president Mutko
The Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are applied for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA driving plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap on compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the re-installation of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he doesn't have anything that could give Russia an opportunity to take care.
"All has been announced, everything will be applied.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-Doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian Legal Officer Richard McLaren on Stately promoted doping in Russian sport.
In connection with the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-Doping system has encountered an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we're not going to give something that doesn't exist."
Mutkos' words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.
In a discussion with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-Doping organisations, adding: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one has any intention of accepting this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Doping scandal by WADA from the conduct of Doping Controls in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA "in the right direction" is moving to be used again.
Already no longer sells one's eggs
This was shared by the business groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure, which could no longer be excluded from any health threat, and it was contained in the communication.
From now on only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which must have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti solution.
Aldi wants to produce clarity and transparency in his customers.
The start-up that will help your company not become the next uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees at your e-Commerce-Start-up, but the questions did not work.
Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - negative.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers do not fail the process.
"It simply did not give consistency and objectivity," said Erret, who owned the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She called people outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By setting up and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it allows companies to carry out surveys, to contact specific groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymous and complaint hotlines, and in some cases to allow them to turn C-Suite driving forces directly to the Governing Council.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software Analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Erret said she had a better perspective on what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap questionnaires and questionnaires of certain teams, it offers a hit-card of the company which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which driving forces have low-performance results - so that you can see why.
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture, so that you will not become the next Uber developed in scandal, since a former employee has published a blog post, which describes a range of sanctions, in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire is, after a glance, a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could possess more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up convergence, helps companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber fall in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber just signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send moderated "pulls-" queries, collect reliable answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem environment.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the main business manager is involved, complaints will go directly to the Board of Supervisors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has taken note of the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and business leader of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treated badly or to be treated indiscriminately, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-kitte with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate centre.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an insult and inconceivable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said that there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company uses the Convercent, problems that may have been identified and addressed before the leadership forces placed in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, fine-tuning or unfavourable practices - can be identified and addressed faster.
"I can get closer to this whole, 360 degree look into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who led the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
The company began to take on the role of ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the bookkeeping firm Arthur Andersen compiled for ethical damage caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it lasted until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing went online.
"For the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have both started-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with the total capital increased to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November of Bestemer Venture partners and contributed its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complexity of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high levels of content and interesting projects are only fittings.
The staff members want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Context and Glint.
Employees achieve income when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
If the Analytics tools third parties promise to increase the commitment and use of employees, it is not surprising that you find support.
The data on the employee's commitment are important to the experts of the workplace culture.
However, the data are used when no action is taken by the administrator of a company.
In fact, if a company asks a employee for your feedback, it may be expected that the change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can slow down and demolize employees.
"If you ask 4,000 claims, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, the company that has seen too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you worried about that?
And who don't you worry about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff inquiries, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint.
And after collecting fedbacks from frustrated staff, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company has always received new insights about employees, and it is hoped that in a long term, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes at 23 hours when a number of UCLA football players are held on one side of the new team training field on the campus.
Some have removed their tricotobytes and show the back full of Switzerland from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their finals after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"That's for the boys the next three days a real trick," said Brians-trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the player's load, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the end of the day.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19:15 a.m. to correct the time schedules already filled by the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six games in Westwood.
They are supposed to stop training during August 18. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their appointment against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's regime, even if it added another point to the many busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on her for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just put it through, they stick on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished, which, in view of the clear views of its field of a adjacent park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been built with football, which has been damaged by a protective network behind a torpfoot, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to own the hotel this week, but Mora agreed that it could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We're going to put our security in place," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not too late to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video band from an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at park 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I don't care much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify action checks in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact-checkers of third parties and then show their results under the original entry, the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called Fake news.
In an opinion on his website, the company said that it would start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers, which might show the results of the actual verification from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for Fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US Presidency elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where French voters were transferred in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they are not able to eliminate hot spots such as before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to Germany that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge that stories from fact-checking third parties will be started, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "linked article" and work on other changes in its message feed to reduce incorrect messages.
Create a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his younger years, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Scottish music video and was a club hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived for 700 years in Turbulent History of his comfortable seat in Bewl River Tal in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says quietly.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland. Every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Death Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I have only responded to the impression on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobs," he says.
"It's his toothbrush!
And letters always flow to smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the spirit has an effect as if he were himself.
Oh, I love Archive!"
For someone who has been hit with such old papers that he is supported by National Trust and Arts Council England and has lived for almost four months in a lock ("To be honest: I have a little overestimated my welcome") this seems to be too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days investigating the Victorian "new" lock to view the archive and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the lock, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in graveyards.
He traveled through the land and the ruins of the old town and spoke to farmers, gardeners and sometimes even artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to care for the archive, which he described as "hundred of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, it's on the roofs".
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps, which represent who said: "I could think that conflicts would be long-term," says Rhodes, "but there was a bickery to fight the two families.
Boy, let's get him out of here!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the borough as the starting point to exchange more widely in English history, including 'The Laborer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built borough to join the construction stage of 1381.
"There is a record of a survey of 1380 in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The construction of this area began, and I thought it was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are recorded in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patriarch who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which Schmuggler Arthur Darrell is represented in the 18th century, who insinuated his own preparation by filling a sarge with stones (a discovery made one year later when his sarge was excavated).
The Darrells are the Rhodes'Love family of Scotney: "The Lords seem to be quite happy, always make mistakes and spend money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying many old women - I think they're a very good boy to me, with a talent to buy connections."
After the end of its use in the closure, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He took a two-week stay in the Finnish Wildness for a comic novel about Eljemänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was both demanded by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish my fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Mariencapelle in Rhöndorf
With the cancellation of the 301-year-old Mariencapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (rundsview of Donnerstag).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, the campaign was to give a party on the island of Graphenwerth.
"You'll be nice to us.
Or," asked the actors of the action yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapelle.
"We don't think of it (of course!)" they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that something is better than it seems.
On the basis, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than a "only" logo and a slogan, it means more.
"It is appropriate to form an independent agreement, one that gives the city an irreplaceable unique feature."
Finally, they are in competition with other communities.
The town of Bad Honnef has a medium fifth amount to cost its new roofmarks and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year, August starts in Ankara of the Supreme Military Department (YAS) about pensions and transports in the official body.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish fighting forces a year after the bombing.
The meeting was no longer in the building of the General Staff as before, but at the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
That's why the civilians in YAS were in excess.
The government takes the wheel in the military.
President Hulusi Akar remains at the office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the sea have been removed.
Since the failed coup, State Chief Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exil Prediger Fethulah Gulen, the Erdogan as the driver of the dust test.
Against 486 persons who should have been directly involved in the Putsch test will be treated in Ankara this week.
By the day after the Putsch, Erdogan had called the conversion test "good gift" because he had given him the opportunity to "cleanse the fighting forces completely".
But Erdogan really has the army in the grip?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Insatisfaction in the Military headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is shown among other things in the lifting of the ban on soldiers.
The major cleansing of the army and the security forces continues anyway.
In the middle of July, Erdogan fired 7395 State officials, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had captured the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real rulers of the country.
Three times they played their role as guardians of the World State Order.
Following its 2002 election, Erdogan stressed the power of military action to step up, not least in line with the reform objectives of the European Union.
Former officials say that Erdogan is trying to achieve an Islamicization of the fighting forces.
In the magazine 'Vocal Europe', a so-called non-commissioned officer who, after the Putschschsch test from fear of persecution in the country of Asyl, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that were to happen, such a development could not let the Nato cold.
In addition, there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army to join the Alliance.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weak", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He plans to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter requirements for the acquisition of Visa for an extended work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation should be discussed in the two Chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to clear tracks for racetracks
In the past months, the future of the race race was always fought again - now it is going to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is to be built on the maroon road on which the tourist road runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race track, construction work should begin on the road, as stated by the Ministry of Transport in this year.
"With the decision to continue to order and heal the street of Ilmenau race, the country is known to this country, especially for the important connection to tourism," said Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of setting up the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country took 75 percent.
The contract, which is to be ordered by the Shuttle in the future of the country, will now be finally agreed, shall be declared.
The Ministry and the South Tyringen Bahn as an operator have already been very specific about the technical details.
"That's why the vehicle plan is used and the quality standards are dealt with," said Soul.
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
In December 2017, the Runnsteig-Shuttle is to be ordered regularly.
The Rinnsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rinnsteig railway ports.
In the past months, a pilot has been tested whether the route of many people is used to order them regularly in the future.
In addition, the track is highly permanent in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you think it can't be crazy 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming up.
Yes, really.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artistic intelligence at the University of Sheffield and FRR's co-founders, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eye, its shape of chestnuts and the type of fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver every amount of them, and we will see them even more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern sex puppies have developed from their flashy partners to robots with a siliconhound that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust his robot" according to his beliefs and then choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the brush to the type or color of his fingernail.
But it will be even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would gradually make a stepford woman look.
Modern sex pumps have developed into robots with a silicone.
The RealBotix Robots enables, for example, its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they encounter, for example, protection.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Robots developed by True Company with preprogrammed personalities such as "Freeid Farrah", which communicates the impression of privacy and "Wild Wendy" with a "abortive" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality," the website of True Company says.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has their voices during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be "in a vote"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise in sex robots - not the latter, because they replace real human relationships - but the undermining female qualities, the games of violence, if you take a step on Frigid (here is: opposite) Farrah, one of the most alarming.
On his website, True Company Roxxxy compares to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a roxxy?" it is on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.
Their appearance and their increasing refining reflect something darker and deeper in our culture, a return from the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional assignment.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the edge of consumer culture.
But what comes through the ranges can be very learned about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not rare or attractive until the free market permits them to do so.
There is, however, a certain overlap between these highly developed sex robots in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has spoken about sexual assault on women.
The most shocking aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic pictures, the broken bodies and the eyes that are scattered, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a spring, but at the moment it does not feel like a great spring.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar ratios).
Their designer wants them to feel humanly that they are following the movement of a real body.
But, at the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.
They have no intelligence or background history, nothing that means independence or something that could interfere with the idea of total subversion.
Other expressed: They are delicious slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Servicegirls
Are you having a great performance?
He makes me with Romney to understand the healthy human mind
It has become evident to a considerable extent that the political divisions that have polarized the US election have also broken families into smaller forms.
About Christmas and Easter, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the Horror of Trump.
We're all supposed to put our filters in place.
It is less noted that the power to bring together Trumps, families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed Dieter who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trup in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relations she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and entirely owned on the same side.
For lunch it must be a good thing, but it seems to me in another context that this also poses serious risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the creative effect of his presidency has the power to shoot us all to the right.
If we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the enormous possibility that we will no longer be deprived of the tastes of a day.
However, there is a more disturbing long-term scenario, in which the Republicans of the right fly "normalized", which suddenly appear as an inconsistencies in comparison to its standards.
Today, I find myself in an active nostalgia for mid-Romany's urcomic version of the crazy one - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in comparison to Trump, are actually a very mild punishment.
If Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an indispensable improvement.
As my cousins were in the city, we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York parking lot, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are brief and the animals are trying to see their own shoulders full of fear - especially windows and the air-conditioning music convey this in a remarkable way.
So many clicks of a city: The views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Fifty years later, and I am still not quite sure about the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pubu Ye Old Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circle traffic in northern London.
However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a rare magical experience, since there are two years of age, an 11-year-old and two-year-old women in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the Karussell, I would have given him the full number, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a shopping house to assess my " Experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop.
This leads not only to a desire to what should be a neutral exchange, but also to pressure the server to put personality into a situation that is not necessary.
The poor woman in the house of purchase was extremely critical, while I had the experience to reach her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison in the hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit the second time.
In the past year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hands, which he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned for murder after an appeal by the state prosecutor against a first death sentence.
He killed Steinkamp in early mornings of the Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her through a bathroom door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his friend for a night's end, who hid in the cabin.
The state officials have announced their intention this time to condemn the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Procedure Authority said that they would be sued at the Supreme Court of South Africa and could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased for 15 years if the state officials are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a remarkable egg
As the last of the Bloomberg schools, the four clasps were released from foot-and-mouths in the holidays and in the continuing schools.
Three of the graduating students will go to Gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
Schoolmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the town hall Biessental in Epfenhofen on the day of service.
As a symbol of the school's graduation, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Queen Meder, chose a young adult who grows up in the hall, but will then be released into freedom.
In addition, the Mount Schar introduced a musical entitled "The Adler in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a remarkable egg, and he let it explode from his knees.
Instead of a hive, a little Adler came out.
But the hope of making a nest out of him fell, and the Adler spread his wings over a high mountain.
The classes then showed three and four in the Yvonne Frank's study a stage dance.
The girls danced with the young gocks who wear zylinders for the weather.
The Adler is responsible for the integration, said schoolmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal, however, is different from the other young animals (kikes), but it is.
But he won't be like a wolf.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every quarter-classer to feel accepted in her new school.
Thank you, Mr Müller, to the colleagues, former school leader Michael Müller, who is always in the process of re-training, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen was now over, declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of training, she left her students very poor because it was a really great time.
Finally, they could have left themselves on the four clasps.
Finally, all the students were allowed to hear a song of summer time and holiday time.
It brought great joy to the children.
For the new school year, eight first clauses have been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested because of illegal campsites in Greece, shared with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by the TV.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal thieves were arrested by the police in Sidonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released, while an investigation was under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over the free Campen and impose substantial penalties on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls are continued throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could reduce a fine.
Software updates for diesel vehicles: What the people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers be involved in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At Diesel Gipple, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group software updates have been offered for around 5.3 million cars.
They should improve the behaviour of cars of the Emission Class Euro 5 and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro-4 pieces or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe offers reviews:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the processed software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates are only applicable to vehicles having shower software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their refurbishment has been organised by the KBA.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a slow implementation in the coming months, but no specific deadline has yet been specified.
Daimler told me to sign up for every person concerned.
If an inspection fails, it will be carried out within its scope.
How long should the equipment be drawn together?
"It's hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the manufacturer's commitment and political pressure.
"Because we have seen the car manufacturers act voluntarily on the subject of the environment not long ago."
How long should the update last?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more timer to get a deadline.
What do car drivers not drive from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group do?
The ACE is ready to wait.
It is possible that foreign producers would be attracted, such as Smetanin.
Is there now a massive drop in prices from Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But even in the regions where driving bans take place.
In rural space, there are no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE is ready to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center drawing
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first price award under President Trump is promised to become political.
One of the priests doesn't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The nominations will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will be hosted a reception and will participate with his wife Melania in the event of his resignation.
The prestigious Lear, known for its progressive TV series, has already announced that he would refuse to participate in the Gala.
The New York Times said: "This Presidency has decided to fully undermine the arts and human rights - even withdrawing them - and that imposes on me."
The 59-year-old Stefan stressed that they would use the talk with Trump to clarify their views.
The Kennedy center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the United States capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, is going to rent next year.
The place is already written - suitable applicants are, however, rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a mayor of the city.
And the work continues to make him happy as he communicates in the press.
He reports about variety, but also demands tasks that are expected of his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application will meet the requirement profile until the application has been made.
The city is looking for a architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
This should be - given the regular deadlines - enough time for employment.
As Haslach works for the administrative community as a subsidiary of the construction authority, the applicant must provide the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer meet these requirements, the citizens would have to run for advice until after Offenburg.
But citizens are close to the city and it is important to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good business environment and good voice between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years at the office, some important projects have been collected, focusing on the Wacker with steel.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building and its staff.
But in the future, however, there are varied projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Netherlands park have been under attack.
The King's bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach will be renewed, as well as the seasonalization is still the subject.
Only the last one will be hit with about 1.5 million euros in book, "if we do it right", says Wacker.
"All of us are waiting for great tasks on my followers.
The work here is fun."
For a city builder there is a large playroom.
With Haslach's own building and garden could be reacted directly to many.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the plant will often be praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city stands as an assembly of memorials, it is important to have a "eye for what is clean" when new buildings are approved, the different building houses stress.
Despite this, the mayor has a high responsibility.
He's a farmer, "At the end, everything is running over my table."
He can count on long-term employees: Markus Neuumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes to say, "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good business environment but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to rob Roland Wacker should be able to present an completed study as a diplomat or Bachelor with noticeable architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction law.
The city building is supported by high- and deep construction, construction planning, basic business affairs, city property management, city office with building and city administration, as well as under construction law, including memory protection.
Motorcycle fired on directions: South track closed
According to the police, the unknown performers had fired the blue bike from the railway operation in the area of Leobener Street (B116).
They were so badly damaged that they had to be treated as a result of the incineration of goods.
The detectors go out of two men's bodies and search for them from the hours of the night.
Close to the tatort, Witnesses were observed as a rosary roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a noisebubbing stream," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
He or she had taken great risks and also threatened traffic.
In addition to the damage to the lock and installation and the late minutes and costs for rail transport, train customers may also be able to reach the targets.
Totally be out of a "great" sum, the speaker said.
The damages were again necessary on Friday afternoon, which could be carried on the road along the south road without obstacles.
Nearly ten persons were missing on Friday morning, two of them were on the road.
Good things don't work out, but they're late.
According to ÖBB speecher Christoph Posch, about 200 meters had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also injured.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alpha.
But a new study claims that the opposite is true: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products may improve the symptoms of patients with intestinal diseases.
The unhappy state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach attacks and blasts, recurring or bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the concerned are normally asked to eat meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acids of proteins contribute to the development of immunosuppressive cells that promote a tolerant darm.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the dark to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of eliminating divergences are likened to cells that promote tolerance and protect the body from harming without sensitive tissue.
If the balance decreases too far in the direction of dispersion, this can result in a heart attack.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-producing immunosuppression occurs in mice that carry a particular bacteria into their tissues.
And the bacteria need Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to release the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuter - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Triptophan had the museums in their food, the more they had these immunities."
He suggested that the combination of L. Reuters and a rich food on Tryptophan encourage tolerance, less sensitive dry air if the same system also works in humans.
The post-doctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune system that encouraged tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribes that had been subjected separately did not.
She suggested that the difference between the darm microbiomas of the museum - the community of bacteria, viruses and Pilzens, who normally live in the magen-darms.
The bones of the museums were DNA sequenced and six bacteria were found that were present in the museums with the immune cells, but they were missing in the museums.
Mouses were taken into a sterile environment, so they lacked a darm microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuter and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuters grew in a fluidity and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to unusual immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance cells.
When the active components have been cleaned from fluid, it is proved to be an additional product of Tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3-Mic acid.
If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food of the museum, the number of such cells increases by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values are broken, the number of cells around half will fall.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuters protect in our magnets.
It is not known whether triptophan-neglected products from L. reuters develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in humans with mental impairment.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control radiation on the inner surface of the Darms.
Potentially, high triptophan values in the presence of L. Reuters can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United has signed a "genie" with Nemanja Matic, Joseph Mourinho believes, after the middle-class player had his debut against Samdoria.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and was impressed by the role of the holder, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira took the lead.
Matt, however, was excluded from the preparation Asian tour of the blues and only 45 minutes were created, which Mourinho indicated that he had to improve before the beginning of the League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Mattic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his starting-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent concluded this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already had a "funtastic work" to meet three of its four priorities.
"Three of four, I thank the Union for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four for me, but they've given me great pleasure."
Boeing "old" dreamline in heaven
The US air carrier Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle to Washington, U.S. state, but the drawing started in March in Michigan, U.S. state, and came in the form of a dreamliner over the United States, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screen was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an extension test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such a statement before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
As the wind turns, as Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, social democratic presidents always looked at elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
Not only did no fires from the party headquarters, only no resistance from the feds - so the most important desire of the electorate was expressed.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed substantially.
Since then, workers from the Willy-Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-regulated capital cities.
What has been gained from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the form of wind.
It was deep cracks.
And one after the other.
The Bundes-CDU, after the surprise end of the red-green majority in the Netherlands, sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once more: Red Green can't easily manage," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editing network (RND).
The surprising division of a Green Abdominant group has hit the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.
Five months before the country elections, he lost his red-green coalition so that their majority vote against the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Bundescher, Michael Kellner, has asked the Dutch Green Aborigines every Tuesday to return their mandate.
The transition to CDU means a clear violation of the electoral will.
Every tweet must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Business Leader and the Greens' electoral leaders to the Editing Network Germany (RND).
"That can't be true," said a SPD-elector, as the new Job message reached the party centre on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is following the transfer of the Green Chambers to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional height of a whole range of major and small crises in SPD-country associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The measurements began with the unexpected significant decline in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the joys rested in his time.
After the day-to-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
This has also become - and although everything has become much worse.
The landings in Kiel brought the SPD into Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-pleite haute around the party.
Mühsam called again during the week.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20-Gifle of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the most powerful SPD Head of the country, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he entered Elbphilharmony while burning his city.
And because he made so many mistakes in the crisis communication that you can make a mistake.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW waste and its role in the supervisory board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in the crisis for a long time.
My husband's infraggerated came in.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because, in the past few weeks, he has tried to put more emphasis on the federal accent.
The intention of the former mayor of Hannover to build his power in Berlin was also not hidden by his friends in the area of Martin Schulz.
They left him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
This is because there is no blame on the part of the Dutch Greens on the ground.
And the shield is not yet.
In many ways, the people are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her throne is on the greens, and here, above all, on the detachable Parliamentary Vice-President of the Council.
"It is inextricably and democratically damaging, as Mrs. Twesten put her own career interests in the interests of others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Links in the SPD-Bundedags Group, the German Network (RND).
Ms Twesten is not chosen for her person as a direct candidate, but for the country list of Dutch reasons in Parliament, so the Dutch Members continue.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Bundesags Group, regrets a "undemocratic manover".
"The electoral will was clear four years ago: The people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," said Oppermann, who led the Dutch SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU defileter brings to light the election result," said Oppermann.
He asked to explain the background.
I want to know whether there have been more or there have been further reports from the CDU Lower Saxons.
Loans for local screens III
Anyone who wants to heal his home in the years can first receive support from the country.
In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG's city development on Wednesday in Empingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again took a look at the previous incident.
Since 1991 it has been available in sensitive areas of sanitation.
At the time, the Baden-Württemberg country had received two thirds of the aid sum from 1991 to 2004.
In the area of Sanctions II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 per cent.
For Schindler, previous sanitation is a success project - it is essential to promote internal development, and not only to create new areas of construction.
On April 4th, Karlsruhe received information from the government's Bureau that a zone III will be provided.
The aid amount is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest of the Community.
How does a sanitation area come into existence?
You will continue to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in solving whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If so, the boundaries of the area may then be re-examined.
The STEG is represented by medium-sized Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gottzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal country programme "Social City", which would then carry out the screenings.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented on the basis of the objective.
Finally, the Sanctions Area would be established as a settlement.
The period of authorisation for the aid shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year would be carried out only once, in the framework of those involved in the treatment area, a questionnaire would be completed.
In November or December, the adoption decision should be made as soon as possible in order to begin with the sanctions in the coming year.
Pietzschmann further stated that each municipality must carry out the studies in advance.
It is therefore necessary to assess and decide when to be cured and to what extent to assess urban mismanages.
It will then also be added to the original manual for the particular piece.
Pietzschmann will come back again and make a picture of the situation, she promises.
Mr Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be mailed to the citizens in the coming weeks and may be completed until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow question book is the "building and basic books" where it comes, inter alia, about the construction state and the healing views.
In the Green Question Book, the "Home and Housing Book", details can be made of the size, division and population of a living room.
The blue business book is to be completed only if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it is worth noting that a full questionnaire is not an application for aid at the same time.
Moreover, new measures would not be feasible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the promotional resources would work in accordance with the "Windfung principle" - who comes first, must first.
You can't book any promotions for later.
Photos of the project "Ortskärn II" were also shown at the end to make the audience a "smack khaft".
British inventors set themselves a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microscope to open his house, run his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the Winnipeg chip between dams and display fingertips and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthetic consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that implant procedures are carried out according to medical standards.
The technology looks like a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northham also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on taxes.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer a thousand
The decision of the White House to fly a seaguller to South Lawn for an event that promotes American manufacturing in the last month costs taxpayers according to the military's data left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikersky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a round of products from all 50 countries.
The Hubschrugber made in Connecticut was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine, a train from Wisconsin and a cable sticker from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the Hubscher in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the Hubschers on the South Lawn, following the registrations of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Huschers.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the morning of the event of his predecessor, the representative marine commander for aviation.
The news showed that the hijacker arrived at the South Lawn on July 17, at 7:00 a.m. for the event at 15 a.m., and stayed so long until the race was extended between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew should be required to return due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew was in the event of the hijacker, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground during the flight.
It was not clear from the records made available to the TIME whether a second flight crew was needed at the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could damage the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a breach of the hack act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sound as if you were locked," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President urged the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to break the government's rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political benefit.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But only to require their use for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted a survey in February when the presidential aircraft delivered its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account was full of reports that the presidential plane was being used by his predecessors.
"The White House is inspired by the show "Made in America" - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn in order to accommodate US Presidents in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump started July on the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event accounted for the need to train the flight crew for the month, said an officer.
Helicopter units also fly 11 hours this day for "non-Presidentship support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requirements presented on the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in setting up the Hubschwarbeer on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not contain budget allocations for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to the U.S. Department of Defence for the financial year 2017, however, the rate of DoD compensation for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft in 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the hub are far below this level.
"The costs for the taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates are highly irrevocable," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study of 2015 the compensation rates for DoD do not include the staff costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At this time, the former White House press speaker, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the Hubscher for the event.
"The idea is to present this week's stuff that is produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal Republic of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security, and I believe that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the hijackers and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course it is appropriate to highlight it."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the Hubschoper when he was walking over the South Lawn for the event, but he was sitting in the driver's seat of a firefight.
In the White House, Trup spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and spoke with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikersky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News for more complicated tasks
The second Tennis-Bundesliga is the top leader in the searchdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss starts at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the tableside of the SV Searchdorfer.
Despite five parties, the chief executive of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has still received the sense of reality.
Chief of Team Marius Zay has respect for the opponent anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar format.
Just in the rear positions I find the man very well."
For class and stability in the searchdorfer SV, imports from the high north in particular.
"The teeth and finds can even refer to applications in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen, and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's always going to be hard for us.
Then you also need a good portion of happiness."
The new manship for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white may give Maxime Janvier.
If the moment is not created at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active Francoise is not the Bundesliga party, the Czech Liberal Zdenek Kolar (Czech) will come to his first use in this season at the tournament.
The previously unseen Chilene Hans Podlipnik Castillo was with the white Russian Andrei Vasilievski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the Ball.
But he should also be in Kiel, like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julian Cagnina.
After his two winnings last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
It is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, who was still one of the young world's rangers in January 2016, someone from the trainer's table around Marius Zay is filling the chain.
How the U.S. could damage OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump did not act as a mediator when he laid down his signature under the law for annulment of sanctions against Russia.
"In his attempt to pass the law," the Congress has packed a few "conventional regulations" in it, he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and Brussels itself was vaccinated against the US front.
However, the draft aims to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
In line with this, the two investors of the domestic OMV, together with other European companies, are encouraged to finance the construction of the Russian Baltic North Stream 2.
The drums are violent.
However, it would be too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official status of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to raise the sanctions to life through executive orders.
Twelve guns are his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the groups could change and what they could really owe him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel will be turned into the center of Netflix's emergency.
Despite the second stage of Narcos, which enthralled Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is not yet over.
The staffs were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil rates of the show.
With the third stage, the DEA focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali cartel.
Moved by four powerful patents, they operate "as a Fortune-500-enterprises" only with more government arrests and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (France Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann), and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that the American and Colombian criminal authorities invite to support the war against drugs.
More new players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third stage of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role Back Left: The city offers 46 kitchen help
The city reorganizes the China Midday Institute itself.
With firm contact partners for the children and an arrangement for the team.
The hour will be returned in the city's children's day-care centres.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld again takes over the food supply in the city’s children’s day-care facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, a young assistant leader, this is a good news: "We are all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and provides fresh cooked meals.
The city is located in the Kröfelder area 46 children's day-care centres, in 44 children receive a warm mealtime at noon.
In the past year, every 2800 children lived on the table, and the need grew.
"Mittler long doesn't only eat children who will be cared for 45 hours a week in the China on Wednesday," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour maintenance if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 part-time forces have since 1 September Cooking service: they heat the food delivered, reach it by salt, bread and fruit,porn the meal individually, give the food out, eat, drink, and clean the kitchen.
"Employers will be assigned a kite," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides over the hour.
"The kitchen assistants now belong to the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much stronger and it's easier to implement educational concepts for the guidance of the catalytic. "
For this too it is: healthy food and cooking.
"Children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team will be meaningful.
And for the kids.
"They have a well-known power in the Kita, a person who trusts them, and does not constantly change people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the China-room - so far also the task of kitchen forces - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, also the charm that it has shown itself in comparison with the cost of ownership and foreign spending for the city as the most economical of the city, it is from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time powers will be reintroduced.
"But these hours are not as strong as about 750 people in the area of education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, executive director of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be enrolled in the provinces at the Council elections. Three women apply for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the new voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be really representative and credible when women participate freely and are involved in all parts of the selection process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process that coincided with the transition from international combat negotiations to a consultative role.
In this year the elections will be submitted for the first time peacefully by a democratically elected government.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women of all registered 3.6 million voters have been registered.

GMB Warning about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A company would like to clear itself of the long-term obligation to produce in its work in Glasgow with the manager of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company had moved about the future of investments at Tollcross-Standardt.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which is produced in addition to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kexe.
McVities Owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade representatives would "hear first" if they changed their activities.
In a letter to the company's company's branch manager GMB Scotland McVitie called for "to consider that funding for modernising production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain a clear understanding of the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is a matter for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce has concentrated heavily on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social inclusion.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and well-being, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow requires a flowering production presence at McVitie".
A spokesman from Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this, as we appreciate the continuing commitment of staff and trade representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the staff that we, like all the companies that are engaged in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, are constantly reviewing our businesses - and that is appropriate for all of our business areas and places - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million dollars in our Tollcross standort, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as production sites completely and completely. If our operations are to change place, the staff and their trade representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn three years ago, Neymar?
The La Liga page may enhance your interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint Germain will not be released in her persecution of Neymar after giving a bid of £189 million to release his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the global record collapse?
The sensory approach has heated the transfer window in summer, as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million dollars.
After the end, Neymar will be the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete. PSG offers loans of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although it is a source near the Catalan state that the club has always given its best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president in front of this view?
As Manchester City 2014 gained interest in the signature of Blaise Matudii, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand against them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the Clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign when they sign up, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, where the Spanish Union began expressing its interest in the PSG-media field player Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could suffer the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for Neymar.
Turns around and damages
On the night of Friday on Saturday, a stranger has deliberately converted a roller set up in the Kings' Square before the entry number 30 and has set up a fine of over 200 euros in the clothing of the vehicle.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/27 01-0, is busy.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he had a car on his driveway, the driver of a VW Touran had to get out and touch the guide plane.
The 34-year-olds from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW against 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau were on their way to Leese.
In the area of Stolzenau's location, he had a pkw on his passport, so he had to move right.
The Touran Fahrer touched the guides.
The Pkw created Sachshaden.
The driver of the present Pkw, a Mercedes Benz, had overrun an Lkw and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the accident was not even noticed by the accident.
The police now invite witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the police station in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatten Report Discharged by Papst-Brüder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatten report on the abuses issued by Papst-Bröder Georg Ratzinger.
That means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen provides further discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the Reform Movement "We are the Church", explained after publication to the German press agency, he was expected by former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the Emeritized Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful to the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep concern about their own beliefs or their false assessment of the past.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" however criticized that the reporting of violence in the courts would be measured with "two measures".
With regard to the overarching in Regensburg, no one doubts that there is a need for "serious and humiliating acts" to be punished and prevented in the future; however, be the "grade of media manipulation", such as author Lucetta Scaraffea, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of identifying the Catholic Church as the source of all customs is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion on what to keep normal," writes Scaraffea.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayeric Roundfunk: "I like to go to the church and this is a found fresco".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "spares had been a very normal pedagogical means" "to be ready with healthy children, as I was one."
It began to apply today’s standards to previous decades because the world has changed.
In the context of reports on abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger was often involved.
Perfectly wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into custody," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Bistum Regensburg with the statement by Mr Ulrich Weber?
In total, 547 Regensburger Domspatzens were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of rapes, 67 Domspatzens were sexually abused.
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "It can therefore be concluded that, in many cases, the form of physical and psychological violence has been used by Domkapellmeister R.
The punishment for the students was even more severe in the case of high emotionality.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other defendants, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories are linked with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal was rejected by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Focles of Violence in the Protection of the Regensburger Domspatzen" provides a disturbing picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For many of his "humanity" students.
On the other hand, he also appears as a coller and perfectionist who became handy when a domspatz musically did not perform a top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all the same.
He has just been dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly free of any suspicion of mediation or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence rates at the pre-school also occurred outside its scope.
In any case, it is not possible to ask him to learn from it later or to take the first statements seriously.
The Domspatzen Gymnasium, on which he worked, was composed of practically all the questions as - so verbal - "Resolvement", "heaven" and "better world".
Similarly, the vast majority of his students, George Ratzinger, describes him as "heat-up", "loved", "competent", "competent" and "discreet" as extremely good teachers, who regularly provided the boys with kitchens, kitchens and bonbons and "always surrounded by children's dreams".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to Wutau's breakup.
That he not only broke his legs and held the key belt on the ground, but also distributed earpieces and went to the horses or ears too fast, he had given himself years ago, repented deeply and apologized for it.
However, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period of question, the 1960s and the 1970s, in the case of parents and teachers.
Do you even know such methods of training?
Of course, I think of each of us who was born before 1968.
I've also experienced it in a world school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the subtle sexual abuse and violence in the pre-school, it is free of charge.
It is already asked whether it is not more with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just come to grips with him.
Yes, many who have never understood him are still very proud of him.
But the truth is: The report leaves Georg Ratzinger in any way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the problem of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatten.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be responsible for any development or co-operation in relation to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not at all.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claim to have trusted the Domcapell Master.
Not even the parents were angry.
"I never believed to talk to my father or my mother about it," said a concerned gossiper to the others, "It was very painful for me."
The real problem with declaring sexual abuse was that most victims were being sneezed out of shame.
If they don't hire parents and siblings, then there's no one who's been a corollary who would have been a colleague of the dads.
How do Domspatten-Schüller Ratzinger's role in dealing with abuses?
Michael Hesemann: A questioning student formulated: "In addition to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had legal knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have kept the perpetrators concerned.
I think it is ... too absurd to accept that he is being judged ... the lips have opened more infinity or clarity or even more than against his parents, international leaders, confidence teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... is amazing."
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: "In order to persuade the students concerned in advance and/or their environment, they could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
With regard to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any co-operation.
Neither can he be persuaded to stop him or to be brought to the public.
There is no reason, therefore, to link his good name with these repugnant crimes, as in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "Gewaltexzessen" reading at the Regensburg Domspathen.
The former Domkapalm Master Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Water Views".
Does he have to live with this subject?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting system everything is wrong and has been linked to a huge message from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.
But that's exactly what the report is all about.
There is a clear distinction: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspaths, between sexual abuse and violence and, once again, we say other premises.
In addition, the report deals with events since 1945, as well as with four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the Domspaths.
The whole terrible spring pedagogy, the cases in which boys from Saudi teachers were regularly skided and maltified and left quietly below, came to the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhof, where they really had to rule out scandalous conditions.
But with them, Domkapell Master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he was only able to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzen Gymnasium.
It was about how most of the witnesses stressed the topic "Preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to be out and enjoy the so much better treatment and even for many "paradise" conditions.
So what else was on the domspatzten Gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: He was already a teacher of discipline, but there was no Saudi violence.
And this is also true of Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even in spite of violence, even positive memories with him".
This remains the highest priority of the project.
Despite all efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods of time in which it was reported by the members of the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and began to attend a school where he was not active and responsible, he did not want to hear anything (so the witness) and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger conclude that prior to the events, the ears are consistent?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen Gymnasium, which even reproduces the report.
In this regard, he points out that "to continue to practice the punishments in the pre-school".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommends urgent steps.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was being prohibited as firstborn punishments even in Bayern.
First, they arrived in a legal graison, as each of us may still know.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the victims might have been overrun or dramatized and where they really had been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always been gone.
It just doesn't agree.
As early as 1980, the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bayern.
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxi claimed yes, it would be unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are historians here discussing the "Fallstrike of Anachronism", so the risk of assessing past to today's moral standards.
That's where the cheese is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been out of control at all times and does not apply to what has been violated in the pre-school of reciprocity and violence to innocent children, which is already far beyond that of the common people at that time.
That's all very funny and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I need to take Georg Ratzinger into custody because all this had nothing to do with him.
Its means of discipline and punishment, so to draw the ear and the hair and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also held strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did George Ratzinger repeat in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Who is the subject of punishment also in the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells of his perspective, since the Domspaths only played a neighboring role.
Nevertheless, I do not regret that he has led a strict regime there.
However, this must also be said: without this perfectionism without the demands of unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible for him to form an institution of world-famous regensburger Domspatzen, a true cultural heritage of Europe and its musical tradition, both in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With keks and bonbons alone, one is now no big singer and in front of any success, as in any area, but always discipline, patience and self-control.
As for a person, how did you experience Georg Ratzinger when talking to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work of the book and beyond, I really knew Georg Ratzinger very well and always again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and sincere people who can't imagine that he could do anything but a flight.
I get regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family 23 years after his emeritus.
Those who do not forgive him until this day that he was strict with them are clearly in the least.
Most doms are grateful to him today that he has enriched his life and brought them the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, watery teacher - a strict father, of course, that might be - but he was also a loving person, to whom they still look today and who they just admire.
And please, once again very clear: everything you're looking at is the method of extraction that was then in the agenda.
We can be glad we've been over this time for a long time.
But it's most unfair to a man, just because he's prominent and has another prominent brother to make a media sin note.
There's the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.
Because the report, which was just published, leaves it.
Now, the condition would be that a 93-year-old man who has acquired large profits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany would not be able to leave the Regensburger Domspatten in peace at last.
