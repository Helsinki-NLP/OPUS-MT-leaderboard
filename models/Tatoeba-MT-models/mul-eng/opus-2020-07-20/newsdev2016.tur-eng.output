Norvec's rapist: Is this the world's biggest fish?
Norway's five million people enjoy the highest standard of living, not just in Europe, but in the world.
Could the country's secret success be linked to the local trade with some fish?
Take the past penniless choice.
Place these in the middle of the collection.
Leave me alone for a week.
Now you have one of the great Norwegian tattoos that will poison your face.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a car, a wonderful place, and it's always air-based.
Rakfisk is a blessing for you as long as you love coke fish for a year.
When it's dark and the weather is cold, the Norwegians are gathered here for a festival that's the greatest food ever.
The full-time local editor for the program is responsible for the restoration, and he says, "Rakfisk Generali" Havard Halvarsen says, "Put this in a tree and then drink a barda aquavit."
People around us eat little fish and drink too much.
Havard says, "Some people love aquavit more than arfisk."
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
It's not bad if you're able to get out of the hole, but it's a little bit different from a Sushi language after a long bus ride.
Rakfisk Norway's ice-cream is a very different pattern of the winter times expected in water and ice-creaming streams.
Then, when it is well-prosperous in the breasts of the flock, it will be carried out, and will be carried out with a (favour) of scalding tongues.
Just a generation ago, thousands had to leave their countries to find work in Norway, and most of them moved to the United States.
Now the focus is rapidly expanding -- more than 13% of jobs, high wages, and a comprehensive care system.
It's been a long time, and very soon, people from Switzerland, who are far richer than Norway, are working for the job.
Rakfisk represents something important, even though Norway's history is a little complicated.
Among the worst food you can buy.
But everything is expensive – you give £9 ($14) to a small beer bar or sandwich.
Norvech often doesn't come to my world news – and most people like it.
We want to talk about the name Anders Breivick, the last 77 years, the man, the woman, and the child who killed the gun.
Instead, it's called "22-year-old" murder.
The Norwegians are forced to believe that one of them in the warring countries will be able to commit such a crime and murder.
Norvech has been living under the richness of the world since the 1970s. One of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has grown.
"But Petroleum is not the only reason why we're so good."
We are, as you say, a rebellious people.
It's English, like most people here.
We're not very impressive, we don't like entertainment.
Norway has managed its own oil wealth very carefully – a special fund is invested in the benefit of all future generations except a small percentage of the money coming from industry.
While the rest of them had no money, during the years of the global financial crisis, Norway's accounts were often bound up.
"We're happy as long as we can climb the rock and write the mountain path," says Anna.
"And rhafisk when you eat," adds with a comfortable breakfast.
I'm standing on the street and waiting for something to eat, and I've had enough to eat.
Now there's certainly something different about a first hamburger and a nicer tattoo.
But tonight there's more than that coke fish.
One of the many places I've stayed in the hotel is where guests are the best – and perhaps the most stressful – fish.
There's a live television connection on a reverse wallpaper server with Rakhfisk tobacco.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"How many do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Our mountains are here, Howard."
There's rice. There's coffee.
There's a man coming down from the satellite, maybe in the effects of the aquavit.
Or maybe it's all about the taste of these fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough start.
While the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, is preparing to move to the office, he is looking forward to the hardships and frustrations his people face from BBC Will Grant.
Mexico's traffic is especially bad right now.
In the best of times, when a busy city, it has been fighting on its streets since the day of the Passover, with its various mother-in-law routes cut off from the capital.
But the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent the protestors from reaching the meccal.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will take over the presidency and take over the national administration.
Against a cruel task.
The continued administration of Felipe Calderon has a good economic performance in Mexico, but in the control of an estimated 60,000 deaths in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto told Uval Office U.S. President Barack Obama this week, "There's a big word for the people of Mexico to reduce the government's violence," he said.
I'm going to launch a new security strategy that will ensure that we reach this goal.
Mr. Pena Nieto's previous political experiment with the U.S. president of the U.S. has been chosen by his own country in Mexico.
The majority of the presidents around, the larger system, that is, in the old area, where new leaders are divided.
An open-minded man.
For example, it is remembered with love in the village of Valle del Bravo.
The people here are concerned about the fact that he's alive in the theater and the creation of the basement.
You can go from Mr. Pena Nieto's new cars to get to the town, and I'm making a great deal of progress on changed roads and tires.
In addition, posters bearing the name are based on modern sports centre and interactive climate change, with the exception of the museum.
"We look at him to bring about real and lasting change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and member of the country Congress member of the PRI party Gabriel Olvera Hernández.
Especially in terms of security and economy, we look forward to an interesting and real change in our country.
After 81 years of inexhaustible power, PRI was ruled by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the city of Los Pinos, he was very optimistic about Enrique Pena Nieto.
And the professor refuses to tell the new president himself in vain.
An open-minded man is calling himself a great country.
A great government man and a man who listens to everyone.
But that's not the idea that many people on the other side of the country are dealing with their old elections.
As a city, Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Nezaalcoyotl, could no longer meet the streets of Valle del Bravo's park.
It's one of the many ways to get on the highway. It's a gang of Mexican City.
And the problems in society are difficult and civil.
This year's army was called to assist in combating drug gangs working in areas of war, and more particularly violence against women.
A large wave of corpses was thrown into an empty space next to a part of the burial area, just two years ago, when we were just killed.
Mr. Pena Nieto was killed in more than 1,000 women in the country of Mexico, more than Ciudad Juarez, known for its violent and violent killings.
Mr. Pena Nieto says he couldn't address the problem of a woman's murder to the best way of doing it.
Worse still, they blame him for not seeing his rule.
In a typical concrete house in the kitchen, Irinaa Buendia is trying to fight with her age when she shows me pictures of Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the case, Mariana began her career in 2010.
But he believes he's killed by his family partner.
"When I went home, it was like the body was broken," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were traces of his fight, and death had already begun.
When his mother repeated the story, Mariana looked down from an image of a wall, with one word on it: Justice.
But that's what the family says they're completely rejected.
The authorities said to me that I was old, that I was in trouble, and that they acted like a rapist.
What they want is to simply accept what people say and close their eyes.
"But it can't be true when there's so much uncertainty and weakness," he says.
Mr. Pena Nieto comes with serious responsibilities on Friday.
Tens of thousands of families have been involved in violent crimes in Mexico for six years, and he promised to give them priority during the new post office.
Prime Minister Olvera says in Valle del Bravo, "He's a president like my uncle is a whale."
But this is the most scary family of victims in Ciudad Neza.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the bad behavior, the prosecutors say.
The prosecutors are trying to resist Bradley Manning's mishandling allegations.
Don't worry when Manning's army in Quantico and Virginia is in jail.
The defense wants the case to be closed if Manning's arrest is severe.
There are thousands of people who have been accused of playing the hidden document
On Friday, the defendants tried to indicate that the military accused of the largest secret material in the U.S. history had lost more than one chance of complaining about the bad behaviors that Bradley Manning had experienced during his military surveillance.
In questioning the press officer Maj. Ashden Fein Manning, Ft. Meade Maryland, before the trial, pointed out that during his nine-month stay in Quantico, Virginia, he did not show any complaints about the bad behavior of weekly visits.
One day came after saying that Manning was thinking of the prosecution while watching Manning's trial, because he was in prison and had been sentenced to enough punishment.
The army arrested in 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while performing a mission in Iraq.
Material was later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never proved that Manning is a source of information.
At the five-day meeting, Fein, which was held in the Quantico military prison, was held with Manning following a meeting in which he was held in a prison sentence held from June 2010 to November 2011.
Members asked Manning questions and noticed their results.
When asking questions about forms on Friday, Manning's guards said that the conduct of the guards was "good" and that all the tests were "many professionals".
The forms don't show a complaint about misconduct, even if the members question Manning's true conduct, Fein says.
He said that he was concerned about Manning and that they talked about the concerns of the visiting members and said they would be directed to them, but that they did not record them.
Manning said, "What they have written will not come to us, nor will it bring us any information."
Justice Justice Denise Lind de Manning asked why he did not complain about the actions he had taken during the October 2011 trial months earlier in which he had brought in his internship.
Manning admitted that his intention at the meeting was to "prevent the creation" status.
The army said that he and others had put him in a restricted position by a six-step security guard.
"I wanted something to know I was good, and I wanted to get out of POI... to enjoy a quality of life that was more than my dream," said Manning.
On Friday, Manning was arrested in Iraq and told about the transfer to Kuveyt, who was held for about two months before his transfer to the Marine Base Quantico prison in Virginia in 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuveyt, and he was there once because of the heat.
He said he was stressing that he would not be allowed to know what he had and what was in the outside world.
"My world has been reduced to Camp Arafjon," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of his days going to Quantico, at least 21 hours, and for 23 hours, alone in a small cell.
Manning said he was given only one bed, a bed, a toothbrush, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to move because he said within the day that it was different from the rules.
Man said he always sleeps with the light that comes out of his cell.
When he returned the night, he said, "If the guards had not seen his face, they would have raised him up and brought him back."
Manning's lawyer was in line with the behavior of Manning in October 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in November 2011.
At the same time, a statement made by Judge Manning on Friday in his statement on Friday, asked him about the forced night in Quantico's cell, the number of guards and the number of other inmates being forced to stand up.
He said he wasn't given a chance to beat himself up during the man's count.
On Friday, the judge said that the judge said he had to fire a battalion at the order of Manning, but no one had ordered him to shoot.
Manning said he was forced to sleep the night before, because of his habit of showing no danger for himself on Friday.
Manning said that he could harm himself by using the stick of his memory or the fingers between his fingers, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night he was taken from his teeth and eyes by his fingers and fingers.
The lawyer hopes that at least the trial will be carried out by the judge and that he will be severely punished in a military court awaiting his execution in the coming year.
The defense said that Manning would accept his crime in smaller cases and fight it in more extreme cases.
The situation is expected to continue at the end of this week, in a manner that will be planned, to discuss matters that are guaranteed by the prosecutor's custody.
Pentagon Manning indicated that all the maximum custody in Quantico was held in accordance with the rules.
Those who are against Manning, to help the enemy, to spread the story wrongly on the Internet, to communicate their national defence information, and to steal public property or records.
If the judge wears out all my belongings, he can face a prison sentence.
Mexican American Identity Crisis
Many people say it's hard to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity here.
"Mexicans are in my practice of trial; they remind Mexicans of difficult times,"
Navarret says Mexican Americans are stuck between the two worlds.
I was on a very difficult trip to Mexico City, and I was surprised to see you on a trip to Mexico City.
The signs were showing two kinds: one for "Mexico" (“Mexicos”), the other for "Extrajeros” ("Mechanics")
I stayed there for a few seconds. I wasn't sure where I was going.
I've been called Mexican all my life because I grew up in the center of California.
My friends in Boston at this ethnic stage call themselves Irish or my friends in New York say they're Italian.
Later, I decided to be a Mexican American.
But it was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's country, he didn't need a stanno or a terreo.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, I'm good enough to manage both sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have local words, and I can't save from my American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport, and I've gone abroad for Extraneros.
I thought about that when I visited White Sarah this week to meet the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, to meet President Obama.
In my day, the leaders of the two countries have always met: immigration, drug abuse and trafficking.
Pena Nieto was also willing to talk about the growth in the economy in Mexico so far as the Mexicans are trying to enter the United States now.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade blog in the form of the European Union in North America.
Pena Nieto promised to continue his fight against the drug cartels of Mexico.
It's complicated and we're in touch with the United States for Mexico.
Most Americans probably didn't think of the United States working in Mexico in 1848 and forced their leaders to rape half of their villages.
But it's not minutes, but reminders for Mexicans who have been thinking for centuries.
That's why when an U.S. agent says a little bit about Mexico, you'll start to hear complaints about how American neighbors have been subjected to the hypocrisy of their neighbors.
And Montezuma's kids will go to war.
And yet, there are more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States who are really violent for Mexico.
Do you want to talk about unexplained feelings?
There's so much.
There are people who have won and lost in Mexico who have not created the country's opportunities and those who have not.
The only reason many people living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, from Mexico, is that one person, perhaps a capital or a major capital, has to stay outside of Mexico and go north.
And most of the time, this guy's sleeping in a profile -- he's got a dog, a little education, a poor village, vs.
We are their prey and they are their prey.
Not Mexico.
And even if we don't live in the Americas right now, we'll never forget the fact that what we've been doing is not Mexico.
Our identity may be unknown at times, but our dedication is clear.
It's the United States.
We also realize that most Mexicans don't love us.
That's the opposite.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating experiment, and they look up to us as if we're not as low as we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relations with Mexico are never strong enough.
Our presence is all about failure in their eyes.
If our families didn't fail in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
And now we didn't find ourselves trapped behind the dark sand. Those who live well in the United States are still missing.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came to the United States as a legal child, reminds me that there is a disagreement between Mexicans and Mexicans because they are more often aware of who the Mexicans are and the Mexican Americans are involved in.
Although he is an American citizen, he sees himself as part of the two countries.
At the same time, most of the people I know don't feel like two Mexican Americans.
Both Mexican groups like to listen to Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You're getting the best of both worlds, but you're not pregnant.
We're seen as Americans in Mexico.
We are recognized as Mexicans in the United States.
Now, as I have learned on my trip, some Mexican leaders and others of the light want to re-connect Diaspora.
The Mexican Americans want to run as "primaries" in passing Mexico to show their interest in the United States.
We're trying to strengthen their ties with the political leaders of Mexico to tell us what a beautiful country it is to visit Americans like us.
Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.
We have so many feelings.
And we're not sure that most of us are a great country with inequality and widespread intolerance and drug abuse.
I'm afraid you're the only friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for their behavior in Mexico a hundred years ago, then some Mexican Americans still have to admit that they are still guilty of acts committed to family members more recently than that.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
The old wars, the new Middle East
There could be no possible basis for a fiery conflict between Israel and Hamas.
Can there be a constant conflict between the Arab and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood pressure shows that such a hope is empty.
Among the endless disputes that arose about who began, the building became a huge number, more than 140 Palestinians and six Israel were killed as civilians, and the first time from Gazez came close to the great city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Kuduz.
But the Israelites and the Philistines seem to be trapped in their earlier encounters, but the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arabians carried away the parts of the land into the air; and the Philistines and Israel were carried away captive into the wilderness.
Maybe it's more bloody than their fight.
However, there are reasons to think that this could destroy their killers.
What a battle that will be!
At first glance, it seems very difficult to get the best out of it right now.
The fires that were accepted in November 21 continued, but the war on both sides of the week strengthened the arrows.
Since 2007, Islamic leaders of the Gaza Strip have been claiming that the Gaza Strip has forced the Israelites to return.
Despite killing some of their leaders and arresting the 1.7 million people of Gaza, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas in one of the world's worst and most large cities.
Of course, Hamas has won the next half of the Palestinian battle in West Syria by the great giants of Fatah now.
Besides, Hamas' leaders can also determine the outcome of their time.
In the Arab world, the Muslims made Hamas strong and rich friends as they gained their souls.
In one of Israel's earliest Muslims, the most reborn regional power has been achieved by Hamas, and so has Qatar, one of the richest and dynamics of the Corfus countries.
A happy Hamas Islamist hero is saying that the ruling party of the Hizbullah army is headed north from Lübnan to Syria, and that Islamist training is directed towards the Red Esad, which can turn into Syria and threaten the kingdom of Hamas.
After all, the vast majority of Israel's southern Arab countries have changed the height of the Muslim Brothers' heights under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most prominent and most important of the Arab countries in southern Israel.
There was very little time for Hamas of Hüsnü Müsnürek, who led Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011.
On the other hand, it's more about the Sister Hamas's cousin and the leader of the town.
The future diplomat, Hamas, Israel and America, can be described as an actor that has not been stopped.
In the meantime, Israel's leaders will produce very different results.
In the military, he was put back in the Hamas box.
Israel's North Cuba proved its value in the anti-Fashion system, and many of Hamas' surfaces were destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep more comfortable for a while.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States has decided as far as it is concerned, and most European countries have accused Hamas of starting the last violent events.
After all, Israel, especially Israel, grew up under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who did not see the conflict at large.
Although the rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israel since 2004, Israel has been able to save only a few of the Israeli bombers who have moved to West Sheria, the main part of the Palestinian country in question and continue to expand their borders of Jewish settlements, despite international differences.
Mr. Netanyahu, who was still with the war side group of Avigdor Lieberman when the Licud party was elected at 22 Ocak.
Why are you surprised by these false Philistines?
If they really manage West Sheria, won't they fire rockets like their carriers in Gazze?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and punish them when they have to lift their heads.
Maybe the waiters will win, but the Arab will be able to change their accounts.
If the Muslims gain power in Egypt, and the rest of the tribes, they will fight against the oppressors in their homes, even though they are few in number.
Israel's defense belt is bigger than the League of Arab neighbours.
The start of war with the local superpower does not have much to do with improving the economy of the new Arab governments.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked with Barack Obama to provide a fire that seemed good, and maybe they could start something.
The Israelites must look far into the distance.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, the destruction of the rights of the Palestinians this week, like a bus in Tel Aviv, creates a barrier that is inevitable to spread in areas under Israeli workers.
In the Jewish state, pressure is already slamming democracy, and the Arab spirit is moving along with democracy.
Every few years, blood duties against Gazze will reach a large diplomatic body.
There is a need for an outsider on both sides
The story remains, on both sides, the majority of the outside world and the sensible people who are present in this newspaper: the two states that represent Israel's territory for security.
In a short time, a small hope for the future will give the oppressed foreigners a little more strength.
Now it's better for Gazze to start a cease-fire with Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, in order to convince Hamas, who is bound by the 1967 borders, to change his Jewish government's view of the land and accept his share of Kudiz.
Foreign Arabs must also force Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This will be much more effective than the federal offer of a Palestinian government, which is close to the BM.
Mr. Obama plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
For the first time, he neglected to pursue his own battle plan.
There seems to be no desire for entry into the White House.
This pain doesn't go any further.
America has a life-threatening Middle East.
This means an agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
cigarettes simply packaged laws into Australia
Cigarettes and diseased organs are placed in single green boxes for all brands
Australia's first law on tobacco and tobacco was introduced into the world, leaving brand logos and colors in place to the image of children and babies who are sick because of the use of tobacco by the medical authorities.
Printed with the same small type of brand names that will be needed after the Day of the Day, unless different health warnings and images are shown.
I'm the most famous ruler in the world to pack a bullet in the world.
The federal government of Australia says it's intended to discourage young people from smoking by cutting off the habit of smoking.
This is based on studies that show that people will never start smoking by 99 percent if they don't start smoking at the age of 26.
"You can see that all of the children since very young years have tried to sell on brands," said Ms. Tanya Plibersek, a federal health minister who took advantage of the work that showed that children are associated with the flag logo as a princess.
Australia has one of the lowest smoking levels in the world, and changes will have little effect on women of many nations, but other countries consider similar.
The whole industry has made a hard-on-the-law lobby.
He said all companies would support the black market and open the way to more cheap and more accessible cigarettes.
From British American Tobacco Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "There will be no serious consequences for Yasama,"
Those from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products to sell in the streets of Australia.
Others say it's increasing the work of the law.
A small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, from Sandra Ha, who lost almost her salary in British American Tobacco, British Columbia, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco Australia's high court, nearly two months ago, in order to mask unfathomable packages.
Zico says he's sold more than 6,000 to the shopping malls and he's waiting for a new stock.
It's a good job for us.
Scientists say that the potential increase is the population of the social media in the demographic target of the plan.
A number of Australian lawmakers moved the whole market after they had banned television advertising and sports sponsorship and wanted to keep most salesmen ’ cigarettes out of sight.
In Australia, local companies and websites have banned Internet advertising, but the sea does not restrict extra sites.
Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University, said, "If you're on the whole market and this little window is left to identify your products, you need to participate."
Freeman brands, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, have shown that there is an increase in "participation of people" on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Did this Marlboro cigarette we need to ask, did a really loving civil lawyer and videotape shop, or did a marketing company include it?
The British American Tobacco Australia said that it was intended to cope with new rules despite the fact that the industry was not marketed.
The Industri moved to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay money to read from the new rules, which state that despite the fact that no country has had a significant market with Australia, the trade has been unjustly restricted in the World Ticaret Organization.
A WTO decision is likely to emerge in mid-2013.
Plibersak said the government had made negotiations with other countries considering packing decisions.
In 2001, it was Canada's first country to warn.
Now more than 40 countries have become involved in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
There are more laws in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Most people in Australia read from the fruit.
Images don't affect me.
I'm here to see them.
When Victor El Hage bought a package with a photo of the eight-inch tube, he said, "Take a cigarette and put it on."
If I have to be honest, there's only one reason I'm leaving, and she's my little girl.
In the center of Sydney, James Yu, who runs the king's entire store, said that the single type package made it difficult to block the numbers.
Yu said, "It took me an hour before I released a message, and now it takes four hours."
He said, "The government had to record everything. Then we said, "Well, we're done and we're gonna close the store."
Fasting Is So Bad in a World
I spent five hours in the air without waiting for another plane.
So it's been a long time to think about depression.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Even if there are such things as books, magazines, magazines, and iPhones that are very exciting to look forward to flying in the air for half a day (even if I don't mention shopping).
But more and more, some academics and child development experts tend to be confused.
They say sometimes it's normal for us and our children to get stuck.
It's hard for the brain to go to interesting tanjants, and maybe it's increasing creativity.
And most of us don't experience the benefits of compression because we're connected to each other from a screen.
So we need to open the door to the heat?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to this.
First of all, I've realized that it's a new frame that allows a lot of people to spend more time in the middle of their lives.
Peter Toohey, who is a professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada, says that it is not so.
He said, "There's really a long story to tell."
There's a Latine wall letter from the first century on which Pompei's walls were closed.
The question is, how do we know how to be patient?
The problem is, it's said that it's widely recognized and discussed, John D. Eastwood, a psychologist at the York University of Canada.
After looking at the research literature and putting the idea before a group of about 100 people in the room, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were identified as a "system but should not be involved in satisfying activity".
The thing that separates you from poverty is that you don't want to be busy, but you don't want to be.
He doesn't have to do anything about poverty, he said.
"It's a breach of the process of focusing on the short pace and the slow pace of time," he said.
It can be much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood, who may be concerned, said only those who are troubled are in a position to see the problem around or the world, but those who are depressed see it as their own.
Sometimes we think we're stuck when we're just trying to concentrate.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experience when participants were listening to a report from a person who read a report from an article that they had read in the Psychological Science Reviews report in July.
Some groups heard a TV program that was loud and non-interested in the room, others heard it very little at a very low level, but the third group never heard it.
Those who heard the low-level television reported more stress than the other two groups, they lived without concentration, but they were not sure why, and they were related to the stress.
Mark J. Fenske, one of the authors of the work, and one of the students at the Guelph University in Ontario, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, it is difficult to focus on it.
On the other hand, when you read something complicated, it might help you not to be distracted by music, like watching bad devices in a factory band.
In fact, it can generally be seen as a sign of stress, making people physically weaker and vulnerable to it.
"It shows that children who are allowed to move are more educated than children who are forced to stop acting and are getting more information," said Professor Fenske.
We're all trying hard at some point, my flight's late, a monotonous talker, a frequent movie.
But some people think they're getting more stressed.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a "Development Size" in order to help measure this.
It's like, "I've got a lot of things to do and a lot of monotonous," and "I've got too much to do, I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University, said that researchers have found that using such measurements, researchers have found that men are more frequent in the sense of women and that they need to hear more and more.
But in general, those who are called by poverty are a very poor group.
In 1991, Professor Reed Larson, a professor of human and population development at the University of Illinois, conducted a seven-to-one test using a call device with approximately 400 adults and their heads.
He found that 32 percent of adults were in school and paid only 23 percent were in school.
On the other hand, they said they had 3 percent of the headaches.
Professor Larson said now 21 years later that he doesn't know if the percentage of depression is going to be higher.
But he said that he knew that what children and adults wanted to do was not given more control over what they wanted to do to the poor than that they knew it was "the time of the burning of the energy."
So I'm going back to my first question: is it good for a man to be bitten?
Sometimes no, because research shows that people may be able to get into physical risks, play dog games, or use material as a means of reducing them.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who worked on the subject for more than two decades, said that many philosophers and writers are talking about the connection between complexity and creativity.
Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the U.S., said, "It's the way I tell you that your brain needs to do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're pushing and using this energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it can make you happy in a short walk, but it won't be in a long walk.
So if you give your child an iPad when your child is pregnant, he can't be pregnant anymore, but he doesn't know how to have fun or how to fix himself, Professor Fenske said.
And he said, "This will move from one state to another,"
Your child doesn't know how to make fun of himself, but in other areas, he can control more.
I don't think we're going to want to be really happy.
We shouldn't be too excited.
Rather, our goal should be to be far away from playing with regard to activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood was involved.
"We need more compression, but it's painful, it wants to be connected to something that's not easy," he said.
He said, "It's a way of getting out of the money that people really are looking for, and enjoying their leisure time."
He said, "It's hard to find ways to be busy when the sound is closed in a neighborhood where we're constantly being warned."
No Senate for the New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, South Korea, was accused of committing a crime for something that would be legal in the world: a few pieces of marijuana and a pipe to drink.
One day, Mr. Orozco Elul said he and his friends were stopped while driving in Lamar, near the Kansas border.
After finding Mr. Orozco in the police car in the marijuana car, everyone received a call for a small criminal, transport and drug dealer's car and was sentenced to court history.
"We were treated as guilty," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he?
For the sake of entertainment, Colorado's small volume of marijuana is largely dependent on the answer to the law of hundreds of small drug addicts in weeks.
Hundreds of minor criminal marijuana cases are already closed in Washington State, where a similar procedure is approved.
The police force has left the charge for a small mass transport legally approved by law within weeks of our 21-year-olds and senior adults.
However, in the more occupied regions of Colorado, the prosecutors have vowed to prosecute the existing marijuana cases in a decisive manner and are still calling on people to be brought to trial for moving.
At the same time, several towns from the Danube Bay to the Western Mountains are used to prevent the opening of marijuana shops in the regions of the new country.
Aurora's police chief, Daniel J. Oates, in the north of Denver, said, "This thing's growing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen later," said Daniel J. Oates.
And the editors in Washington State are losing their heads.
And they're looking for a license system to be set up for manufacture, sale, distribution and sale on April 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado is in front of most of the state with regard to the preparation of marijuana with fun.
"They will have a more orderly market in Colorado, which is why they will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, Internal Control Organisation in Washington.
But he went on to say that no place or system could do more than suggest what would happen.
"There is no real example to follow," he said.
Washington's law, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 April and the state's licensing system will leave a year's uncertainty about the legal transfer.
In the meantime, there are difficult mechanical issues to be resolved, such as how to apply the directive to "extended access" to the licensee by restricting schools, parks, children's parks or children's care centres to 1,000-feet establishments.
Ben Livingston, the new set of research groups, said, "It's not difficult to find licenses anywhere in the city, especially the Great City Area of Seattle," said Lawal Kenevir Central.
On 21 November, Chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail saying that the city attorney would not blame 21 years of age and above for no one in the small Marihuana and that the police would let the people be charged with these crimes.
The chief Oates police said they would lay down city laws that would correct the developers of marijuana and follow drug dealers and sellers again.
Ken Buck, the district attorney in North Colorado, represents another meeting.
After the vote, the majority of the office said that it would continue to monitor the move to marijuana as a way to force users to be treated.
Now, 119 people face other charges when they're accused of carrying two men or less of carrying marijuana.
Mr. Buck said in a statement, "There is a need to bring charges against criminals when they're in our office."
Even in places like the Red Sea, where the moons refused to enter the Marihuan.
The biggest city in the region is now the police in the Grand Junction no longer charge adults for small amounts.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but decided not to close the cases pending at the same time.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time in applying the law until it changes," he said.
It would never be easy to bring the fun marijuana into the government and the legal system, even though 55 percent of those who supported the season in Colorado.
And controversial trends that are prevalent in the esophagus create a deep gap between local authorities about the country's great green experience.
The National Organization's local spokesman, Sean McAllister, who represented the defenders of Marihuana, and the Reform of the Marihuana Laws, says that this region is "a nuclear barrier" to its prosecutors.
"They spent a lot of their lives accusing people, so they still don't accept it as legal," he said.
As the first countries that treat marijuana as alcohol in small quantities, Colorado and Washington are ready to have national tests on drug abuse.
Lawyers and government officials are waiting to be transferred from a federal government planning to bring the marijuana sale and the production of the product into federal hands while planning a new restricted sale for legal sale.
The law-enforced marijuana lawyers hope the Court of Justice will be brought back.
In spite of the high profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government of Colorado, Washington and other 16 medical marijuana operations have been authorised.
In Obama's administration, former drug policy discussion, Kevin A. Sabet said that drug agents would probably not enter the doors to capture a small drug bag, but they would probably not allow them to sell their entertainment marijuana stores, which the country under the new laws allows for.
A few cities in Colorado don't expect federal authorities to move.
Even before the election day, some local governments have agreed to reimburse new marijuana shops, which are about a year later, so that they can open up some local governments.
Last week, Montrose brought a six-month law to the town in the west, and it's probably our next week's reception.
"We don't want to be brought to a state where this is a big federal problem," said Mr. Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
He used a voice against the change in our area.
We're looking at the region's playing against the situation.
There's too many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was arrested from Oxford because I was a lawyer
It's just today's students don't want to be attacked because of their encounters.
I can't remember when I didn't dream of winning a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother and my sister were in a place that fostered the thought of freedom of thought and tolerance of society at the Greek Symposium.
But in two weeks I collected my bags in the Worcester College to read history at the end of the sexes, and I started my first life scandal.
My father was tired and crying.
Friends are surprised.
Eve's standard day in my room said I was leaving because I was against my friends who were having sex in the room.
Writer A. Wilson heard that I was leaving because I was forced to drink the broken fin.
It's a little less funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was against systematic sales and fear.
Not because my name's a little weird, or because I'm coming from a private school.
I've only been condemned for one reason, and on the fifth day of this explanation, this was also the head and the barbaric: my father, Merhum Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher, was a high-profile speaker, and I supported the developers.
You can ask why I'm opening this up.
According to recent reports, the new generation of middle-aged students are getting out of similar trials.
In Oxford, he became so angry with the college students that last week, a group of gays, intelligent people and ethnic minorities asked for the same rights.
Corpus Christi College's third-class partner room (JCR) was declared to be "inspired that they had been thrown away in a very active way, that they were subjected to personal assault and that they did not want it."
They want to create a publication in the same committee of opportunity of the university so that meetings can be published free of charge.
The new BBC Two-Bidish Wonderland also did not help: Young, Parlak and right-wing authors of learning politics appeared to be strange and neo-Nazi.
The message of former president of the Oxford University of Lawyers (OUCA) was presented by Joe Cooke as a golden band dress with Rolls-Royce and as a golden head button.
In other universities, academics say that they are treated as "stupid" for higher education fees.
Luke Black, 20, Nottingham University, U.S.A., told a post-primary press assistant in the Union that "there is a left-wing gap in universities."
"People think we're like Bullingdon Club before they meet us."
In Corpus Christi, a history student who has taken the lead in the move for better protection, says 21, such a environment is "no peace," but Stephanie Cherill, 19, says that the elected leader of the UCA is a violation of JCR members' rights in their dealings with right-wing people.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual competition and to the well-being of members," he says.
In the first few weeks in Oxford, I was the only person I've ever had.
In 1986, at 18 years of age, I went as an unsatisfying adventurer.
He was at the hottest time against the party.
In the first year, she voted to refuse the honour of former student Margaret Thatcher because of her high-school scholarships.
This atmosphere has frightened a Stalinian side.
During the first few days of the first week, I saw the pain I was going through when my students were socializing with each other and with their educational assignments.
I'd have to see if I could see that the educational tasks were being carried out with the college students.
The president's political training was brought to the top panel rooms against the Madenci Grevín, the Specialization and the Government, which were divided into South Africa.
The first 18th century was about translating French texts into English, and I was not ready for those who came later.
Professor Harry Pitt said, "Mr. Wyatt, please turn the first paragraph,"
That's what I did.
It was Pitt, a little man who looked like a face-to-face mask.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just fools?"
The other students of the license had been kidnapped.
The eyes hurt the back of my eyes.
"I suggest you take basic French courses, if you're not very involved in socialism in your leisure time," Pitt said.
I walked back to my room with a heavy picture.
That night, I sat alone at the university at dinner, and then I felt a mild touch in my shoulder.
This was a second-class English student named James, who was a member of the OUCA.
He said, "I know who you are."
I'm afraid so.
He's dealing with anyone who's suspected of being a spy.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the first-class student students behave like a working party.
And then, in a local bar, I tried to do terrible dances.
I insisted on not participating in anything Mrs. Thatcher said.
This proved tactical failure.
An Iranian first-class PPE student in Eton said, "You're a fascist domino girl,"
You're registered.
The other students kept themselves.
I was wrong, I was wrong.
Someone asked, "How are the kidnappers sexing?"
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt as if the sexes had felt before the liberal act in the sixties.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people with the same idea only when it's dark?
Would I go back to my work party and print my birthdays?
The three years before me were like a summer and lonely vacation.
The only open professor of modern history at the university was Professor Norman Stone.
He was also hated for being one of Thatcher's foreign politicians and writers.
He's been there a lot.
Because he was small and far from there, and he was tied to the historic meeting that Marksist needed.
In 1997, Ankara began a professorship at the University of Education in Turkey.
He said to me, "You're not going to be happy there,"
From Oxford, I started going to my grandfather's house in London, and I had more open friends in the city and my family.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I told him why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political encounters were accepted in the courts during their own time.
Sadly, he said, "But it's the best place in the world,"
They won't do this, not between my ghosts.
Even my Communist friends always had perfect conduct.
It's getting dark eyes.
Give me a chance.
I'm sure all of this is a joke.
If you split up, my heart's broken.
I was tired of the emotional stability I had experienced from my frequent visits to London.
One of my boyfriend's boyfriends was very proud of the press and rejected his faith.
I decided to do the same thing during the next week's lesson.
In a way, I'm embarrassed to admit that my brain's broken by my brain, and I told them, "Old idiots."
It's too short to ask.
My father was the one who called the tea on the table of my career at Oxford.
Then, every week, Murdoch wrote two poems.
My door was locked.
In there, I had a headache, and five minutes later, the people behind me died.
When they left, I prepared a boat and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can say I'm a fucking jerk.
But no one in 18 years of age needs to be so afraid and discouraged in a educational institution.
Even more tragic, Oxford's appearance of 14 prime minister and the fact that he has not earned the same equality and freedom of thought as he has so far.
He's got two men in Trabzon.
Trabzon's right-wing in Yomra's neck has broken down the second grade.
When two women who had been wounded in the valley of the wilderness perished, the way to the village of Shavan was blocked.
One of the two women who had been missing was found dead.
The rain has been active at Yomra's high altitudes at 3 p.m.
By the time the second stage was moved, the 2nd village was located in the water about 200 metres from the road that connects it to the Shavan village.
Abraham Karsli, from the village people who are close to the opening of the road to inform the authorities of their arrival, says, "The road is closed for 3 hours.
We live the same thing in every heavy rain.
We've informed the authorities, but he's coming, he's not going.
The parents are dying.
We live this stress every year.
"The trees are flowing out of the water when they reach the level," he said.
A CONVERSATION WITH A NEIGHBOR
Yomra told the President of the House that one of the two women, who had been lost at the end of the year, went on to call the other.
He remembered that the right side of the river, which was active in the river, had survived the plague, and the two women had been trapped in the wilderness of Tashdelen.
Sakyroğlu, who said that his call work lasted until late in the evening, said, "The work of the Belledian machines was finally reached by the body of one of our cousins under the ground, and they continue to call the other."
He added that the drought, the loss of the person, and the work in closed roads were carried out in a calm manner, indicating that the rain had destroyed the effect of the rain, leaving his place in the sun.
It was reported that while the missing women were on their way to search, the village of Tashken was on their way.
"YELLING ON THE SHOW"
In the Tashdelen village of Trabzon, which is associated with the Yomra, relatives are trying to cover the wounds of the cell and the respiratory tract that come to the right end.
He said, "It's not like the rain is raining."
Tashkara, who said, "We've stopped collecting garbage.
That's what happened later.
And the wind was blowing, and the wind was blowing, and the waves were blowing.
Then they returned to their houses, and they were caught in a rage."
He added that there was no electricity in the area and that there was no water.
Hasan Selim used the expression "if the rain continued for an hour, it wouldn't have stayed on the rocks" to say that he was 60 years old.
Of course the College rewards success!
Natural College provides students with a chance of a 100-percent bus in line with the OYP success rate.
According to the press and the audience, the South College, which has won global education models in Turkey and the world, supports successful students with a four-year bus chance to reach 100 percent of the Done Anadolu Schools in which the T-MBA education model is applied.
Only students with the T-MBA, which is the highest license programme for students applied to the Schools of the South College of Anadolu, start in the course of higher education, starting to work at the university and in life.
For the past three years, the Dong College, which has reached the highest level of high school in SBS, has been encouraging and supporting the success of students by awarding them a scholarship.
The results of the T-MBA study model, which is based on the Doga Anadolu Schools, vary from 5% to 100%, according to the student’s success.
The South College, which paid 491 students in the OYP to 100 burs, represents the percentage of students in the field between 481-490, 471-480 for students in the field between 60 and 451-470 for students in the field.
In order to promote student success, the College of Nature provides 321-450 OYP scorers with burs in events ranging from 5% to 40%.
Turkey's most successful students prefer t-MBA.
The success of many schools in the SBS prefers Turkey's most successful students, with the success of the SBS, the T-MBA model of education that has won to Turkey and the world through the understanding of South College's youth and vision education.
The high-licensing programme for students with t-MBA, applied only at the University of Anadolu Schools, begins in the course of higher education, with more courses in the field of business, and starts at the university and in life.
Students, Students, Teachers, T-MBA Applications, Foreign Language, International Projects, Association of Disciplines and the Society of Education and Social Affairs, who are leading the university's high-ranking licensing programmes, are developing in the field of education.
The chances of the nature's bursing are also passed on in the Oxford conceptual camps...
In the first year of the Oxford Quality School, which has developed with the cooperation of the Oxford School, and has demonstrated its success in the first year of the SBS Turkish Championship, Oxford's concept model of education has also changed from 2% to 75%.
Between 481 and 490 OYP score students, with 75% scored in the South College, provide a 50-fold chance of winning between 471 and 480 score students aged 60 to 451-470.
"The investment we have made to our students is the investment made in Turkey's future."
In drawing the bottom of what they've always heard with students, the South Korea CEO is concerned with the opportunities of the burs: "The College aims not only at academics, but also for the generation to succeed in every area of life.
In this objective, we encourage our students to achieve better and better success by paying off their achievements in sports, art, and music.
As teachers, we know that each student is different from the field in which he or she succeeds.
The important thing is to get them out and find out what they're capable of, and improve their success by relieving them.
The investment we have taught our students is moving with the knowledge that the investment made for Turkey's future, and we reward all their achievements."
Winning is always good
Hope Davala said they left a tough game back. "It's not easy to get three points, but it's a joy to win."
G.Saray said it was a pleasure to begin the season with the G.Saray Assistant coaching, Ummit Davala, with the exception of Gaziantpspor.
Davala, who recorded that they had bought two cups before the new season and lived in some parts of the Gaziantaspsport, and that they had a comfortable football in the game, said, "It's always good to win.
It's an active group of gasantespors, but everything we found was easy for us later."
BURSA MACHI KOLAS OLMAZ
Davala, who added that the players missed each other and gave three points when they ended their grief, said, "Now we have a strong Bursasport deposit.
The games aren't easy to win.
We don't see any doubts in the bag as we're called, and the tapesport game is proof of that."
How the One Who Counts the Treasures Takes the Moon
I'm going to try to help you to find out about the problems you're facing in the area of social security, or what you're interested in, and what I'm going to do for you.
Our readers need to write down the necessary information on social security and work life.
From this, I'm going to bring you the most accurate, healthy and reliable news in the Journal of Hyuriyt and Hurriyet.com.tr.
First of all, I want to get the silence file that's very loud in the town.
We'll take these letters, which will continue in writing, as sections.
In our letter, you can answer all the questions about greatness with your mother's lines.
You can send your questions to alippet@hurriyet.com.tr.
I'm going to be in a deep storage room to answer you as soon as possible.
What's the weight?
MALULEN is able to meet the security requirements set out in the SGK law so that SSKs and the All-Kur can lose their job in at least 60 years of age, who are unable to work and who are unable to work.
It is also possible for the people who have lost the ability to win in the community to the extent that they cannot perform their duties except those who are assigned to it.
Who are they?
I'm writing from the newspaper, my name is Mehmet Gültekin, I have 920 days insurance and 540 days military debt, and I have 1460 days insurance.
Also, I'm a kidney patient.
I'm connected to the diagnostic machine.
I'm still working on a job.
Can I have the moon of glory?
- Well, thank you, Mr. President.
You didn't specify the first time you entered into a job.
But we will briefly explain how the moon will connect you.
Firstly, the most important condition of the law must be insurance for 10 years, and the total day of the 1800s should be yours.
In addition, you will be considered vulnerable when you are diagnosed with at least 60 percent loss of your work force or the result of work accident or mental illness.
But you're here because you're a diabetic patient, you make 60 percent of the condition, because you don't have a month to complete the number of 1800 press days.
Of course we don't know how many years you've been working.
Your 10-year-olds and the 1800-year-olds will be connected to you on a monthly basis by registering your separation from work.
Ways to Win the Prize for Riches
Can't anyone be pregnant for 10 years, not 1800?
- The press payment rate must be completed in 1800 days.
However, there is only one exception; it is linked to the month of disability for those who are found to be vulnerable to the constant care of another.
What diseases or disorders are to be addressed in the sections of our letter that we are going to continue to see.
Status of people with disabilities before starting to work
I'm Ahmet Güler.
They said that while I was carrying all the procedures in the law of the SGK, I was told that you would not be able to pay me a full month because I was sick for the first time.
I'm too busy.
Isn't that unfair?
How am I supposed to be pregnant?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written that you've provided all the medications in the law, but it shouldn't exist before there's a disease that is based on the loss of work for the SSK and the Allied insurance companies.
Because you're not carrying this condition, it doesn't involve a month of glory.
However, if you have an age insurance policy, you may become pregnant when you have an abortion.
- I've got 3980 days, and I've been on insurance for 16 years.
I've been diagnosed by the SGK before I went to work.
They said you wouldn't be ashamed of me.
What am I gonna do in this situation?
I'm not gonna be fine.
Can you show me the way?
- Yeah, you're right.
You can't be rich.
But you know, the SGK law also has an illness record.
So there are two cases before and after October 2008.
If you first started working before this date, while the SGK indicates that you were pregnant before your work, you can have at least 15 years of insurance and 3600 press days with a condition.
That's why we suggest you be in the monthly connection request, applying to the nearest SGK Administration.
- Well, if you were on duty after 2008 then you could have had a minimum of five years insurance and a minimum of 3960 days of age, old age, and death insurance.
Should we get out of work while we're starting?
I'm still working as a driver on a job.
When I went to the hospital, he gave me cancer identification.
I want you to be a jerk.
Should I leave my job in this situation?
Can't I apply to the moon of honor without being separated?
I don't want to stay out of work until the moon is closed.
- You're right.
You need to be separated from your job to give you a monthly connection wish.
But before we start the month, you need to be classified according to your SGK law.
However, if you are rich, you are bound to have a month with other circumstances.
It doesn't mean you're willing to give a monthly connection without being appointed, and you're at risk of being unemployed.
That's enough of your 1800 days.
When you go to SGK and give me a chance to prove my weakness, the SGK will love one of the patients you've been exposed to.
And when you bring the health institution report you're going to get from here, the SGK will value this report in its own health institution and decide that your cancer's work force affects you in 60 percent of your working time.
However, if you have to complete the 10-year insurance period to connect your month, you will be able to join the month.
I mean, as soon as we can say, it's not wise to apply the SGC health institution without seeing the decision "unless".
But if any non-workable insurance agents remove all conditions, they may require the SGK and the connection of the credit status and monthly.
This situation may be useful if it's rich and if it's going to be the other way around.
Will he be free from obligation to the Lord of the Worlds?
I'm a bank security officer.
I'm leaving everything.
But they said, "You will not be blamed for your debt."
What am I supposed to do?
- I'm valuable.
Whoever told you was right.
You don't write what other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, it's necessary to pay your price of 4/b.
But I can give you a special quote.
I advise you to pay your debt to banks or similar institutions so that they can connect you with money.
As soon as the month is connected, you'll take more months and you'll pay in advance.
It will be easy for you to be held responsible for what your months have cut off.
The month of deposit is connected to what status?
I worked on both the SSK and the Kung-Kur and the Emeley.
When I'm right, how is the moon connected to me?
- The valuable school, the Association, the SSK and the Member, is your most valuable month, which is the last time you've worked as a member, which is the last time you're away from a place of insurance and you're taking a month off from SSK by registering other conditions.
SGK and related hospital reports
How's the real estate application made?
Which hospitals can I get a health report?
- It's enough for you to contact the Social Security Administrations or Social Security Centres that you're involved in for health care reports.
The SGK will love you for health care education and research hospitals, university hospitals (except private universities and temporary hospitals), Turkish Armed Forces military hospitals.
However, in the absence of these patients in the year you have studied, there may also be a loving process for the health care services provided by the Office.
Isn't it possible to love a private hospital?
- It's possible, but it's only possible.
In the former edition, the love of sleep and life-threatening patients who are able to build their sleep and life-threatening illness will now be able to agree with the GKK, and the health reports that you have received will also be appropriate for those who have experienced the treatment of fatigue and who have been admitted to another life-threatening hospital.
What are the conditions called for in love?
It is sufficient that the security available at the SEVK is primed for the construction of the service of love for the state of dignity.
Hospital expenses related to the maternity clinic will be paid by the SGK.
And it won't take ten years of insurance.
In the case of the connection of the month of residence, if the person has access to the property at a risk level, the period of 10 years of insurance between the conditions of insurance is limited to 1800 days, and the month is connected to the health institution report.
That's why when a person first comes to the hospital for his disability, he's probably going to the clinic only for 1800 days.
Nargile Operation
Nargile began to experiment for laws that began to apply to coffee.
The last week's controls had to stop many commercial transactions.
In Zabuta, the operation was started with a telephony in nargic coffee shops in Istanbul.
The sale of narriel coffee in the region of the nargi was stopped with the operation of non-smokers.
The first step is to cut money off the employees who continue to sell the nargi when all the narcissies are affected by controls.
If the line continues, it will be closed and closed.
PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST
The TAPDK was published last Saturday in the month of the TAPDK, "Requirement of the Qualifications of the Qualifications in the Use of These Lands".
It was known for a period of five months that the narcissists were moving from schools to schools at least 200 meters away.
And we're also saying that it's in secret places that it's used to sneezing.
On the first day of the operation, the case began in Bešiktash.
Al Faker, who is among the most popular Narratives in Istanbul, had to stop selling in Bebek, and the Nargile Coffee Ikram in the Middle East and Miss Nargile Coffee in the Middle East.
The sanctions begin at 23
In the battle, punishments starting with 23 000 TLs will be cut from non-smokers.
The places where the money is being punished three times will be denied.
According to the authorities, there are now about five businesses in Istanbul who have a nargic spirit.
Warning about too many flagsboard size
TAPDK, a 27-year-old TAPDK, made it necessary to make the nargic bottle the operators needed to make their nargic bottle ‘sustained’. According to the published dictionary, health warnings were sounded in the form of nargic bottle, or in the form of a konic form.
Warnings are applied in a way that starts from the mouth section of the bottle.
Blue, red, gray and black may be used to print health warnings.
There's a lot of warnings in the coffee shop right now.
Critical warning to families from security
The Security Authority warns families about the activities organised under the name "white camp" to gather outside legal entities.
The team of the Anti-Terrorist Smube Administration, the result of a 17-year census, has put in place a new plan of acts of violence during the journey, including DHKP-C, MLKP, TKP, TKIP, and some legal structures.
He warned families that the "white camp" was organized under the name of the "grandparent camp" in order to gather the terror assets and that children would not be sent to these camps.
The terrorist police, who found out that they planned to organize 41 camps in different years, wanted their children to be sent to these camps with families.
He refused to send his 350 family children to the camp
The terrorist police, particularly DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP, have warned against the activities that young people are planning to win in the event of terrorist attacks, such as DHKP-C, MLKP and TKIP.
The 350 families who took note of the police's warnings refused to send their children to camps.
After the police warnings, 41 camp 14 were scheduled to be set up.
Terrorists have made 20 campaigns against the decline of my participation.
The security forces indicated that two camps were still on, and five camps were scheduled to be set up in the future.
The Security Authority has also sent a letter of notice on these camps to the teams for all years.
Young People Ask...
The 20 camps that were carried out by Zizmir, Kokaeli, Balikasir, Chanakkale, Niğde, Eskishehir, Bursa, Bartın, Artvin, Mersin and Hatay were also held in Ordu, Samsun, Trabzon, Bartın, Izmir, Bolu and Adana.
According to security reports, these camps are mostly attended by young people who have won the university.
Unlawful terrorists win in exchange for their propaganda in the camps.
In these camps, young people who are newly involved in mass education are also being given higher education, and young people are becoming more involved in mass education.
In these camps, under the picture of the field of writing, education is given in matters such as "how to turn acts into violence."
Half an hour and then I'll send you a message.
Dennis Komsa found his owner in the U.S. state of New Jersey, New Jersey, where he was sent to the Atlantic Ocean 50 years ago.
Cam bottle came out of the house after Sandy Karygasse, who came to our last year in the United States.
He said, "Please answer the following questions, and send me the following address.
This is a scientific research conducted by Dennis Komsa (12)" he writes.
In writing, the person who finds the bottle wants to tell you where, when and how he found it.
He's also making money to pay for a gift and mail.
The August 16, 1963, issue of The Watchtower, which was about 35 miles [35 km] away from the scene in New Jersey, was presented to the owner during the past few days.
Komsa, who was about half a century old in 1963, said, "I was surprised to see the bottle put on the ocean, thinking they'd find it, but I never imagined it would come back to me."
Loves sound frequencies
He told me what to do with the sound frequencies of South Pamir from Turkey's first sound engineers, and I was surprised.
Sound technologies or sound engineering are likely to come up with sound systems of music for everyone's mind.
And did you know that terrorism can be prevented by sound technologies, that it can be committed without a voice frequency, that you can love the person you want, that you can recognize a secret, or that you can live according to the pace of the world?
After completing the Department of Inquiry, the University of Information took a degree of sound engineering from the SAE College in England and mastered sound technologies at Middlesex University.
The Communication Technology Academy, which is founded in Galatasaray, also develops sound engineering at ITM and provides courses such as music technology, sound technology, performance technologies, electronic music and recording technologies.
Thermal Subliminal Message of Terrorism
"What sound technology exactly?" the first question is.
"A technology that can be used in many parts of the world.
Our brain's got everything in its power.
The sound frequency is a kind of electricity, it's energy.
Using this energy, you can change people's minds, you can make them move with the command you want."
One of the most important underlying values of sound technology is the subliminal message.
In music or song, a message is placed in a frequency other than a human's original limit, which is not identified by the above memory, but goes underground.
For example, when a terrorist attacks were taken, Pamir told the region that a music release could be made.
If a message such as "Do Not Take This Attack" has been changed to the published song, it is optionally recognized by terrorists.
I don't understand what you hear, but the underpants take it, and a voice in it comes like, "Don't do it."
He considers it to be a messenger from Allah.
But in the world and in Turkey, these messages are definitely used outside public security.
It's a sub-liminal message prepared to tell students about it at a conference at Istanbul Technical University.
"I listened to the students during the conference.
I put in the music a voice frequency called 'Su'.
At the end of my interview, I asked them not to bother the students.
They say they're all very upset in a strange way."
According to Pamir, there are those who use the subliminal message as a runaway, "some of the radio channels in our country have been identified as doing this, but the details are not yet known.
There's a channel called "Kara Voice Radiosu" in Germany, a frequency for radical Muslims.
There are messages that attack by subtly means, religiously involved, militaryly calling, drug-inhibiting.
The German police and the Turkish police know this, but they don't happen because they're constantly changing frequencies."
Also, in the music world, such dangerous messages have been used.
Especially in the song of some heavy metal groups...
According to these claims, there was not even a terrorist on the planes entering the tunnels, and the attacks were carried out under sub-liminal orders.
Desktop
Sound technologies can also be used in criminal cases.
This knowledge is especially used in the U.S. bank accounts.
For example, when the police are on the phone with the police officer, they can identify who the sound person is on the phone, where the bank is, and what the room is.
It's different from the side of the metal, the roof, the plastic, the wall or any other material.
It is also possible to detect the size of the room, according to the sound of the bell, even detect the shape of the room, and determine how many blocks it has.
In turn, it can be identified by what kind of objects the offender has found, what size and how much he is in a room.
There was also a computer program used for this that Pamir even made drawings of an opera building from Tartaristan, which I thought "where the 175 Hobarl is located, perfect sound level can be maintained.
It's not a cheap technology, it's worth $4-5 billion."
The sound frequency is also used in the mimary and decoration.
There's a lot of work that Pamir has done on this.
For example, at a restaurant where people go to work, where they're going, where they're going, where they don't go out of the table.
Only those on the desk can hear what they're talking about.
There's nothing else on the table that's been talking about two steps ahead.
And the general system of these types of systems is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you combine it with another sound in your molecular structure at the same frequency, and you turn it into a medium that destroys the existing sound energy.
No one's ever built a plane without this system.
Because the sound of the planes is so high that they won't be answered.
These voices will attack one another on the plane and destroy themselves.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can create a space of distance from the noise in your house."
Was the pyramids made with sound?
There are other interesting things that Pamir, one of Turkey's first sound engineers, did.
For example, he arranged for an open air drive in the province of Hawaii to be able to hear music out of the air.
He can't get out of the line, compared to another sound frequency, and he's destroyed.
If you want, even in a room, it can be made without voice after a certain line.
He brought the sports hall and the sports hall and the concert hall.
I mean, it's double use.
Because when you play basketball, you need to be on the side, but you don't have to be on the side in the concerts.
It's also possible to provide sound technologies with a quality that only music can be heard in the opening concerts.
"We're using frequencies that make music more pure and clean.
The MTV is so much ahead of it.
He's editing the opening concerts and feels like a studio record in the sound field."
It's been such a test for Tubbitak.
With their frequency of sound, two aluminiums differ from one another.
There were some scientists who claimed that the pyramids of Egypt were made with sound.
They thought the rocks might be removed with sound.
"Aren't you comfortable with bad intentions?" I ask.
"I was very afraid when I read the work of the University of York from the Internet, or others.
Because what's written can lead to bad consequences even if it's done outside of the lab's routines."
"Inspired with the Arabic language"
So, Süden Pamir, who says we're going to be human, explains why, "Because all the sounds that you hear go into your brain.
Any person hears the sound of the concentration only, but other sounds are actually turning into the brain, and it leads to fatigue.
The brain needs to be emptied, so it's better to walk slowly in the field, walk through nature.
I think the rules should be set up to improve the flow in schools.
So the student only concentrates on the teacher's voice and can lead to longer concentration."
Pamir, who said that his prayers would be affected if he read from Arabic because of the features of his voice, notes that Arabic had a very rich frequency, and notes that when his words come to the end, the voices are arranged in a way that will leave a lot of real effects.
"But I need to read your prayers aloud, and when I read the life story, I'm going to have a cigarette cigarette."
Frequent love expression
The question is, "Is it possible to love a person with the frequency of sound?"
Don't love Pamir, and it's a frequency phrase to move the feelings of a more honest person: "You have to find the frequency of the pressure used when you're talking to someone you want to love first.
You can influence it by using a higher frequency in this frequency.
Let's think that the person for example has 300 press frequency.
And you want to play a music that will revive your feelings when you're with him.
If you're going to play music 300 times, you're going to be able to influence the person's ability to do two things when you get the power of those who have to do it alone.
Maybe that's how he loves the person he's got in front of him at the time."
Although there are special sound systems to be able to communicate with politicians in the world, the message is that when the bass voices are made up, the politicians can feel very strong, and a stage manufacturer can feel like a wonderful natural presence.
"You're trying to make a surreptitimous noise that is believed to be triggered by Michael on Thursday in Japan, how do you think this is going to happen?" And Pamir's answer is, "I think there's a voice near the human voice because the most powerful voice of man is near its own voice.
For example, what a wonderful thing is like a human being created out of the soul of man."
'He'll raise gold prices'
Canada Jennings Capital Inc.'s Chief Gold Analyst Dan Hrushewsky pointed out that the government's efforts to reduce debt by reducing the value of money banks would therefore raise its gold prices from the current level, saying, "The gold will continue to be a safe tool."
In the first half of the year of global demand under the most successful investment tool last week, Hrushewsky, China and India, who had been awarded a bid-related increase in the year, said, "The gold demand from China is rising in relation to India and Chinese investors play a major role in this."
"I believe that India is the largest gold buyer in the world as usual," Hrushewsky said, "and I believe that the government is no longer very proud of its involvement in managing gold bills.
People will find a way around this."
Hrushewsky, in his advice to investors to make long-term investments, will continue to serve with the role of a safe design tool.
Many U.S. governments forget the high levels of debt arising from the lack of discipline.
Governments are trying to reduce debt by reducing the value of money institutions.
That's why gold prices will rise from current levels."
"In a long line of gold, it's worth saving for the ability to reduce the risks of the market."
The World Gold Council Investment Council is General Manager Marcus Grubb, indicating that in the more complex and volatile financial markets where it goes, it is simply a physical existence that ensures that its characteristics are fairer and reliable, "if it does not fall in gold in the long run, it is good to know that the prevailing characteristics and market risks are better than the ability to reduce market risks.
The small quantities of gold portfolios proved to be much more stable and better to cope with market uncertainty."
Grubb, who pointed out that the demand for gold has risen in the last 10 years without stopping, said, "The gold represents less than 1 percent of the global investment.
This means that the market opportunities for growth in gold are still very important.
In this circle, over the past year, 78 percent of gold bars and strong slabs made of steel are evidence of the protection of the investor's interest in the below."
"India must increase its national gold stocks to support economic growth"
The world's largest gold market in India and China also contributed to the Grubb, which raised the demand for gold prices in the second quarter of the year, for silver, gold, and silk, which increased the investment industry in Asia.
Grubb, in the time of the word, reminded China that 54 percent of the demand for bribes has increased 51 percent in India.
Grubb, who wanted to bring down Chinese customers with low prices of gold and avantage, said: "The demand for Mücevher was generally a second half quiet.
After the gold prices fell unexpectedly, Nisanda lived up to her request and quickly dropped her bags."
In India, Grubb pointed out that in addition to the government's downgrading of gold deposits, India's Central Bank has taken a lot of initiative to support the decline and reduce temporary outputs, "The gold demand is as difficult as the conduct of the low-level applications and therefore can be met with insufficient channels.
The World Gold Council believes that India's policies should be seen as a strategic investment.
In addition, long-term policy objectives must increase national gold stocks in order to support economic growth in order to support long-term policy objectives."
Global Subroutines
According to the World Gold Council last week's report, in the second quarter of this year, the global gold requirement was 856.3 tonnes, global silver and steel gold investments were 508 tonnes.
In the second quarter of the year, while seeking an important increase in the country's demand for asylum, the demand for asylum rose by 54 percent in China, 51 percent in India, 38 percent in Turkey and 33 percent in the Middle East.
In the time of the word, the demand for tobacco in China continued to grow strong, and the demand for gold rose by 87 percent over the same year, with the expectation that the prices would increase in the future period, and this year's total reached 276 tons.
In India, however, the government has raised taxes in order to prevent the first gold-cool rise in India, but the demand for tobacco has increased by 71 per cent over the past year.
A short film of your Karaden: The Children of Tepen
Dr. Trabzon...
And the players are the most beautiful, beautiful, beautiful people of the Pacific village where the film was filmed...
Savda Serbest
There's only 400 thousand TL-butt film, lots of birthdays and coffee.
"We want to watch the story of a true Karaden of Karaden," the film "The Children of Tepen in 1980," which was released in the province of Ismet Eraydin, with love for the cinema, has been designed today to "we want to watch the story of a true Karaden."
The events of Akzaabat's film "Tepen's Children 1980" which was made on the Akkaabat's Christmas Island and all of the amateur players were also the result of some fun scenes such as the film itself.
The AVM Cinema Film Forum was an interesting experience for the press.
They signed a wonderful night with the Horonians and the Kurds of Karadens.
President Muhammad Balta, President of Trabzon Beledi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Culture and Tourism, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Rauf Sizesoy, President of Akzabat Beledi, and representatives of sponsors, national and local companies, were included.
In the film that Dr. Ismet Eraydyn wrote, film director Samet Karahanoğlu, Aishu Oztürk, Coral Koch, Salahttin Cakrur, Free Saral, Adam Erayun and Vahide Eryden shares.
The first time in Turkey, the children of Tepenin, who came to the scene with 61 copies, was used for the first time in Turkey to understand the Karadenis River better.
We're a shining star on the roof!
Samt Karahanoğlu is 18 years old.
You're looking for the best game name from Samt, who lives in Trabzon.
An amateur theater history player, comedian, and drama playing in the movie, succeeds.
Samt Karahanoğlu, who has deserved the awards to the end, has obtained the meaning of "will be one of the players to come" with the performance of his reign.
Come on, let's play together!
In Trabzon's Pacific Island, what happened in a time of work near 12th of September 1980 is about the film:
"The main character of my film is the work of young Hikmet's father in Germany.
It's one of Hikmet's greatest dreams of raising a shepherd in the months of his career, to be able to complete his studies and be a doctor.
It's not too much to read and work.
And it's hard work when you add to the love of Züleyha, the richest family in the village.
This love that he has hidden for years is in the presence of a powerful angel like the Lord of Sabri.
The patience Lord has other plans for his daughter.
And among the greatest obstacles are the Tupe which they have fought against the people of the valley.
Short film's a long metro...
Dr. Ismet, film senator and director of Gala, who drew a very small box from the Earth, made these comments about Tepen's Children in 1980:
"Our goal was to make a short film when this movie started.
But the images of the first drawings were so big in social media that we started to feel excited and excited to draw a long meter.
When we went to a division firm in Istanbul, they said, "Do we have a regular game?"
And I said, "We don't have a chance, but you can't find anywhere else, there's 86 Canadian games."
So far, many evil words have been used in films and shows and the Karadens have been misinformed.
You'll watch 86 original Karaden people in a movie that you'll watch.
I've been trying to shoot one of your Karadens.
I wish others were attracted to me and we were watching an endless comedy movie.
If you hadn't been misinformed, I wouldn't have caught this movie.
For the first time we wrote the Turkish film.
It'll be the first one.
We've done this to make your Karadens understand better.
We also wrote down the English language courses in the film and translated them into Karadenis.
When we turned the camera into this movie, the player came out.
We're the first movie to have the Children of Tepen.
My mistakes, my ex-girlfriends."
Don't miss this hot movie that brings a new light to your Karaden movies!
Be careful When Selecting your perfume!
Your personal appearance is superior to your appearance; even if you walk with perfume bottle in your hands.
The perfume you've used may be due to the diseases you've used.
We talked to Dr. Funda Ataman about the Civatte Poikiloder, the most common among women and the most common among perfumes from various cosmetics.
Dr. Ataman, who wants to know that the outer parts of the Civatte Poikiloderum are discoloration, which is seen in the sky and in the clouds (not to be seen in six areas where it is frozen), which is a discoloration.
The brown red is seen in the form of bread.
The date-palm shall be fresh and ripe, and the roots of the palm-trees shall be cut off.
Pulse is one of the options for laser treatment and sun protection.
The other is the use of creams containing retinoic acid.
These creams should be used for a long time.
There's no heat, no heat, no heat, no noise, no energy.
In this case, treatment should be continued on an interim basis.

He fell big on my cigarette.
In Turkey this year's first 6 months of smoking was reduced to 41 billion 779 million over the same period of the last year.
In Turkey this year's first 6 months of smoking was reduced to about 41,779 million 190 000,560 by the same time of last year.
According to information provided by the TAPDK, the Global Research for Adults in Turkey is completed to provide information on the full status of adults and to create a data source for decision makers and researchers in this regard.
As a result of the survey, in 2008, the population of 15 and above-year-olds in Turkey fell to 27.1 per cent in 2012 and the rate of use of the whole product decreased by 13.4 per cent in 2012.
He's using 41.5 percent of men, 13.1 percent of women.
And the number of people using the whole picture fell from 47.9 percent to 41.5 percent, and the percentage fell from 15.2 percent to 13.1 percent in women.
According to the study, he's planning to quit smoking 6 out of 10 people using the whole product.
The percentage of those who planned to leave the whole product in one month was defined as 35.4 per cent of those who planned to leave the product within 12.9 and 12 months.
The evaluation section of the survey took place at the following meetings:
"The net result of the impact of all products on the environment is to indicate that all control laws and the Universal Control Programme and Action Plan have been applied in Turkey.
In this regard, the number of people in the world has decreased by 2 billion in 2012 and increased by 4.1 percent, with the most significant proportions of young people and less educated people in tobacco use.
According to the 2013 World Health Organization Report, Turkey has become the first and only country to meet all criteria in terms of overall control.
In the report, the other countries wanted to follow Turkey and take the example."
The law of smoking continues to show its effect in closed areas.
In the first six months of this year, the amount of cigarettes consumed in the first half of the year, by the same period last year, amounted to between 10 and 41 billion 779 million 190 000 560.
This figure was found at 46 billion 325 million at the same time in 2012.
The walls are going to be a touch screen!
Ubi Interactive produced a very interesting product market using Microsoft's 'Kinect' technology.
Microsoft included 11 new Kinect Accelerator programs last year on support for projects to use Kinect in Windows.
My software show was supporting these companies with money, space, and hardware.
One of the most interesting software demos that ever appeared in the Kinect Accelerator was displayed by Ubi Interactive.
A demo sequencer comes in between Kinect for Windows and turns the project into a touch screen on the wall.
According to a new post from Kinect for Windows website, there are several companies that test this technology.
I'm writing the software that tested the institution on 50 in the private beta period, now it's being presented to everyone by Ubi.
It's possible to access the tickets from Ubi's website.
You need to pay 149 for a 45-inch touch screen.
If you have a 100-inch touch screen capable of touching from 20 points, you'll have $1,499.
Ubi's software and Kinect for Windows are only required to buy the projector separately.
Another news to Android!
This patent that Google has acquired will make it easier for you to 'take-off-to-file'.
Google, the first open-ended interface between mobile operating systems with Android, has received the patent of a new interface technology that will create a new interface for file sharing with friends.
The function of sharing in wireless technologies, such as NFS and Bluetooth, is not very different from Android Beam and Apple Airdrop.
The latest news that Google has sent is that this job is being distributed to groups around the world, instead of just once, to users.
It's like he's gonna take his place in future Android versions...
This is Turkey's first local smart phone.
Turkcell's got a smart phone job.
There's gonna be a smart phone factory in Turkey that's going to be involved with China.
Name and T40
Turkcell has identified Turkey's first local smart phone.
The TCELL design in Turkey and the intelligent phone to be produced in Turkey will eventually turn T40 into the market in July.
The Turkish General Manager of Syria Ciliv, developed with the US-based smoke producer Qualcomm, said they planned to launch a series of smart phone calls T40 in nine countries where Turkey's activity was demonstrated.
When Ciliv, who was a prominent actor in T40's run, said that they also met Turkish producers, he said, "T40's part will be in China; it will begin to be produced in Turkey in 2013 before the end of the year."
PORTRAITS FROM THE PAST
Ciliv, who said they're going to sell a fair with an appropriate phone call, said they're going to get close to the price chain.
Ciliv said he wanted to increase his use of data and increase his income by offering a more affordable price than selling a device with T40.
Ciliv, who said that Turkey's T series, which has been on the market since 2010, has sold 1 million copies of phone calls, indicated that these sales have attracted 500 million customers.
WAYS IN WHICH SOME CHOOSE TO PREACH
The Turkish General Manager of Syria Ciliv said there will be features such as T40's loud obstacle, high resolution voice, surround voice and adjustable user interface.
Ciliv said T40's price would be explained before the phone came to the market, and the phone price would be correct.
Every year, 5 billion dollars are spent in the field.
In saying that President Tayfun Acarer, the President of the Information Technology and Communication Organization (BTK), who held a meeting, supported the local production, "57% of the telephone calls to Turkey are smart.
The average price of the phones sold for this increase was $300.
We're always surprised by a $15 billion phone per year, and I'm worried that it's going to get more and more."
The Android operating system will have T40, Qualcomm paired processor and 1 GB RAM feature.
All of my priests are here!
Students' records of normal secondary school students have been updated as teachers in secondary schools
The MEB has become the primary, secondary and secondary school of all primary schools in Turkey in the year following the 4+4+4 reform of my education.
After a 1 year period of education, the re-enactment of a number of school students became the subject of a new scandal during the conversion process.
In Turkey this year, the "opportunity" of all schools that are held in the middle of this year was scheduled to take care of the students of all schools, during the conversion and registration processes in the Sheker Ortaokula, located in the heart of Meram of Konya.
1 year normal average
In the beginning of the last year after the 4+4+4 revision, the School of First School was converted into a middle school.
At school, students in the first three and fourth grade to be transferred to another school were studying with students in the sixth and seventh and eighth grade.
The school, which served as a normal secondary school for a period of 1 year, was converted into a high school environment at the end of the 2012-2013 school year.
I believe that this year, the first time in the fifth grade school, the student was adopted as a "tutor of education".
But last year's 5th grade was updated as an average student, and this year's 6th grade.
'Read otherwise than you don't want'
The bosses who learned about my condition became a prosecutor at school.
However, the school administration, in recognition of the instruction received from the Millennium Education Manager, said to parents, "The elders who don't want their children to continue as priests can take their records with another community."
The statement made by Konya Il-Millie Education Manager made some interesting statements.
He explained, "In view of the preferences of students and schools, we re-enacted some schools with the status of the Konya Valiggio, which included 15-20 schools in Konya.
Schools are entering the e-school system with school codes.
But my school teacher turns out to be an old school code removed from the system.
A new school code has to be signed by students in the system.
Those schools, as well as students of different schools, and teachers, were moved to the middle of the school using the new system code so that the students would not be deprived.
The parents who want to take their children out of these schools can take them to other schools."
It's a sleep operation in Istanbul!
160 million litres of 8 liters.
In Istanbul, the operation carried out by the gold team involved eight floors that were sold to another foreign country and had to not enter the gold sector in Turkey.
According to an explanation from the Gümück and Ticaret Bank, in an operation by the U.S. Department of Gümbul and Ticaret Region of Istanbul and the U.S. Sea of Gümpheza, the local Turkish citizen, U.E.A.A., was found to have received a transfer from the company in the name of the "repurchase" in Turkey.
After an investigation by the gold library, the U.S.A. was agreed to sell the beds in Turkey.
The service of bot, radar system, and generator, which was sold to another foreign country and which was supposed to be in Turkey for eight years, was addressed.
It was estimated that the total value of the motor beds in question was 160 million lira.
Metrobus woke up!
As you cross the street in the circus...
The metro bus that moved to the Avictors from the earthquake hit Yavuzcan Dulgun, who wanted to cross the road right away during the earthquake.
He's hit the ground with the impact of the attack.
The wounded Yavuzcan Dulgun was transferred to the University of Bezmial at the University of Applied Sciences.
Dulgun, who was taken to the hospital under treatment, was found to have no life-threatening risk.
On the other hand, he said you're late for your father's ambulance.
Police started a case investigation.

The family's request was rejected
BRANCH OFFICE / VIOLENT SIDES
The woman who opened the divorce case, who murdered 24-year-old Pınar Şahin, rejected the need for a lawyer who was convicted by Abbas Şahin, who was not a victim of violence.
Look at the 5th Injury Court, Abus Şahin, the mother of Pınar Şahin who was murdered, took part in the 2nd bid.
Judge Abbas Shahin has been sentenced to four pages in court.
"My wife asked for help with making me a new start.
He wanted me to keep the house where we found, but I didn't know where it was.
I took out my gun at my side, losing control.
This time, my wife's address was locked up.
He fired a gun by turning around the car.
My wife fell on my arm.
Then I took it to the police station.
I'm sorry."
