"Dear Münchnerin" 2018 will be!
On the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: they will be the romantic Candlelight Shooting in front of MY SOLARIS, not alone, but on the side of the Male Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirts, cocktails, conduct - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates are delivering the shooting with people photographer Tuan and despite wind, gas and rain as real professionals.
The romantic Shooting is in the video:
DFB Chief Grindel doesn't see any basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the National Mission.
"This is a question, of course, that one comes to talk to him once, that you also talk to him about why he's obviously found this one or other as it is in his state," said Grindel in the Football Podcast "Prasenmeher" of the "Image-Zietung.
Despite the monthly debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fashioned national player Özil.
"I would have liked if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I have also spent up to a certain point of time that would be so," Grindel said.
The 29-year-olds had explained his resignation from the DFB team in July and also reasoned that he had not been protected from racist attacks during the WM.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism to Özil that this was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Lwö and teammate Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knew it from the football, so that if "you leave a man or change a union to talk to his trainer about it and I find it bad that this conversation has not been possible before."
Linz: Garden huts in Schrebergertentensigung burned
At 14.13 p.m., Linz was alarmed at a fire in the Enerrhofway.
Because a high voltage led directly through the Schrebergertentenstation, there was a risk of neglect.
The occupational fire broke out and found the houses in full fire.
The roof had to be removed virtually to the ends and fire protection had to be extended to the required extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden, he had found an akuku to be loaded on Wednesday.
That could be the brandur thing.
In any case, the loading device is based on fire-fighting in the area of maximum fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be identified as well as the fire cause.
However, it must be significant because the owner had many pieces in his garden.
Old Mother Returns: Lindsay Lohan is a refugee family on open street
What has Lindsay Lohan sold to this extremely remarkable action?
She wanted an alleged refugee family to bring the children in.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Full Loaded") has made it possible to live as a family in Moscow apparently wants the children to attend.
It reports the US-Portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "To be happy" with Lindsay Lohan
In the Clip is to see how Lohan grows out of a car and is going to a potentially undiscovered family that wants to be raised as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family moves right in front of the actor, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She is concerned about the sale of children to adults.
For all of this, it does not provide any evidence in the Clip.
"The whole world sees it right," is Lohan in the video how she continues to follow the family along the road.
Obviously, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At times, however, it seems that the apparently angry mother is enough.
It looks like she's turning around and lohan's missing a watch.
Under trains, the actor means how shocked she is - and she keeps her voice.
What Lohan has moved to this action is now completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe began in December 2014 in Japan.
She should be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that she can clean up material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The "Mascot" country will remain on Ryugu.

Elon Musk returns as Tesla Supervisor
At first it was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk provided August for disturbances in the stock markets when he announced a return from the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. survey accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla Chief is returning from the Board of Supervisors, but he may remain president.

Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Development Board Peter Mertens to the "Automobile Week".
The arrested and authorized Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, it is expected that all motor/power combinations have been tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "In the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage in the reconstruction of the diesel crisis.
We have concluded the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel Canal at the Audi-Mutter Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder had made "gravitational organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board had rejected a decision on the future of Stadlers and wanted to continue its discussion on this Tuesday.
The authorities of the investigation shall propose to the Court of Auditors to allow the sale of this car with false value.

Baseline pursues re-election - Lahm to be in the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, in spite of the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil affair next year, wants to apply again for the office as DFB President.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning in the "Current Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again, and I'll do it.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
According to his own words, the Head of Defence would be "marked" if he did not, according to the Appendix for the Football-EM 2024, "Listen to working on the future project".
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach since April 2016.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for the first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB Bundesag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Cheforganiser Philipp Lahm will work on the basis of the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role, he would also talk to the Bureau in the future and then, of course, be invited to make his experience available on sports issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation whether his successor could become a DFB chief.
As a consequence of the campaign about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkaya Gündogan, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, expressed the desire that in the future a national player should become a DFB integration message without a migration background.
At present, this office of the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a non-Migrating background has a significant impact on society and football and says "the topic is important, because we need to take care of it", it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our unity in a place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

The Braunschweider, with which NBA Star Dennis Schröder has been most relevant since the beginning of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Basket quickly provided for clear relationships.
Opened yesterday in Koln
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Dibib-Moschee in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Critics and Germany
In his opening address, Erdoğan called on the German Government to deliver the remaining hostages of the Golden Movement in Germany and to appeal against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not be allowed to torture our citizens and damage the German-Turkey friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Dibib-Mosche, the Kolner Innstadt was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were also in use - under them.
The Dibib Islamic Union is in crisis because it is considered to be the longer-term arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and second season
Musicaries such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert in New York Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Accommodating you where you can always be," Mendes said at the festival in the evening on Sunday before around 60.0000 visitors.
Thanks for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B plays in a red outfit with French and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm nervous, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Players such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed themselves at the multi-threaded show on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a second time when many viewers held the noise of a falling metal stop for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Soon panic broke out, people ran through each other.
Seven visitors were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin, however, relieved the people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt someone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available as free every year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to create a teacher had to read and spread on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, it was given by the public Jubel and Applaus - Buhrufe, on the contrary, to the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
However, this spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons at the stage for more equal rights of men and women.
On Friday, however, the U.S. Senate Justice Committee spoke on behalf of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and, as a result, arrested many women in front of the head.
At least three women have resorted to abuses until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which is returned.
Flake asked for a FBI investigation of the grounds, after which two women, who had experienced their own sexual abuses themselves, were confronted on the way to the Committee's meeting in a raise.
"You may also like to meet with me at any time in a ride," Fleke now said to the audience at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government protects the media
Government spokesman Stepen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist at the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German title "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-Shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
There was a interruption of the press conference.
The journalist's action would have created a strong disturbance, which would not have been acceptable.
That's why he ordered that personal defenders bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political cases at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor.
This is entirely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate case.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are subject to spy activities or support or membership in banned parties or the fethullah-guilles movement.
The Turkish leadership shall be responsible for the movement of the broken pipe test on 15 July 2016.
Some of the journalists charged have spent several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not sure of the Turkish authorities: In early September, Austrian journalist Max Zircast was arrested.
Finally, the cases of the arrested journalists Meshale Tolu and Deniz Yücel were taken care of.
However, they were free to return to Germany, but still still running processes against the two of them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drink completely with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and pleasantly: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, this is truly Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for its warm conversation at the Theke of the Hamburg port button "Schelt Fish Posts".
Moderator Ina Müller invites her guests to some beer, some wine or even high-percent drinks to raise the voices and sounds.
Not a few promises are also being made for the mandatory singing equipment.
On Friday another result of the popular talkshow was recorded.
This time: actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Manherzens", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Last Day".
The Münchner was able to travel in the high north, but it was not good enough.
On Saturday he posted a suicide - his face is completely used for it, the eyes are only two small pieces.
The bet-selfie shows a completely detached Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's only got a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some – perhaps not very serious – findings he has now gained: "Regular one: does NOT go to Inas night.
Rule two: don't drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round iron lamp, which weighs about three-thirds of it, is let go.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the 43s.
His fans also put a few tips to fight the waves.
You may want to get rid of instant breakes, fish breakes or - possibly the most target - headache tablets.
Others simply expressed themselves about the appearance of the normally attractive cinemastar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night's drying plant, it is not yet known.
But since it's modernised the TV space on the screen since 2007, the 53-year-olds seem to be significantly more...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight Vandalism and Unrat
The entrance to the 36 km long railway route in Treysa in Treysa is hard to find and tired.
Recipes against fating vandalism are sought, but solutions are rarely mentioned.
Squires, cigarettes, powder and unrat, demolitioned mills and medium-decomposed hints - thus present themselves from the long-standing entrance with a seating group to the railway on the seabed in Treysa.
For the preview, the railway route in Rotkäpchenland is more than an inadvertent view.
The theme is the work of members of the ADFC Orts Group Schwalmstadt, but also of others already, such as the city's railway officer Ulrich Würstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the railway sector.
There's no solution until then.
The proposals range from the creation of the sitting group to regular disposal of waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entrance point.
"I think the last time would be the offer of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Whistenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the area.
Not only does the mill drive drivers and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for the weekend.
Not only is it often heard, when the plants are destroyed, but it is also destroyed: dusting from the ground, demolitioned molluscs, painted walls, damaged seat furniture.
Volunteers have already become more popular, told ADFC member Susanne Klipper.
However, the actions were only the spore-worded troops on the hot stone.
They are afraid that the seating place on the road in Treysa is a meeting point for shipping facilities.
"At the end of the entire railway journey, there is clearly the focus of the Haaße-Hügel," confirmed the railway crew, who is now also taking care of the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"It leads to the same fate, it's going to be really expensive."
Another idea would be a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that makes the shoe much higher to fit together.
However, this would provide that a police station will soon take place.
In principle, deserthagen wants to develop the haaße hill.
It must be designed more attractive.
To date, the frequency of driving can be very satisfactory.
The tourist marketing is still reliable.
Our route is very high in comparison to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard situation, ADFC member Susanne Clippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There's no escape on the Haaße hill.
In the course of traffic, it may happen that drivers have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-sided traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but perhaps for older people and especially for children.
Music-Contest in the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Sea
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in the middle.
"D a song for Hiltrup," says the call of the city hallofensive Hiltrup, in the "Music content for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye flaws in the sympathic Hiltruper Family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family partner with coffee and kitchens from the honourable members of the cultural center.
Seven formations take place, from the one-man band to the great Ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup living albachers, the nine members of the "Hiltruper Star colours", three members and three generations of the family Trekamp and Claus, a collection from the children's garden Lummerland and including rich Weßling and the Blacks.
This contest, declared by district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't experienced that in other parts of the city yet.
Where did the texts come from?
The Hiltruper Sea and the market hall were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig called all of them in his victory song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Cultural Station has also been awarded.
It was always about the experience of each other at these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived with short interviews with interpreters or references to their creation.
So it's been learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he's teaching guitars too.
Franke, from Tontechnique Stefan Schemmelmann, knew that he was in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvey in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all of his hands on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, for the interests of the jury there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianoist Marcel Untied with tontechnicer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can include a song: Immi along with his Hiltrup-Schlager, Frank particularly impressed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two teachers at guitar and Cajon, Laura Castner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of the children at the end of the day - and even sounds without electronic support "very good", as Franke said.
The jury was led by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Western School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Union, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the city centre.
The city scene had called the event from the time of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
For each page there is a view screen, in which four cards with keywords that you can extract - the old trick with the red foil - only if you have attached it.
It is thus ensured that the opposite side cannot read anything from sight.
On the map, for example, you can read from the left to the right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Wurfle.
"Fest 4"
These are the terms that are still valid.
Because the terms should not be mentioned here, but codes.
Differently a player per team is the key player.
He gets a code card, which may be "3.4.2".
Questions should be asked in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the cover, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe, in this series and in this example, the terms "wurf", "Fest" and "window" - and although his own team recognises the correct sequences and does not enable the opposite team; for this will win the party if it reaches him twice to break the code.
So the locker notes and reads: "Wolves" for the storm, "Loss" as opposed to attachment; of course, there would also be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has adapted to the school and knows the window noise.
That's how it goes for rounds, team for team.
Although you do not know the concepts of the opposite, this can be better combined with any indication the key is there.
It may be mysterious, but it should not be too hard for the conversions to be so, otherwise it would be unnecessary for his team.
The most encrypted 'decrypto' is the rulehead.
Players may need to study it for a very long and thorough time until they are finally able to play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling is involved in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as crucial as predecessors and generic primus "Codenames", which also silences an agent thematic on a game of less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about advice and not about winning points, who can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: A man shows the police Hitler size and hires guests in the knife
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach on Saturday night on Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler scale in the city of the Upper, and later he also appeared in the upper city in a button when he hired other guests.
After clearly alcoholizing the assigned place by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulbbach police station in the port cell.
In the next state, he must also be responsible for the use of symbols of non-conforming organisations.
Business Press was home of Schublok
The railway work in Pressig has been the shipyard in Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When buffers hit the buffer, it was heard in all precision," recalls George Dinkel, who archivaled the history of the place and the railway station.
No one's right.
Then the brakes also stopped and the wagons stopped.
That was just a train.
Expressions that are figurative for the Dinkels Homeat Pressig.
Nowhere in Frankenwald was such a place by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the stylampen mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres, has its sleigh point in Steinbach at the forest.
In order to handle this, early training and schubloks were needed, which had their home in Pressi.
In 1901, the Bavarian landday approved the construction of a railway station with 21 ski lifts, train stations, driving and trainmasters.
"Herzstück was the shipwright who had a diameter of 18 metres after a building in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of career trainer.
The railway work (BW) Pressig, which was submitted to Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the nearby Presig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockholm - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a staff of 160 men; 13 bombings and eight Ellocks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electricalization of the line in 1939 has already minimised the need for training and training.
Since 1977 they have been used only for goods.
By 1991 at least 10,000 roads were repaired.
In 1982, parts of the work were canceled in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not made better use of the place, even in puncto freight, in your eyes."
Even at Pfingsten 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directive celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig for the "50-year electricization Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 interested visitors here," recalls George Dinkel.
A little later on, the exit.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were taken away, the Ranger Station Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Home Schoolers did the most difficult work in train transport," recalls Dinkle.
Every failure had fatal consequences.
Why the Presig Rothenkirchen train station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and many more historical and current images are available here in the French Plus article.
Kerber with recording at China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledonsigerin Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegendund have reached the second round at the Tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Christina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World's Third List is Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
In turn, 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, as the Russian mentioned at number 13.
The Schwwabin is now able to do it with an Internet account from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened on the weekend in the "Art and Benefits" series.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Dahlmann-Smidt, midway bank, opened in the free country of the existence of Dahlmann-Smidt, the special Vernissage "Windsgamel-Performance".
It is located under the roof of the "Rund about Walberla" in the "Art and Gains" series.
This opened their ports in the 15th year.
A large demand for visitors showed the excitement of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in the middle of the year.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists for opening the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who also made a name as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprised, but a few days ago, Hahn announced his return.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his job in a secure, young hands with a good future.
Both in the past have been actively involved in the selection of artists and have worked with Flyer.
In this year there is also one of the 70 cent special brands of art & benefits, available at each art station.
There you can also acquire this year's poster "Betsn austen", by Volker Hahn, for eight euros.
He was pleased with the high claim of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical rehearsal.
On the way through the large garden, it becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windsgamel performance" formally calls for the artistic imagination and ultimately brings to the express.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often with colorful accents.
On the right hand side of the "Happy Tree" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a wooden drum, colored, playful with 20 windmills, 24 lifts and 24 alu pipes as soundpieces.
With the sun that is passing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems to melt and invites it to rest.
From the Eckental, Barbara Waschneck, who prefers the event in three-dimensional letters K&G.
There are many parts in the wind moving.
In half of the street, Siegrid Frey from Eckental published her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his beautiful fantasy image of Ton, cement and precious steel.
The theme "Windsgamel performance" was introduced to scalding through the diverse art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018 the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albums: Singers celebrate 50. Birthday fixed
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the albatross also made their barren air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out in detail that after the resolution of the Church Church Church "Cécilia" there should be no more life in the city.
It has become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they pick up the MGV 68 albums from the pool.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated great in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," said President Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests had a real success for the Albanian singer.
They had left the foundation party alone for the Jubilee.
It's been a tradition for years, and it's been a break for the first time.
At the time of the 50-year-old age, the tradition party was back there.
An elegant ball was said to have been prayed for solid clothing before.

The climber is ticking.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Monster under the control of Axel Büring is located right in Liga three.
No traces of chess or francs, the independent do their thing.
And that's at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee right.
"That wasn't clear, but we've already left impressions," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately pointed out: "This is a disaster with which we can live very well.
We're not unhappy." On the contrary.
At night at a night birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game turned off.
Yes, the result is actually an optical distortion.
In the third set, the guests had a satzball.
"If they bring it to the goal, then a game can kick once," says Bürring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine powers, made everything clear and brought the full performance into focus.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't make us the genius.
I've seen very well volleyball at the stage," Annacker didn't have the 0:3 and went around the agenda.
Where the journey is going for the independent, it does not seem to be visible after just three days of play.
"It's just too early," says Axel Büring.
He just feels like, "The 3rd League has an incredible good level.
With regional league volleyball, this is not nearly comparable."In the fourth league, they do not want to turn their view any further down.
If the West is not contaminated in the coming weeks, they have to look up.

About her marriage to Hans of Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship Heide Keller became the star.
Now she openly says that the series may have been guilty of her marriage with Hans of Borsody.
Her role of Ledebur's Chiefhostes Beatrice was celebrated by Heide Keller (76), but on January 1, 2018 she was always on board.
The series that they are leaving at the start could be responsible for their divorced marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which they had been married for ten years.
"That could also be a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my wonderful colleagues took me to the height of truth," says Keller in the conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
First of all, she had always been "the woman of Hans von Borsody" but that had changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists are calling only at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he likes it so well."
She thinks that she might have been desperate for her husband at that time, but "as many men also missed his talk about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans by Borsody and he wanted to know my anxiety, my weaknesses.
That is well known in Germany: I've succeeded," she further explained.
She's always had the feeling, "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I had never been in the truth, even though I sometimes looked happy and courageous at the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously divorced marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said again yes, "though I was afraid that it could also be a second time."
On the day before the full-scale trauma, I was standing in the garden and wanted to say everything.
The marriage also broke up with Borsody.
Why haven't you been with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller showed himself to love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I'm too naive to get to love."
The nightfall, which regularly explores the night of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has this time been waiting for the ZFF opening party.
Our missing is not a reward, but a little light.
And the green glass, in which a green carpet is covered on the sixth floor, shines over the fee.
But it's a long film festival, because more or less famous people want to sing in the film industry.
In this late Thursday afternoon, he breaks over the place to make himself easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase" soon.
The public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates their premiums at the festival, are called: The necessary facilities in the party of a new Pavillon, there is a lot of power to promote a luxurious environment.
This evening, however, the Lord-Oase is silent for some reason to heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the street: allowed guests who have just held at a certain level in the cinema next to the opening movie "Green Book" celebrate the festival with a party in the three-siding shop each year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all over the earth the displayed works are known .
What must be done with an article on this festival not to fall into bad practice for 190 partner companies.
The falcon binds itself with a bandage around the sensor that has attached a good fee to him, and two bunny twersters actually sell it to him.
Inside, they dance long after midnight to live music or let themselves be introduced by DJ rhythms, where they shout at each other, and play with Cülip exquisite harps below.
In the delicate landscape in Southern Australia, Austria is waiting for smelting mites, along with the uneven roses of Culatello di Zibello will be frozen freshly, and a chocolate burn will be sprayed.
And the hammer is: All the sales regals are completely exclusive products have not been expanded for the occasion.
That's how it's been for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The Faller studies the painting at the roletrack: "Take a long dress, please be careful about the roletrack".
If the two separate instructions were to be, he would have left in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it's probably saved lives.
In the department of the household in Oberskoss, the pilots pick up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", corresponding to the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily obtained by this mix, with which a capseller presents himself.
And George Clooney, who has been born for years for the sake of the mark, is not here at night either.
However, between local promenade, casinos and kitchen articles, there is a face that is familiar to the viewer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It should not be far away from its main representative.
And really: Equally, Viggo Mortensen spreads, with soon almost six times as close as a chorknabe, through the crowd.
He won't get caught, he won't get caught, he won't be shot at at at the top.
Just for this back-up, which likes to be misunderstood as a misunderstanding, international stars love this film festival.

Handball: Contiguous League 1: ASV Send to Last Minute Pleite "on the ground destroyed"
Sven Bieltzki, Coach of the ASV Handball Binding Lists, was hardly able to get it: "So a bit lower." His supporters were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday at LIT Germany 2.
They didn't play bad over long stages, like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst.
Only the beginning phase "we all fell asleep", the U.S. trainer complained.
The housekeepers quickly led by 8:1, even the early hours that had taken the Bieletzki, did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a rush went through the team," Bieltzki decided the second quarter hour together.
For a break, the stand was only two more towers.
In particular, the best messenger, Marius Hintze, met again in the phase.
After the change, it was even better from visiting.
After 33 minutes David Ernst looked out at 15:15, followed by the staphyliser almost passed.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the premier still seemed to be resting three times (29:26).
And then?
Get the unparticipated ones into the case.
Bieletzki, of course, should be looking for the blame for others.
But: The 120-second penalty, the Stephen Mühlhoff cast, "was a white".
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - during the decaded US also broke up in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, they've also been good at seven men and they've thrown back on the empty door.
Only they can buy little for the supplements.
"Now there must be a fucking victory here," said the restless Bieletzki.

Bayern: woman has been missing for 30 years - Police robs by leases

Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the state administration, has been working to re-intensively on the case.

The results of the recordings should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are taking place on the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letters, users should use more passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should not be sufficiently installed, nor would it be harmful to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of Tesla's electric car manufacturer, has died as head of the billions of heavy companies.
He and the U.S.B.S.A.S.S.C.A. have rightly contributed to a legal dispute over unreported Twitter messages in which Musk could lose the permission to lead marketed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay every 20 million dollars, in addition, for three years Musk gives the Chairman's office a comparable position to the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain against him.
In comparison, which is still to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla had any lack of conduct.
The SEC accused the world-famous manager of the US Federal Court of Justice Manhattan of fraud.
Musk, also owned by the World SpaceX company, is the public face of the lost electric car pioneer, who is assessed between the pool with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not guilty of any guilt
Musk made it clear that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always dealt with truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter clients, he would probably take the company from the bank and pay $420 per share, which would guarantee funding.
It would be estimated that Tesla would total 72 billion dollars.
Later, the music returned: Tesla stayed at the bar.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find one from outside Chairman, two independent board members, and also a committee that monitors the communication.

Shortly before the end, storm solved the talks with a sludge in the corner.
Rector Manchester United has been resting after the worst season since 1989, ever deeper into the crisis.
The man of the conflicting trainer José Mourinho lost at West Ham United worth 1:3 (0:2) and remains ten points after seven days only in the table field.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to rise in front of the Champions League match on Tuesday against the FC Valencia.
The former Leverkusen-Torhüter Bernd Leno came after a defeat by Petr Cech to his first Premier League.

Questions: 46% don't want Markel until 2021 as a Chancellor
Following the rounds of last week, the Groko casts several questions deep down.
The SPD falls into a question behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD in the Emnid Sunday beach for the image on Sunday for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD is placed at 17 per cent, the SPD has a point in comparison with the previous week and is a 16 per cent country.
CDU and CSU also lose a figure and only 27 percent.
This is the most profound value for the Union in the Sunset.
The greens reach 15 percent, the links 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
On Sunday the federal election, the government parties would receive SPD, CDU and CSU according to Emnid, only 43% of the votes.
As a result, the great coalition has now lost the majority of all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, in the matter of Sunday.
The government parties come from 43 to 45 per cent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
At the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 per cent more.
In the other parties, the band size is also large: The AfD, in several questions, is the second most powerful party, is between 15 and 18 per cent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17%.
The left is at average 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such questions have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent above and below each vote.
However, the return to the population of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also been very low since the federal elections in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellor, as the Emnid survey found in the BamS order.
Only every second (50 per cent) wants the survey to date that the big coalition will hold up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 per cent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were significant popularity surveys for brands.
The Germans also consider whether Markel should apply for the CDU presidency again in December.
47 percent are said to be Emnide, 44 percent are against it.
In the case of Union citizens, 64% therefore want a candidate, not 35%.

Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that in Tinder's times there is no romantic knowing stories anymore - who should be kept at Aldi once over powdered meat.
Munich - During the digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the Supermarket looks like a place of familiarity for the great love almost anachronistic novelty.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced powder meat, boxershort buttons on the toilet or the favorites-pudding is still a better story for the later single children than a single squipe to the right.

For her belief in the magic of the analog student, she deserved her happiness End à la Hollywood anyway.

Wolbeck had significantly more toys in the first section.
And Chance.
But Frerichs before his exit (17) who changed Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38).
It would have been a good time when the SCA in minute 41 was twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberblumer, dangerously exposed to the Wolbecker Castle - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his case.
After the break, the VfL gladly took full control.
Theves, 18 meters apart.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare enterprise
Only 8 per cent of the presidents were present on Friday, 1 September, as presented in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented on this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented by the German Press Agency.
"Companys will have to be set up differently, otherwise international competitors will go ahead with them," said Wiebke Ankersen, director of the Foundation.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-owned leadership groups - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The return makes German competitors less numerous, less innovative and more focused on the future.
It's another business culture.
In addition, the small increase in the share of women among the German mining companies would be based solely on positive incentives in the index of the average value (MDax).
However, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the presidents are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 per cent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years, women's share has increased.
Last worked 26 women in the presidents.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had indicated that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of the "zero percent" until.
Another picture takes place at the supervisory offices: On September 1, there was a woman's share of 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"A similar number of women were recruited annually for the presidents, a proportion of 40 per cent would have been achieved in the year 2023," says the report.
Some even make mice: Luxury Cars: Which manufacturer deserves most of the car?
We're best worth Ferrari.

Large cars, great profits: This slogan applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble suppliers makes most of the profits per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers buy by car?
With this question, "Autopapst" and Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have worked.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made in the first half year with every car sold 69,000 euros - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley were able to drive in each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well earned in the race with prices ranging from €33,000 to €38,000 per car and around €3,000 before interest and taxes EBIT.

A notary vehicle is severely damaged along a road.
A 27-year-old passenger has been killed in the collision of the vehicle with a taxi.
When notaries are called, they will help - best to save the lives of people.
Such a rescue took place in Bonn, a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn when a car was hit by a taxi.
The taxi drivers, the notaries and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the Notarztato had passed a red apple on Saturday afternoon with blue and Martinshorn.
Then he sat on a cross with the taxi that ran at Green.
After the collition, the doctor pushed against an apple masquerade and a tree.
That's what he found out about the passenger who died in the accident.
Motor vehicle driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the notary vehicle were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from use forces.
The 29-year-old Notarsttin who was also severely injured was able to free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help them.
Another re-enacted Notarzt tried this, however, without success.
The three severe injuries were carried into hospitals.
The police are in a position to agree with the Bonner State Service, who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the flashing out of the league, Manchester United is now lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is ManU 1:3. The type and manner of the landing should still be discussed.
The scene was figuratively in the 74. minutes in which the repeated Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot at 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had brought Red Devils back to the game.
Since they were tired of an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's playmates remained, and Arnautovic read all the time of the world, the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative height of an already overexhaustible performance.
It is quite different today with the Uniteds Citytrival Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos, the great competitor of Pep Guardiola, came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an uninterrupted 2:0 victory.
After a half hour, Raheem Sterling first crossed the border of the outside team.
Sergio Aguero provided a good hour and a double pass with the pre-filled torpedo to secure the sixth victory in the seventh game, as well as for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 landing in Ligacup, Xerdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As at Cup-Aus, Belgium was the best man in London.
The experience of the 27-year-old in the 25. minutes remained until the final phase of the single match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in 66. minutes for Mohamed Salah, passed the comparison almost 70 minutes.
It was better for Daniel Sturridge in the 89. minutes with his sludger.
So, after the talks started with an endless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and through the remiss in the League, the Blues Liverpool was still the tablepiece.
Like City, both London City Clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0-wine.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granite Xhaka played, however, had to be patient with the surprise team from Hertfordshire Counties until 81. minutes on a success message.
Nine minutes before the closing, Craig Cathcart, a lawyer named Alex Iwobi, failed to enter his own door, but only two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third season event for the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory following Watford, is just right behind the great Rivalen Tottenham at rank 5. A strong impression is still left under the rise of Volverhamton under his Portuguese trainer Spirito Santo.
The Wolves remained at 2:0 against Southampton in the League for the fifth time in pursuit of the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Automobile salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Car Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially, there is no topic and yet present: The diesel channel and the rail line for road bans and equipment should also not be released by the German car companies at industry meetings in Paris.
At the 2018 Car Salon, they show their news from next week, together with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and post-shipment offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be dealt with by the government in Berlin, must still be an important subject at least behind the brilliant cults of the exhibitions.
A large name is missing in Paris: People's cars are with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: The E-tron of Ingol cities is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially presented, but both were already present.
The iNext of BMW should start only 2021.
The new 3 is in the centre of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented in this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorists as well as numerous mobility and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates this year’s 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors arrived.
At the severe earthquake and the next tsunami, at least 380 people were on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injuries.
On Friday, the island was struck by two earthquakes.
The first bee had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, causing enormous damage.
After the bees the Tsunami brought over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the charges still go significantly high.
The numbers are only from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other communities - along the Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 Bikers Celebrating God’s Service in Verdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service on Sunday with an auxiliary team for the motorcycle driver in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The place before the peace church in Eveking included the motorists on Sunday.
The final award service for the bikers was always on the program.
Frank Schröder is the Motor Pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is responsible for the soul-surgery benefits of the strong PS drivers.
Between April and September, the last Sunday of a month of the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) will be held at the house of Nordhelle.
At the end of the season, the Biker traditionally celebrates in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to attend one other than regular service.
For 10 hours, the Bolides had been running before the church's entrance port.
First of all, the Biker breakfasts stood on the program and had to be strengthened with coffee and kitchens or with a firm course.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders were also a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The preaching took place during the Bicker Goods Service of Pfarres Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwriterin Valerie Lill provided for the musical interpretation.
"While the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetic-study tone," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Homeatverein celebrates great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple juices.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also developed a great interest.
He had his appelpresses in the package and demonstrated his standing audience step by step the process from the apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children in the field, they filled the apples in the big bushes.
With a little muscle strength, a fine narrowed mass was formed from the apples.
Many of the children were still unable to imagine how this should be a tasteful drink.
However, they were also able to see this important step of work on this late Friday.
In forms packed and filled with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stuck the layer of a small piece of paper for each other.
With some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran back and forth into a big fan.
However, the farmer had already completed specifics.
So he opened his "schatzkist" and presented the older visitors with the latest federal whites.
The demand for the good troupe "Made in Füchtorf" was quite great.
In a friendly atmosphere, the parents arrived in conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the appelpress process, but also the built-in hippfburg for themselves.
The Füchtorfer's active cameradity of former soldiers also engaged in the party and played at some stations to play short-term games.
In the coming year, the homeowner will also be offered a day of action.
Then, however, as Gregor Krütz battled, the house will not be in the heart of the spargel village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the topic on hand: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season: "Best situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga Nieldellage, the trainer André Breiterreiter gathered his distinguished profession from Hannover 96 to speak to them with courage.
However, there were many positives to see at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Frankfurt entry.
"It's a complicated situation, but you have to get out of there as a man," said 96-footed professor Primin Schwegler, and said, "That's kind of amazing, because you're always taking a lot ahead of yourself."
The further silent Dutchs, for whom only Florent Muslija (86) came into contact, are with two figures all the way down and are a candidate for a rise in their current constitution.
Indicted by the amazing Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season of the season.
Evan Oite Indicka in the 36 minutes, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) made 46,300 visitors to the DFB-pocalyptic winner who, following the successful overall test for the European League game against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice-Montenegro Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of horses at its launch site and was never caught by Hannover Abwehr.
After the WM, the long-acted stormer showed his time and resources why he is so valuable for the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan FC Liverpool was the first time in the early formation of Frankfurter, which began to sink.
Lucas Torró (17) was the first time in danger.
Six minutes later, Sebastien Haller was stopped in a positive position at the last moment from the 96th round of the Brazilian flag, which replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership of the housekeepers was almost compulsory and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic held the ball after a failed corner in the yard, Haller extended by head before the door where Dicka just needed to keep his foot.
It was the first federal event for the French double-lister AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still waiting for the break.
This time, Haller passed on his storm partner Rebic, who was able to think of himself, and Michael Esser left no chance.
In the mid-term Hannover-Coach responded to the weak image of his elephant and brought to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
However, the Dutch people were now playing a little braver after the beginning, but the current ideas remained until the end, as the arrival of the arrival victim.
The horses were much more efficient.
After about an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it on De Guzmán, who had to shoot the ball only into an empty tower.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against the overrun guests just for a walk, and Jovic was a minute before the end.
The Morlaix place is going to party
Despite cold temperatures, the best vote was won at the city's October festival.
The Münchener Oberbürger Master Dieter Reiter created it before the opening of the 185 million.
München Wies'n in the last week with two strokes.
Christmas: Celebration of the Holy Cross
The Gesing Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or Sunday.
The party service is held in the city church, and then a process for the Holy Cross church is completed with the end of the season.
The Church of Saint Creuz hosts the slain Christ, who is from the 30th century war and who has been shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flow out of the shell.
This led to a great march to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the altarroom stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, trust and life.
The service of God was bad in spite of the importance of the dangerous horses.
After the service of God, the process of the Holy Cross took place, and with the end of the season ended the church part of the cross.
For many years, the Catholic Church has been invited to become a part of the festival in the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with delicious meals, as well as a large selection of kitchens and the weather, a farm hall.
On the afternoon, the Pfarrm municipality is still running around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmidt-Seger informed visitors about the damages to fassad, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the ongoing construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the plague has been in place for some time, the damages could be clearly identified and the individual statements could be prepared more precisely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, as the damages already existed a few years ago have become greater, but it has also been more determined, which has only been made possible through the introduction of equipment.
Sockeler's work is finished, before winter is to begin with natural works, and it is still hoped that half of these work can be completed this year.
Accommodation: New apartment in the New Ulmer Münsterbrickstraße
The life assistance of Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münster Beach.
That "a very special house" will now be handed over in the Münster-Straße - because all the residents were pleased at the time of accession.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the home of the Lifehelp Donau-Iller have been living for some time on the special architecture of the new building.
Greater walks, flowers and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army official building was set up on the site for residents with phonecap: "The house had arrived in the years and no longer in the equipment", Bader said in retrospectively.
In 2016 the baggage returned to rent the house.
The Neubaua should be designed as friendly and as light as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, such as the architect.
Life-help Donau-Iller opens new residence
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in the Neubau.
The Free State managed EUR 2.4 million, the area of Swaben EUR 450000.
The construction works are based on architecture Bader in the planned framework - both timely and financial.
He also thanked him for his life assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat was not always easy between a barrier-free and simultaneously fireproof construction.
Nevertheless, the planners and manual workers had built a home with many purposes, which allowed the inhabitants to experience freedom, even without foreign aid.
Similarly, the director of the social administration of the province of Swaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house focuses on the special needs of its inhabitants, who need the resources to be mobile."
If the apartment and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The reason in this situation is a real accident, because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation."
In total, the new residence in the Münster view street offers approximately 1500 square meters space for 30 disabled people, divided into three housing groups.
Stolz is the lead manager of Lifeshilfe Heinz on the eleven full-time forces that have been appointed at all.
Germany: Switzerland regrets differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unity, the Vice-President of the SPD-Bundeswisig, Manuela Schwesig, called on all the people of the country not to be found with the participation of East Germany.
There are differences that affect units after almost 30 years.
With these differences we cannot satisfy ourselves," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day show on Sunday".
The aim must be to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It would be unacceptable for East Germans to work longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after the German Unit," said Switzerland.
North Korea: Does this filthy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhun is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax the relations with Seoul, Pjungjang gave the South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungsan-Jangdungs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two dogs had reached their recipients about a year ago on Thursday.
They then traveled to the Panmunjum border with three kilograms of dog feed to "encourage the animals".
The dogs with the thick white field, thick ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national culture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The company had announced to the north at the third summit this year between the moon and the North Korean army chief Kim Jong Un mid-September in Pjungjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions, such as the Olympic Games 2020, and to compete together in the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the opposite approach, Kim also wanted to close the test facility Tongchang Ri for rocket launch.
History moved by Austria in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this year of the Memorial, many new books have appeared that have been answered mostly over the past hundred years.
On the other hand, Wolfgang Maderthan, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, is presented in the famous "Image Book" of Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new chance for government
Back to work - this is how the informal motto for the work week of the Great Coalition begins today.
Almost an interview, there was hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and their ministers from CDU, SPD and the CSU have not at last voiced the "back to work".
It may have caused so many manual workers, doctors, Cassierians and other professional citizens in this country to question the right question, which is actually the difference between work and business, but it is not.
If the Federal Government is now so far, once again focusing on its mission - to the government - it should not be left out of the debate.
If the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and criticisms of the last few weeks, it will be possible to show it on Monday.
At evening, the tops of the government parties will be brought together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to invite these rounds on a regular basis to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the conflict.
First, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with diesel equipment and the law on the movement of experts.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let auto companies with exchange premiums glygly come from, and the manufacturers see SPD and CDU in the obligation to repair older Diesel technical equipment.
While the diesel crisis has been drawing closer over the past week, the Union and the SPD are still very closely involved in the planned technical migration legislation.
The SPD requires a living perspective for retired asylum seekers who work or make training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "spur change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be further conflict among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the Groko, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
The fight is good.
Without conflict, a society marked by such diverse but conflicting interests does not go forward.
In order to be constructive, however, the dispute must not be re-arranged for partial reasons on the question of being or not.
It's still about politics, not about the theater.
The Union and the SPD are going to fight - but the lives of people are always at stake.
What is makeable and useful to many?
With this question of guidance, both the diesel and the spray exchange question can be pragmatically clarified - and such confidence can be regained.
In particular, the People's Party must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visitor
Does the Minister of Labour judge against the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Actual day and night" had worked for their legislators in social security reform, a excessive social minister reported on the presentation of herself two weeks ago.
At the list-pilz-mandator Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she now brings the matter to Parliament by asking questions.
She says that "the minister only wanted to express his desire to express his desire to use her team and, in any case, would not want to report any violations of the right to service in front of the current camera".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be asked to be able to "free from any suspicion".
The police are looking for women's bodies on a street
Marxgrün - for a long time the police did not want to be out there.
Now there's confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the city street between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is still closed in the Marxgreen area until Monday.
It was said that the detector had used an archeology dog before.
The dog specially trained for the use of old human bones, together with its guide in multiple use, was able to limit the relevant position to a few metres.
In addition, along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bayerian Memory Protection Authority in the area of the affected road area, a bodenanomalia was discovered.
For more than a year, state law and criminal police have been processing the case.
Once again, a railway route was closed at Marxgrün and tested with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that this could have been damaged in the wake of the construction of the state street 30 years ago.
Colorful powders and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before the anniversary of Catalonia
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's already getting to cry before it's too late.
The separatists have not forgotten the use of police since autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, a meeting between the separatists and the police was held in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalonian security forces were attacked, inter alia, by independent advocates, with colourful powder to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.
About 3,000 officers of the police units Policía National and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who had been in use in the elections during the past year as an illegal referendum.
When trying to prevent citizens from voting, it was also violent at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the around 6,000 separatists had then tried to break the police tickets by violence, and the officers had to fire each other with paint bags and irons.
Six persons have been arrested, 24 others have been easily injured, and the authorities have been called upon to do so.
On Monday, the referendum on independence is the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to cancel the benefiting region of Spain, the central government in Madrid, Catalonia, in autumn 2017, was subject to forced administration.
The former regional president, Carles Puigdemont, flew into Exil to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in U-Haft.
In December the region of Neuwahlen was detained.
After the office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra is on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Overlagen Westfalls: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are stranded
Red-white sharks are still on the ground.
Even at the FC's loan, it was only a 0:0 difference.
The final light and the third hit them before 438 visitors to the Heidewald Stadium as a collection of randomity.
The first half was transparent from the maintenance factor.
Therefore, anyone who wanted a beer or a toast could do so without fear.
It was not the risk of losing a torchance because it was practically out of reach.
First Committee in half an hour
For the first (harmless) Torsshus of the entire party, Nick Flock was appointed in 28 minutes.
The best - and in principle only - could have been the chance of the athelers, when the Cihan Yilmaz FCG Tower of Frederic Westergerling was forced out of a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the Stramfam border.
Even worse were the guests.
Their most effective action was in an early exchange.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced by a condition of injury, for whom Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing long distances.
In the 48 minutes, Sebastian Mützel, 18 meters above the house, and after an hour, the good-byers were also the first time offensive in appearance.
After a ballering by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The newly proposed county of Sinan Aygün "krante" Nick Flock (62.) with a shot into the army of RWA-Towert Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed a football game by Wieckowicz (66.) after a football game by former athlete Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interimtrainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onukka for Martin Fohsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It didn't work.
More than optical superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the shareholders did not stand.
First in the 91st minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did he bring anything.
Angelo Dout last night tried to draw out the positive: "I like that we've played zero." But unfortunately, the zeros were also ahead.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holwickade and although our opponent had no desire to play here," observed RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensive "placed everything so little" against a team, "that just wanted to protect.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get an agent," he said.
However, as a observer, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a tower.
That was a good idea.
Recycling fields Erttendank market: There are enough creamers for happiness
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased to receive a copy of the billing table set for which they are intended.
The officials guarantee: "These funds also remain in Reckenfeld".
The sky appeared glowing blue, the place was still empty, but that should still change during the day.
Because, "This is so beautiful, so we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a good price Humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should be considered to be food, soon Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer will enter.
Verena (born by Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's already enough Kreimers.
And the "replace" was not allowed to keep the visitors more and more musically.
That became so good that after hours, some people were brought together.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vnemeyer was able to extend the opening term this time in his term plan.
He rejoices over the many assets with their positions, including excessive union.
"In fact, it should not be given as much as a table," he thanked himself for the action of the mangrove.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were at the stations in use and also the other festivals that took place in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden city has a beautiful ring - here's what's going on.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the maikranz from the fire and was taken to the winter quarter.
In many instances it was worked for the physical well-being.
From the south to the south, everything was to have.
Stefan Hameyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for the first time in a year, has been creative on his cover.
Furniture work, beer cover with rainforest motives and some more he had in his offer.
A specialty was built by three rain fields Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth Busschlütter.
Last names have another special feature.
Honigkuken in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Because the little Elsa had to get back together, the kitchen was so good.
The party is that the visitors then stayed long until evening hours, even without a dance program that is not available at the ceremony.
Smiley with local political message: No successful advertising for shooting facilities
In Lörech, unknowns have probably acquired very useful ways and methods for the construction of a disaster facility.
In several places there are corresponding complaints, Jürgen Kohne from the city administration says at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been punished for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lörech" are displayed on paintings, among others at the Gempt Hall and at the old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding letter was already discovered on 19 September following the election of the professional officer on the probésbeschilt at the entrance to Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding, they could have been removed without difficulty.
"Some days later, however, it stopped again, this time it woke up," said Rottmann.
It is clear that the corresponding trade mark must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case simply because several large companies from Länderch are also mentioned on the table.
If the disaster facility is built, it should also be made possible by sponsors.
In addition, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the city's professional field of school, sport and culture, without name.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the suspect table.
For years, local policies and administration have been dealing with the issue of disaster management.
After the old LWL clinic was built, after some time the search for an alternative site began.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the railway station.
This view has not been translated into - to many factors apparently speaking against a construction at this site.
At the end of June, he followed a rehearsal.
The members of the Main Committee and the Finance Committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne tells the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city square.
It comes from a decision this year so that it could be built with a positive vote in 2019.
Adapting to air traffic will make it even worse.
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic accident in the summer, the German fleets see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"In this year, we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the chief of the Air Safety Agency, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency in front of the air strike on October 5th in Hamburg.
An important reason for many delays and accidents is the well-known staff note in European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training of new fleets takes four to five years," said the trader.
In Europe, the market has been trained for finished-trained lotes.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticised that various air transport companies were not invited to the summit.
In Hanse City, representatives of the Federation, the countries, air navigation, airlines and airports come together on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work coverage and overtime, it won't go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German Federal Aviation.
Maas was again responsible for the EU Commission's tasks for the loten fishermen.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were too low.
The costs and staff savings resulting from this are now being fully incurred in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply in Brussels for regulations that "the air will not go further".
The EU's proposals would now be adopted by 2024 and further delays would be feared.
The EU would be constantly exposed to lobby printing from the airlines.
"Ryanair-Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now taken into account exactly what they have set themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delayed costs in the airlines would lead to a reflection.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Protection (DFS) offers a "voice training and future package", Maas said.
Up to now, the annual attendance of 120 lottery students over the next five years is just enough to compare the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is therefore not yet linked.
Thyssenkrup Overview Council agrees for Group numbering
The members of the Thyssenkrup Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the Group's plans to build.
According to the wishes of Thessenkrupp-Interirims chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed to the president at the Sunday meeting, the crisis groups should be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in the dining room and be noted at the pool.
An additional staff building should not be provided in addition to the already known cuts in the administration.
After two returns, the control gremium on the capital page is only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
However, the final decision is expected to take place in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrup Materials AG should include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the mergerd steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG is to be merged with supplies and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence against Demos by police and Catalan independence advocates.
In two contemporary demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been severe arrests with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independent protesters showed up.
The Catalan police have tried to keep both protests from one another.
According to the use force, however, independent advocates repeatedly tried to break the security ban.
They would have attacked the officers with color and dust shots.
Arrangements followed also between the participants of the various protests.
According to figures of rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told us that there were six arrests.
Improving colleagues' attitudes and appreciation
The police wanted to join the colleagues with their demonstration, who had spent almost a year against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish Central Government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better custody.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is wrong for Catalan and Basque police officers to earn more than they deserve.
The demonstrators accepted it as a provocation that the Spanish police were charged with demonstrators in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan Democrat Manuel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they have disturbed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old cop from the Balearics who wanted to name only Daniel showed the project back.
"Of course we want to support our cameras, who have only done their duty last year: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is to exercise our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more Echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not here to try," the police said.
Panne allowed access to personal data from the British Minister
A security accident at a phone app has resulted in the availability of personal data by ministers and members of the conservative British tour party on Saturday for everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the panic was announced one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach dances by top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star-Sturmer "has played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia", Juve-Coch Massimiliano Allegri praised after 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the recordmaster against the SSC Neapel.
For the trainer, the expensive Star was also bought without the man's own door in the important party against the persecutors.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even when we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and we grew up from the moment.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three trolls, Juve turned the game after the early retreat through the encounter of Tries Mertens (10. minutes) and joined the most noble follower first.
The former Bundesliga Prof. Mario Manzzukic, who provided a double package (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a ecke per headball, also took the lead in the encounter with the ex-husband Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had just had to break up before the tournament.
"There are many suggestions," the trainer praised.
But, of course, Allegri also wants to see towers from the attacker, who is both in the League champions and in the Portuguese national community of record protection.
"We have to get even better to serve him," asked the coach.
Best Juve protection is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to be even more impressive.
Seven Wins in seven games make the Makeleless Series in Series A. At 21 points, the master of the last seven years has already six figures of lead on Neapel.
The table width trained by the former Bayer-Coch Carlo Ancelotti was nevertheless not chanceless against the tour.
But at the latest after the departure of the already forgotten Mario Rui (58).
The Portuguese had to step too hard against Paulo Dybala with gelb root from the place.
"We have played well against a good neapel," commented the tournament coach.
Emre Can must have felt the same way about talking.
The German national player has spent himself at Juve.
The profile from the FC Liverpool was used in all seven league parties.
The middle-field editor also played against Valencia in the Championships League Party, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying at 2:0 a win of the tournament from the place and was blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changed his name
With a particularly shocking event, Rapper Kanye West has provided the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend for attention.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil pump provided him with a mineral water costume for stars and frescoes during his visits.
In addition, the 41-year-olds reported a change of name to publish his new albums.
Fortan can only be called "Yes" by the musician.
"The Wesen, formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in favor of the deceased singer Prince, as he quoted his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not new.
The tenth album has already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio player KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Yes" is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there it means "du", as the rapper says.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Pattern: Endlich!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a hero out of his imagination.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more griffer, we put him as well as never before."
Level two torcancers in 90 minutes so that only rare games can be designed positively.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is under SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first used Mike Krause from a tight angle to early driving (7.).
In the 43 minutes, Steffen would have been able to raise Uphus, but after great preparation of Krause, he explained freely.
The guests had only a double possibility as the first Moritz Höne to Torsteher Jos Schushmacher broke up and found his master in Jan Flower's nest in the Sendenhorster Kepper.
After the break, the guests became more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69).
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the Torline with his hand and saw for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use it for the guests (75.).
As soon as Niles Beredie saved the ball over the line, the party was chosen (81.).
"We had strongly criticized us before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Shipping Horst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, May, Kraus, Krause (77th anniversary), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th anniversary), Turl.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Monster: Spectacular Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is located in Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what I'm supposed to do," he said.
"We don't even have access to the arrivals." He must have meant flying with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but perhaps all the other green stars that pop up with a collective offensive range.
Nevertheless, he could say, "A bloody victory," he said, cheered up and went from there His players, however, was the relief that they had taken three points from the race.
Well-marked, after a couple of two men, one of whom plays for the mastership and the other, Albersloh to fight for the class.
With clearly mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we get back to 0:2, how we're against one of the top men of the League over the entire game, which was already really phenomenal."
So make it harder to get home with empty hands now.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the guests with his 12th season event (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this tower.
The 2:0 placed on the left side in a pattern for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew it, but such a player can't be completely excluded.
"This was already a dream that he has done," Lewandoski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without delay.
Shortly before the page change, his own Elf created the equation: McGills Freestoß from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Tohüter Hinkerohe in the long toreck (45).
After the change of page, it was again McGill, who made the comparison (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a childish, action-loaded game.
Nübel shot Albachten again (64.), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to recover the last Concordia transfer (80.).
We now have to adjust our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against Spartacus, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hööelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tower: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Spring (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nübel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Gelb-Rot: Atalan (74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fighting point against Primus
No winner has given it in the Landesliga Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The board leader was actually an angelist for three points, but the team of Trainer Oliver Pfaffe stood very well and the game ended at the end of 0:0.
Media: The entire Presidency of Dynamo Dresden
The entire presidency of the Dynamo Dresden football double-legist was subsequently returned to media reports.
Several media agree on a joint letter from the Sachsen Group on the evening.
At first, there was no confirmation of the Union.
The reason for the withdrawal is that internal forces should be at the top of the former Federal Lists.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pump
Good that he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departures in Germany provide as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days was the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne's guest, and many had meant that he should not even be invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Popular Guests and New Offers
The Gospel Academy Tutzing offers some 80 meetings up to the middle of the next year.
Because of this, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he wants to recover the price of tolerance in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wolff, the office was too short: he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy as president.
But before and after, Wolff was there for guests.
So he was called up by the academic director Udo Hahn when he said proudly: "All the federal presidents and the federal Chancellor were already with us." This was always prominent at the Academy in Tutzing Castle, but there was also a theme in the presentation of the annual programme.
At a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, at the end of October, Songmaker Konstantin Wecker participates in a meeting on September 29th, the writer Friedo Man is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Man.
In the meantime, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has also said: He wants to take the "tolerance price" paid by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also given in another category by television modernator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
There are about 80 meetings until mid-1919.
"The interest is not even safe!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risking and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting about Syria: "Barbaria without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war deserves every human idea."
From structural racism in society over the burdens between the poor and the rich to radical changes in the work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academie Director Hahn was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to seek solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting at 200.
The day of Karl Marx's birth was first expected by one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, others more than a trend "from left to right".
How does it look with neutrality?
"We are almost 100 percent of the daughter of the Evangelical Church," said scholar Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music carat: Sex Conception with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfalling News
"Regarded both for adults and for men" was the musical Cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday at the Hall of the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a Cabaretstin, Teubner pushed forward the sexual understanding, not only with humor and anger for the (sensitive) woman and (feeling) men and what else could be given, but also with music.
The mini-gitterre put her in and mastered her violin as well.
In the flight to Ben Süverkrüp.
It is for one of the male sparing partners who comes to the end of the sentence, for another a true pianist: so congenialally, with Süverkrup Teubner, some have wanted a solo.
This was also done with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, as it was suitable for the red Christmas of the evening.
There Teubner had brought into play a paradoxon: The satisfaction of a man, if he had a partner, did not open the door.
However, a closed door without a partner brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would come from the composite mozarts, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, supercrusted in improvisations, from Bachs "O main full of blood and veins" into the "play of death", and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphony in a played dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the hall.
Flowers moved Karlheinz Kleintje, director of the Union, the chancellor.
However, the President Heidemarie Markenbeck did not allow for additional thanks.
She had the idea of sending the duo next to events in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's Landslag: Ahlender SG holds against TV Watershed almost the white West
Problems were mainly with third-party player Carolin Stallmann, who had only 10 hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the reverse, only one player has made too many towers.
We haven't got them in the grip," says ASG-Coch Dog Adogdu.
But he was more proud of the many opportunities he had left.
The concentration at the end left his men missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG loved almost to the end of a retreat, left the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45).
Only against the end did the wider bank of the guests make a decisive note.
In addition, Aydogdu Backroom Merle Klement placed on the left-hand side, which then made "extreme clever the decisive towers" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buskötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Women's League: Supervision of the BSV East Cover in the top game at VC Allbau Diet
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV Eastern defenses have re-established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At two-legged VC Allbau Eater, the blue stars won with 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the League.
We've developed this now," Trainer Dominik Münch rejoiced for the almost endless performance of his men at the winning table.
The first pass dominated the guests almost after love.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the Vizimester of the preceding year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the second row, but it has not come into play.
We've worked them well.
Our opponent has been at high risk, but has also produced several driving cards.
In the second sentence, the BSV has already led with 12:8. "The food has changed the acceptance on three lines.
We couldn't keep the pressure down.
Food's been on the run, and we've had a bit of crying," says Munich.
At 18:17, for the first time, the volleyballers from the Ruhr area had their noses.
On the other hand, at 19:24, four additional seats were left, but the fifth attempt had its goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the exercise guide to the growing level.
Mike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebeke Silge are significantly contributing to the fact that the BSV used the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "That's what we did and played quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-whites went through four with 25:22 on their side.

International: Turkish communities: Moscow opening as a past chance
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way and way in which the great Dibib-Moschee in Cologne was brought into existence by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a desk in the German-Turkey relationship, which can only be brought together," said TGD president Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German pages would have missed the chance of a common, seductive appearance.
"Statt, on the other hand with German top politicians to undermine the presence of Muslims in Germany, Erdogan used the term for his purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The increasing exclusion of the German public has "increased many reservations".
Home Nottuln: The offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally time for the people to meet again.
On 18 October (donnerday) at 19.30 p.m., the home of Nottuln is already holding its fifth Nottulner meeting in the old office room.
Almost on the day it is a year ago that we have been conducting a national meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a solid part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," Hans Moormann, president of Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our people's meeting was going so fast in nottuln.
Whether Stormtif Friederike in January or Hetzewelle in July, the office room was always fully occupied.
"The program is always a solid mix of German folk, wanderers and seamen's leaders, folkongs, Evergreens and old shooters," says Karl Heinz Stevermüer, who invites the ever-increased music player to Nottuln.
To the first folk date "Birth day" Klaus Gamellmeyer said with his accordion.
He was a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from the vicinity of Steinfurt, who played music with plain German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
Well, the artist of the people's event at the last event in summer, as Christoph Schulz from the People's Day event, with his international thought of the song "Fresh in the night" encouraged the audience and sent the audience to the house with a shout.
"We are counting on many happy guests to spend once again a simple and humorous evening," says the invitation of the host.

China approves planned merger by Linde and Praxair

FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are making further progress on the way to the world's largest industrial companies.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the planned merger, shared Linde on Sunday.

From pure fruit plant to ecological
With a gala in the Dr. Stumberger Hall, the 125-year-old creature of the circle bond for garden construction and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a crop look at the Kultmbach United House, the last ground pump was set for the circle link for garden construction and land care Kulmbach, and 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kultmbach City Hall on Saturday afternoon.
He was free to take another step: he was taken from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 as a "Bezirkskostbauverein Kulmbach City and Land".
Even the purpose of the fruit plant was different from today's work - it was actually clean about the plant, and no one thought of flowering and gardening at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the declaration, the fruit tree was a favorite daughter of the elites," Kreishiimatpfleger Günter Dipold said in his festival contract.
Fruit trees should be planted by remote roads, so-called industrial measures were set up at schools.
The construction is still the task of 55 garden construction companies in the Kulmbach district, which includes nearly 7,000 members.
However, this does not create the spectrum at all.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village recreation and food play a similar large role as the media of knowledge, healthy food and youth work.
As diverse as the task areas of a garden construction company, the members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwurfe" showed themselves at the stage.
"Young people's work is particularly urgent in the digital age," said the vice president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The Castian collection was a huge story for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with smartphones & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees along with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where to stand, the circle bond decides," Landrat Söllner added, adding the special importance of garden construction companies for the villages.
The circle bond is for the ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real case of many garden construction companies in the countryside also made no doubt about it by circular business leader and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led many visitors with an image project through the long history of the circle bond and reported, inter alia, the need for self-sustainment after the war.
Before, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was introduced.
At the end of the 50s, however, the useful gardens have turned into a Zeir and residential garden.
"The nature has a stock, it was already before us and we have to focus on it," the expert for fruit and nut trees complained.
That is why it gives the garden builders the opportunity not to follow the lead, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the exciting return to insects, which we owe our children and individuals," Günter Reif concluded the victory festival, which was celebrated by the drummers of Thurna's music.

Priority on Nafta Talks: Canada Foreign Minister leaves UN-Speak
Mexico Government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: they make both trading partners an ultimate agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now accords the trade agreement with absolute priority - and transmits its speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time on the ring of a new flag of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Christia Freeland has moved their speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the Minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations plenary meeting, her speaker Adam Austen shared it with him.
In the meantime, they focus on the re-treatment of naphtha.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, had said on Friday that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the USA would have had 48 hours of time to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico had agreed to a revision of the Nafta regional Free Trade Agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from naphtha in the future.
The discussions on a new stage have been held for over a year.
Until Sunday (the second time) they are to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's Government wants to present the agreement before 1 October before the US Senate.
For the case of a scandal in the negotiations, President Andres Manuel López Obrador of Mexico announced on Friday that he would try to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in an attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report of the newspaper "O Globo" where he lived.
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63 years will take place in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil on open roads.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went on the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "El nou" (German: "No"), women had been called against the ex-Military in particular.
In the social networks, the alliances against Bolsonaros also made racist and feminine statements mobile.
In the São Paulo Metropolis, thousands of demonstrators were expected.
In the capital city of Brazil, protests were filed with a customer of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
It concerns the position of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who has been sentenced to 12 years of corruption and therefore cannot apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is October 7th.
As former mayor of the Millionenstadt São Paulo, Haddad lived in interrogations far beyond the right-hand candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trup Brazils" has been mixed with politics for a long time, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
None of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a vote on October 28.
Observers point out that Bolsonaro will not be successfully removed from this - no, it does not.
Bolsonaro is known for his violence against homosexuals and blacks and the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with false solutions.
On another occasion, he said that the supporters of Lulas' left party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish Rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared with Larsen's website.
On the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been treated since the beginning of the year because of prostatic cancer.
Larsen became known as the band Gasolin, which was very successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimmy Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the end of the 1978 band, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold in Denmark around three million plates.
His album "Midt per night" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday as a "strengthening", which "was against everything but in all hearts".
The Head of Government recalled that the monarchy-Generator Larsen was present on the 70th day of the birth of the Danish King Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Sound strength at the pressure level
"Here we stand, take the bones and kiss a concert table with the strength of a tiger." Only the names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday at the Hall of the City Centre Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure by three other friends band.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert, the musician even takes time for a group photo.
There's no trace from the lamp.
Then, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the environment - all in connection with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their gangs loud enough to see about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows about the recording of the concert week also with the latest, unknown pieces from his own feds and the first CD to appear.
In front of the stage, the band's vocal and printed composition is played.
Although "Zugab" calls are not to be stopped, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Lord We Stand".
The Hardrock is not the same as the Hardrock, showing guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierenrich at the base and Kai Hölscher with their alternative, suitable for classical rock, which reminds us of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" comes at "Her We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only is the visible, just ballady "Take Me Home" consists of the exchange of melodic passages to the guitar-laden rockifs of the many songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuchen has since its establishment in 2005.
The band presents its hardware on Saturday.
The "The Ignition" documented in a video by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - has a special stage experience, is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets in conjunction with the band at the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, all its own accents.
To feel even higher controlled sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a surrounding solo, where he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is re-enacted at such a hardrock concert, of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the sound of the mixpult team's experience is at the three concert of "Her We Stand", "Tiger Bonesow" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is about the level of press air thermomer, but it is still important to show the "Wakeen-Festival" on the "The Ignition" website.
The average audience of 120 decibels in dücentrie-bleust strengths such as the annual metal starlight in the north of the Republic does not need to do so during this rock night.
After about four hours, the three bands of the tougher rock gang have long convinced their sovereign, virtual game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone fragments and crushed a concert table with the strength of a tiger," all three groups can say, freely in the transfered sense, at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A fatal accident at the airport of Essen/Mülheim
At Mülheim/Essen Airport it has become a fatal accident.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane is stopped on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
In the vicinity of Mülheim/Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the "West German General newspaper", a sailplane was wrecked at the airport's exhibition park.
The pilot would have come to life.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, if the pilot was on board alone, it would be a substitute for the pilot.
The aircraft has already been on the landing at the time of the accident.
The airport is only located near a stop on the airport.
However, this week, there has been an October festival.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two resorts and directly on the road to the highway 52.
From the parking lot, there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
"And then we fell in love with each other."
The fact that the US President of North Korea Machthhaber Kim has been greatly favored despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now, Trup has made his colleague a regular statement of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the age of 72, the newly married US President has become known as a new flame.
Tragic: It's a remote connection.
In all the audience, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean Governor Kim Jong Un.
Before accession to the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for half the old Spross of the Herrscherdynasty from Pjungjang, although he is showing himself in the ring around North Korea as a true pair of bridges.
"I was quick, he too, and between us it went in and here," said Trup.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not just the conversations with Kim had brought his heart into trouble.
He wrote me beautiful letters, it was great letters.
Your personal connection has also brought political results: Trump refers to the stop of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics continue to see little more than lip recognition.
That it should not be any memory of "Rocket Man" - so Trumps Spitzname for Kim - should be known to the U.S. President.
In any event, he took the expected criticism of him at his event in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How awful, how awful is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he took care of it very little, explained Trump and directed his finger to the crowd: "I have always told you it's so simple to be a presidial."
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there in this valley filled with Arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
October party attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's best visit, voteful and undisputed by Sun set: Very varied and with a good shot of Octoberfestflair, Baesweiler's inner town came out on Sunday.
For the first time, the October festival took place not only in the railway station but also in the city on Sunday.
Refugees Thanks to video released from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have shown their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya through a phone video and thus have made their survival possible.
The group had driven the entry into its cell in the coastal city of Savija in July under a life-threatening threat and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally evacuated to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we would probably not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach the Mediterranean through Europe.
With the video, he made his own statement in danger of life.
One of his rivals was murdered by the guards almost to death, Onyeka said.
In general, the bad conditions have been disastrous: "They're killing us all with raisins and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees who are displaced in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year using the program, said IOM speakers in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now saved was not unusual in view of the bad conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a help from a phone video before.
International organizations have been critical of the situation in the Libyan refugee camps for a long time as human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare for her school for Monday, she was surprised.
By 16:50, the teacher operates the building over the main entrance.
At the front door of the 1st floor, she saw a man running right away.
First through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a ladder into the ground or the front floor.
The teacher understood the police involved in the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen can't be said yet.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, something darker appearance, dark hair, dark T-shirt.
Please refer to the Obernberg police inspection at Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was arrested in his own car long ago.
A 75-year-old in a forest area in central France had to hide several days and nights in his car after he had stopped the car from all over the woods and blocked a tree from the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the Pkw on Saturday afternoon at random near a distance and released those who had been serving the missing persons, sharing with the police on Sunday.
The 75-year-olds from Pleinfeld were given the following information despite the cold night and the long time without providing health care.
He started to enjoy his home now.
The renter was reported to be missing from his family, after he had not returned on a day of work by a car with his car over the local roads and fields.
Despite intensive research, the man’s stay has remained unclear for a long time.
Laschet has legal status in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) recommended the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his own statement of legality in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "exceeded", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Kolner Airport.
This is particularly true in matters of detention, press and freedom of religion.
He therefore said to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalised in the future, economic relations should be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important condition.
Laschet also spoke in his own words about the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Erdogan again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The talk of Laschet and Erdogan was recently delivered in a facility of the Federal Defence Ministry at Kolner Airport.
It was originally intended to take place in the castle - but the owners had refused political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued after the conversation to open the dibib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had said a joint performance in the construction work.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea makes a request for disarmament
While US President Trump will not be able to stress the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the ostasiatic regime is closer.
Foreign Minister Ri demands an agreement with Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has called on the US government to block negotiations for an atomic-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The most recent stand is that the United States is building on enforcement measures that are harmful to confidence training," said Ri in New York.
A relief will be unforgettable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will attack ourselves as the first ones," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
Nordkora's criminal action on the "knee" could be "a desire of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and rocket test and destroyed an atomic test system, Hob Ri above.
However, on the US side, it did not provide "recorded reactions", criticised by the minister.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times a year alone on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been engaged in strict compliance with criminal measures in the past days with the United Nations.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trup first hit North Korea Mahthaber Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is planning a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again talk about the completion of the North Korean nuclear weapon programme to Pjungjang.
Hot served: New kitchen with supplies from the community
Because they were actually in a youth meeting, many visitors from the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: white blankets and flowers on the table and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the Ernteck Good Service.
The young people of the Hot had the buffet with costumes from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank for the food.
The start with the new facility was not just as Henryte Westbuer, the leader of the Hot, remembered.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared on the big day.
The first day after the summer break, however, the bad surprise came: A storm had set the heavy, double refrigerator outside of operation, the food was ruined and had to be taken care of.
"Now we had to start again: although we received very much support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone," said Westbury.
And so they all packed up.
The result could be seen as the guests were excited.
"It’s better not to cook too," a visitor exclaimed, while Hokkaido-Curbiz soups were served or guests had to be served at a kitchen, dining room or kitchen.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," emphasised Father Frank Beckmann, while Zauberer Stephan Lammen with carded tricks and other works of art for refurbishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the country president NRW of the table
From fresco on criticism of the series itself, the Chief of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his posts in the country's association.
Sartor was widely known because the Essener table had introduced a registration stop for foreigners.
He was already back as vice president of the NRW tables in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I like too many back there.
The Head of the Tablen-Landsband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed concern at the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-term representative.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can follow his steps - there have been people who didn't even know exactly why the Essen's table does it."
But Sartor was still active for the Essener table - "six days a week because nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
Sartor criticized colleagues of other tables in the "World on Sunday" again.
You can't follow the approach without the people in the city.
It would be the task of the State to ensure that people do not become pregnant.
At a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin, Essener did not participate.
"I'll be told too much sweet taste," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have criticized me this time too.
SF Lorch play 2:0 driving - Gmünder Daily Post
Fößball, District Lorch lost against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen sees in Kirchheim after departure - Bettrigen hits Luuchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch in the home game against the TV Newer already in charge - at the end of stood 2:3 and the frustration with the sports friends was great.
Everything else about TV Heuchlingen: In Churchheim the TV is fast with 0:1 in the back, but after 90 minutes, the SGB was able to reach the table with a 3:0.
Gladbach played double lead - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borusia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an exit in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the arrows play twice a lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season (1:0).
(sda) Four times, Schalke managed in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again put their strengths on the day that it had placed the first place behind the Bayerns in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the homeiquipe in the 11th minute after the strong work of Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, thus preserving the minipolster with a compact defence performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borusia Dortmund grew again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had engaged himself against Bayer Liverkusen until the break, however, in the second half it was still 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) look like a double, four-minute break, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in 63. Minutes, provided another double in the final phase (86/94).
For the first time, the VfB Stuttgart also came.
Against this, because of a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic, werder Bremen had already been dezimerized before the break, the Stuttgarter had to join in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the remarkable Goalie Ron-Robert destinationrs manufactured a curiosian single-project owner, who slowed the guests in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience complete success, but neither did he have a misbehavior for Borusia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quarter Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria, and Lang, the gladbachers, who were represented by the Swiss quarter, gave a lead from the hand, played at 2:2 and were still waiting as before 2003 for a show in the VW city.
For Wolfsburg's comparison to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal leader.
In the 20-metre-long airship, Yann Summer was free of charge as well as in the second attack after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are quite surprising.
Alasane Plea is seen in the stream of the foals as a gold miner.
The French record purchase by the OGC Nice against Wolfsburg was the third time in follow-up and the seventh time in the seventh game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach sits on the 4th floor.
Within 40 minutes, the unscathed words of Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart were in an unfavourable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart county that the ex-Luganese Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season event, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serb succeeded in a tricot attack against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Although Stuttgarts defended Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Targeter brought the brakes back to the game by means of a kuruss-injector (68.), a quarter-hour before closing, Gonzalo Castro threw them back to the winning streets.
Nürnberg decided to conquer the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 for itself.
After a half hour, Hanno Behrens brought the team home by footenalty to course.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether the name of their country should be changed in northern Macedonia.
In one case, the nearly three-year-old skirmish conflict with the neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had been founded on a change of name because of its same-named northern province, and every approach to Macedonia was blocked to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become a member of NATO at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Sir in U-Haft.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian wounded three pensioners brutally and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old Asylywerber had run off at 22 hours on Friday in the air gas in Alsergen.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who had been throwing stones at passengers and tried to arrest them, to his conduct.
On the contrary, the Syrian tried to strike and attack the officials.
Shortly thereafter it became apparent that the suspect had hit three older women on the road in front of the Mänginger street (65, 67, 75) with his feet on the ground.
He also had the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were severely injured.
They experience haematoma, seizures and brain damage.
The asylwerber was "from an unknown reason", as it had been since the police, and was severely injured.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored regularly during treatment.
SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two went to the Javort.
If a registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had said before the "image" set.
"If we're married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a political speaker of the SPD-Bundedags group and one of the speakers of the Seahead Circle, the conservative SPD-Flight.
In the federal debate on the opening of the wedding for homosexuals, Kahrs had adopted an opinion on 30 June 2017.
So he had suggested that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) have "extremely" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in a play on the visible announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal couples can marry exactly as heterosexual.
They had been able to apply for their partnership of life since 2001, but there was no comparison with the marriage, i.e. with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters cut heck
There was a lot of work for the members of the Civil Society Children's House and the Lepracund society.
Because about 400 meters of hecke around the gardens of the inhabitants of the springhouse should be cut off.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the president of the Civil Society Walter Schröer.
And that's how it got together.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but luck is now just a fraction.
Because in the spring, you've already shot the heck once.
The next morning at work is also a long tradition.
"It's supposed to stay with all the forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Heritage in Rio: Hannes Aigner holds gold at the Canuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect course on the Olympics on Sunday.
Two years ago, he spent another three hundred seconds on Olympic Bronze.
I was well prepared, had already had enough driving on the plant and it's all right today," said the Olympics of London 2012.
In the goal he took his path before joy and went to both arms safely to the height - of course it would be at least for a medal.
Anyway, there's a start number four.
However, the six remaining beginners were unable to raise his fever time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russians, Pavel Egel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first intrusion test of this brain in a single family home.
Fortunately, the killers broke up.
The days will be shorter - that is what criminals want to use again.
The police inspection Gautting reported the first outbreak of this brain yesterday.
That it has remained on the royal road while trying to stay at the home of the family is to be appreciated.
That was when the teasing took place just 20 hours ago on Friday.
The offenders claimed that the inhabitants were not at home.
However, the alarm system surprised them apparently in such a way that they could catch the flight without delay.

Pleite at Hertha: from reality: Bayern against Ajax
The lecture is inconceivable: The Netherlands in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "not fall away".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interfacing phase for the official time of Niko Kovac.
The first small parts of the new coach Niko Kovac should not, however, increase the depth of the miner.
"A week ago you had the impression that we were invisible.
Now we have a little bit of the reality," Thomas Müller noted after the worthy 0:2 replication at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the champions-League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that we're doing the right thing and that's why we're giving gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no own tower has been shot, as at the same time of the pre-season two games in series without winning, the lead of the football club first lost to Borusia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as for the end phase of the broken Carlo Ancelotti end of September 2017, the recordmaster must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running anti-man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful naddles on the outside, have delivered in three days the same two blue-eyes as the last superseding Bayerns have yet to knock.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't let this happen and we will do everything we can to make it work again," Kovac stressed.
On the contrary, with his losses in his birth city, however, he was pleasantly calm and created his first landing as Munich Coach only on the re-enactment with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Bourusia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the country's first interfacing phase of its official era more positive - otherwise the tone would probably have to grow.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfia Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation begins on the second round against Ajax, which also forced AEK Athens to conquer with 3:0.
"Now we've been raised in two games, but we're also going to make our doors again," declared Nationalmannschafts Captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost pocal final against the entry of Frankfurt in the same position, Joshua Kimmich Chacht spoke in particular.
The lawyer acts in the role of the lawyer.
"I don't think that's all pech, we have to work it back again because we don't make the number of chances and make the mistake," stressed the 23-year-olds shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game, the Bayerns even placed five figures behind Dortmund, who now took over the peak with a point of priority.
And this is how Kimmych, with an eyebrowing at least positive, has now found the public debate about the potentially infamous Bayerns.
"Yes, that's good enough," said the national player.
It's a good time for the League.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Cusa: Scharfe Attack by Erdogan and Grindel
The Turkish President of State Erdogan, with serious prejudices, calls on Mesut Özil and Ilkaya Gündogan to be restricted in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees a mistake, but defends the connection line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - At various stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought about the strength of tenacity in the long-term battle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President of State in opening the Great Dibib Moscow in Cologne strongly criticised the deal with the former world master in Germany, the DFB chief defended the connection line.
Early Sunday morning, Özil personally witnessed the consequences of the incident in Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio" from the cause.
"We must in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-humans - very accurate conclusions that something is not going on," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration team.
At the same time, it was explained once again that Erdogan is not for the values of the football and the DFB.
With sharp words, this had provoked racism against Özil and Ilkaya Gündogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkaya.
They have been excluded from this society because they took pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the city of Domstadt.
I honestly said that as your President, I could not bear to say that our two young men, who have been admitted to the German National Union, were excluded.
Grindel refers to Gündogan's statement that he, in contrast to Özil after the WM campaign that took place in photos of the two with Erdogan, felt "soundly treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would want to appear before players in the future.
That's what someone says: If I win, I am German if I lose, I am a migrant - that's not going.
"Because he has such an impression, I'm very sorry," said Grindel.
We had to protect Mesut more than I've ever said.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özils to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer should be appointed in addition to the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a non-Migrating background has a significant impact on society and football and says, "The topic is important, because we need to take care of it," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our unity in a place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil affair, he wants to re-elect the office as DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my work and I try to do it as well as it goes," Grindel said.
Last year, three accidents occurred within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 hours.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red bell in the audience's height.
This one told the renter that he was threatening her car.
But it did not happen to a personal exchange because the 75-year-old lady could no longer find the lady on the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a phone message about a car driver who would come out of the street and run against a driver.
In response, the man did not want any police in front of him, and then he was threatened.
Then the red man went home.
However, the renter has been in his place of residence, where he has been living, processing and hiding a construction vehicle on the road for decades.
Finally, the police could find him and arrest him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a bad impression and couldn't think much more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorburn in meppen: Still nearly 1000 user forces in use.
About four weeks after the explosion of the Moorbrand in a federal territory in Emsland, 980 forces are still employed with the waste operations.
That was shared by the Federal War on Sunday.
As the position of a speaker continued to be stable, 70 honourable assistants were removed.
A further reduction of the number of use forces has been planned, that is.
On the night of the sun, a fire from above was discovered and deleted.
Last week the disaster was lifted, which was declared a good week before September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements by wind and funnel flight.
On Thursday, then, there was no more need for an overrun of the fire to the surrounding communities.
At the same time, more than 1500 users tried to gain access to the Great Fire under control.
The aircraft supports the work on the federal road test site in Meppen with a transport driver.
In addition, there are clear flights with Drownen of the Bundeswehr.
For October 2 and 5, Germany also re-planning flights with "Tornados" were planned.
The fire was dissolved by tests, which airbus technicians had fired.
The smoke from the Moorbrandd was then driven up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a meeting to address the damages.
First claims for damage have already been announced by hotel owners and holiday owners.
SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left the main church in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage, the politician has married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two went to the Javort.
If a registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had said before the "image" set.
If we're married, then we're right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a political speaker of the SPD-Bundedags group and one of the speakers of the Seahead Circle, the conservative SPD-Flight.
In the federal debate on the opening of the wedding for homosexuals, Kahrs had adopted an opinion on 30 June 2017.
So he had suggested that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) have "extremely" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in a play on the visible announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal couples can marry exactly as heterosexual.
They had been able to apply for their partnership of life since 2001, but there was no comparison with the marriage, i.e. with the right of adoption.
The referendum in Macedonia started on new state names
In Macedonia, the proposed referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ contributions and release those involved in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change anything in order to continue to be adopted only with express consent, stressing Swiss transplantation.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ contributions and relieve those involved in stress situations.
People who want to make their bodies available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs can continue - as in Germany - only with express consent, stressing Swiss transplantation.
It is clear that 15 percent of Switzerland has a way of spending, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss-based Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will find a card at the decisive moment in potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the members do not know the will of the deceased.
"Then they have to decide deliberately in the sense of the dead, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organs on the health card, as the Federal Health Center speaker Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register, in which people can apply their wishes - pro or against organs - is not available," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has spoken for a renewal of the organs.
According to his proposal, everyone would first apply as an organ donor, whether he or his colleagues object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church condemns this.
14-year-old students are world teacher in the mainstream
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world teacher in the mainstream.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 rivals.
Martina Flemme-Jasper shared with her on Sunday with the Phaeno Science Museum, the place for the opening of the battle.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany made the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student who was the oldest 74-year-old pensioner in France, as chief judge Ralf Laue said.
The information professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since visitors were not allowed, on Saturday afternoon there was a show, when the participants spoke against guests from the public with cash computers.
Wenzel grey from lasturp demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries sought to qualify for competition.
Greß was already two years old as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With concepts such as superhero, genius or wonder child, organizer noise can begin a little.
"Heattimes can be trained," he said.
Many participants spent several hours each day.
In India or Singapore, even in stadiums, there are fair competitions.
For example, the square root line of six numbers is the discipline.
When counting for diversity, the candidates receive surprise tasks that they must quickly find a solution.
Here, too, the Germans had good opportunities, said the chief judge.
On the other hand, Asians often benefit because they are already learning more intensive and other effective methods in early childhood.

Polare Kalt air brings Neuschnee to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle throws out her bed for the first time in the West: Polare Kalt air arrives on Mount Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Center for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week is 1,500 to 1,200 meters - it could be narrowed to about 1,000 meters below.
From Bregenzerwald to the high towers it was over 2,000 meters above 20 to 40 cm in diameter.
On higher passenger routes (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieller Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions will therefore be winter.
Farmers may start on Monday with the annual snack provision
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers can start on Monday with the annual knife supply.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have been the landscape of the mighty Federal Republic of Germany for some 200 years.
The up to five meters wide range of trees and shrubs are "earth-set" and for many animals and plants the last back spaces.
Knicks connects existing living rooms as corridors, which can still work on the exchange of organs, as the businessman of the Nature Protection Unit Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living cells
The Knicks were established on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christ VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living zones" were not only field limitations and viehzaun, they also supplied the farmers with fuel and bars for their professional homes.
Since then, his name "knick" has also come from: Through "cooking" of the osteoporosis, the thick, ruptured limits have been developed.
Today, between the north and the east, about 45,000 kilometres of the hills extend and lay the picture of a cold, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are currently used as a substitute space for about 7,000 animals.
In a kilometer, you can live up to 1800 different species and live up to 30 birds.
However, its ecologically important function can be performed only if it is performed properly in winter.
Otherly, he is comfortable with a light range of trees, which also includes wind protection in addition to the variety of species, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the knife can only be operated from October to March in the spring.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talks about location
The native Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on the Tsunamis yourself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on Java Island.
When the earth was full, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then, when I learned from Tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can be imposed.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally established something where we have committed other people.
Where are the people who live on Sulawesi now?
Many are trapped in surrounding caves, where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their homes, there are still babies.
Because many food business and also the tanks are completely closed, people partly close food and gasoline.
The public service is completely detached and the national government is helping.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partially free and the search for them was difficult.
There are still many bodies here, many people have not been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply run on the island?
At the moment, we have received handshake, however, it has not worked, and we have only access to information on radio.
Many people still look for their children, neighbors and other people who do not know whether they are alive and where they are staying because people were not at home during the earth’s journeys, for example, on the job.
The Tsunami alarm system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for it, but when the quake came, many thought "okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not affected by Tsunami, there was a lack of information that a Tsunami hit the region and they are stranded on the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi that lies on the Pacific Firering prepared on Earth?
But every day there are earthquakes, but this here was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has been broken down, and the earth has hit many people.

Julian Eberhard beat the WM-Median
Four places at Olympia were long in the stomach of Biathlet Julian Eberhard.
In the coming winter, the Saalfelder wants to retain the lost precious metal at the WM in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic Sprint of Pyeongchang to catch the medal.
Seven ten seconds were missing at the end of the bridge.
"I've been aware of the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of MyGym Fitness Studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
So the Pinzgauer is more motivated to follow the ordered precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back with the constitution to a great event to win something.
Sometimes you have to add.
The WM-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) lies Eberhard: "I've already closed the line into my heart", he remembers with joy his fourth world Cup in the single race last year.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI research in turbotime
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is severely limited.
With a FBI survey at the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to ensure the high-level majority of judges candidates who are challenged by demand.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday to clarify the potential events for more than 30 years.
The most recent developments in the drama about the Kavanaughs profession, accompanied by a cultural struggle, were solved on Friday.
Following an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose case the law-enforced tyrants against the opposition democracies, the Senate Justice Committee should make the way open for the final confirmation of the conservative director at the Supreme U.S. Court.
Most Republicans appeared to be assured that, as Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement, he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After multarian scenes, his party friends wanted to join him.
President Trump, who had called the harsh conditions on Thursday as "begs", initially called himself an attack on women and spoke against "lucky in the accident".
In this way the last doubts could be raised, he said.
The Democrats later attacked Trup at a election ceremony because they refused: "They tried to block and destroy them."
Trup ordered FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also very limited the powers of the detector.
It is intended to investigate the alleged charges of two women, no more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They're not going on an asylum trip".
According to the New York Times, there are only four witnesses.
The mobile, installed in a "civil vehicle" radar device of the city municipality Ried for the monitoring of the Tempolimite is located on the street of the city on Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The city community also has several fixed Radarboxes installed.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Man has overcome the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Middleway is widely known that Christian Heidel is a giant pessimist in football games.
That wasn't different in the game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many echoes and many dances in our gym," said Schalke's sports board 04 - and agreed.
Finally, it was still possible to bring the king's blues to 1:0 against the rheins over time and thus to bring the first season's vision under roof and fashion.
This could have really been different.
After taking the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11, the commander's team Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In summe the first half time was good, both playful and the pressing here.", apparently more and more the head played with increasing play duration.
Don't create memory for headball
"The last ten minutes have been touching me like two hours," he said, "if the man was just half as nervous as I am on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept coming back.
And with man and mouse he defends himself against Mainz.
To save the first three figures of the season.
"We all have fallen a lot of stone from the heart," said the Creator, who had nothing to do with his headball experience: "I'm actually the worst football player in the human race."
But it's only the victory at the end.
The relief was impressive throughout Arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the beginning phase and make a firework," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the men and the fans.
We've played smart, quiet and bravely, so we have to go to parties over 90 minutes.
Perhaps the biggest lack of the afternoon: king blue missed it, rather for clearer relations of concern.
The possibilities for this were concluded by the strong Yevhen Compplyannaka, who twice met the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then there wouldn't have been any tears," said Tedesco, "the fear has already been a bit frightened."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only switch.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye height
The author is Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Housechild for the second time.
"I've been doing this for many years, taking interested people to Greven," explained the founder and president of the "Cultural Policy" - the association that co-operated with the "Culture Policy" campaign on the evening.
El-Mafaalani goes on to read, describes the writing process of the book, tells of how difficult it was to explain the subject in understanding.
With a lot of gestics, handshake numbers and one or the other, he brings the audience closer to one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why is there a growing conflict in spite of successful integration?
The Syrian author is responsible for the question of a metaphor.
At one table, the German society is the first generation's migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they are already on the big table and want to be with them now.
This leads to conflicts.
That is why, not whether you are politically right or left, but, "Am I for or against an open society?" he stressed.
At first, they behave better, and then the debate is always under way.
And there's a network need.
A Afghan refugee tells from his perspective two teachers how they see successful or unencumbered integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not at the stage, a meaningful image for the discussion: it is at the height of the eye.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks from the average, not from individual means.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the next Signer hour, he has also been given an open ear to the questions of the guests, as well as in the Foyer, in the preparation of Kurdish specialities, intensively further discussion.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 pieces
The need is obvious: over 100 interested parties have purchased one of the basics in Landsham-South.
The municipality has sold the first pieces of landham-South in the free market.
This is part of the mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for these 20 pieces, which offer the community more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former domestic model.
Good 100 applications have been made, so frick.
"At that time the documents will be examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Pilinger Mayor, it was the aim of setting up the applicant list for the 20 pieces by the end of the year and presenting them to the Council.
Then the surrender may take place.
In total, 50 basic units for single and double houses were created in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated 8 units of residence.
The creation is as good as done, the streets and roads should be cut off first.
A single piece, as well as two of the multiple families, is a private person, the rest of the community's pension.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 basic parts in the social-contractual model.
The two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built according to Frick as a affordable living room.
With a total of 16 apartments promoted by the Freestaat.
Place for 200 people
Grob is estimated to be created on the ground floor of the landscape of Landsham-South living room for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, early in October, according to Frick, there is the start for the renewal of a child's day job.
Three children's gardens and three groups of cranes, as well as a multi-purpose area, should be provided.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the beginning of the next childhood year.
So far, Schalkes Naldo's "great sport" is also on the bank
For the third time, it is not in the starter: However, Naldo is grateful to Schalke trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two-foot Brazilians had ever told the fruit of the soul so correctly.
But when the players gathered after the 1:0th victory over the FSV Mainz 05, as usual in the middle circle, and thanks to the chief coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professions, the 36-year-old, who called all the simple Naldo players, became one and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-capitals, who did not raise any groll in spite of his renewed reserveist design.
It seems likely that Naldo, who was celebrated as the best speaker in the past season, knows that he did not actually speak to his trainer at all – but for good reasons.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy for him to tell you what I'm telling you honestly," said Tedescu from the moment he had told Naldo that he wasn't in the start.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the union," Germano reasoned the step.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that you can get through all the time.
And that we're all in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also been discovered by Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: he also showed himself to the bank as an exemplary model.
The vote in Austria's industry in August has accelerated its tariff rate compared to the eurozone.
The sales manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month basis.
In Europe the third largest poll in Ireland and the Netherlands has, however, been shared by the Market Institute on Monday with some 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro area increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still in line with the mark of 50 figures, which represents growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke down with 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42,1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, however, the voting margin was lower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest point with 44.0 points since March.
"The mildly weakened talf heart could mean that the worst survives," said Markit-Ekonom Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains - in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export contracts in the euro area fall as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore set off the seventh month following.
In China, industry production was even more widely accepted in August than at first.
The vote barometer is falling from 49.3 points per month at 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The sales manager index supports its figures on representative questionnaires of 3,000 European industrial companies.
In particular, developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices will be taken.
