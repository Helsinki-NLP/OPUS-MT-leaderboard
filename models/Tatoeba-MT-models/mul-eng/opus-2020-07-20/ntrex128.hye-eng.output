The members of the Welsh Asambulle were concerned about being considered to be “fashioned. ”
Some members of Asambla are afraid of the proposal for a change in the MWPs (member of the Welsh Council).
This proposal is due to changes in the program so that the name of the sample will be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the Assembly are worried that the political party could become a joke.
One of the employees of Asambla said his group was unsatisfied because "the name belongs to Twp and Pwp."
Welsereen's twp means hot, and pwp is good.
One of the members of the Assembly of Wessels in Istanbul, Plaid Cymru, says that the group "is not happy" and has proposed alternative options.
A Welsh conservationist also says his group is "marked" with regard to change, but notes that the conversion of members of the Welsh Parliament was a short flight of thought.
In this context, the olesian w (dablou) is expressed as the y (u) font in geroxyrical English.
The Assembly of Istanbul, which is currently preparing to present the Constitution on Change, said: "The final decision on any item on the name of the members of the Assembly should certainly be the work of the members.
In 2017, the Welsh government gave Welsh Asamblai the power to change his name.
In June, the Conference announced the results of the general public consultation on proposals, which was very supportive of the Assembly's name, Welsh Parliament.
The Conference supported the members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but MWP received the greatest support from the social council.
It seems that the members of the Asambla are proposing different options, but the struggle to reach agreement can lead to the president's office, Eli Jones, which will probably present the draft bill of changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on legal changes will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the identification of members of the Assembly and the structure of the Assembly.
The members of Asambla will get the final kiss on how to be done when the law is discussed.
Macedonians have started to raise questions in order to change the name of the country
On Thursday, the voters will wonder if they should change their country's name, "The Kingdom of Northern Macedonia."
It was foretold that this famous campaign would solve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which has its own country, Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its north-east neighbour is a requirement for its territory, and I have met with the United States and NATO in a number of ways to join.
President George Ivanos of Macedonia, the anti-communist of change, said he would not declare violence.
However, I have gathered supporters, including Governor Zaw, argue that the change is just a fee for joining the US and NATO.
While there was tension between churches in Harlem, Sab Martin's calls were silent.
- The adults I talked to said that there was a church in every corner, historically, in every corner, and I was a church," said Mr. Adams.
- None of them today.
He said that it was understandable to cancel the halls.
"People are in different ways in our time," he said.
The courts are no longer regarded as guest rooms in the neighborhoods where people go on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he is concerned that income from the sale of actives will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
"Churches," he added, "can be replaced by the buildings of the universe, filled with people who don't help the rest of their neighborhood.
"The pressure of the majority of the people who go to such buildings will be whitewashers," he said, "and so they'll look forward to the day when these churches are closed, because it's less likely that most of these people who move these assemblies will become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by the whites before the Metapolitane community became the black capital of Harlem in 1870, and ten years later, Sab Martín was built.
The real white Methodist convention was released in 1930.
The convention of the swastikas, which was in the vicinity, became the name of the building.
Sab Martin was arrested by the Black Conventioners by the chief of the Holy John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of the bulkheads on the main street of Harlem's warehouses, who himself was opposed to taking or questioning the blacks.
In 1939, Judah suffered great damage to the building, but because Father Johnson's smokers planned to restore it, they were assigned to make calls.
Holy David Jones, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of the Sb Martin Church, calls the calls "the numbers of the poor."
The professor, who called July, called them "citizen property" and "replaceable historical tool."
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that there was the first call in the world, which was heard by black singer Dionysio A. Lind, who replaced the call in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merveder said Seb Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in the last few months around Sab Martín Church was a mess between the clergy and the bishops: some were brought by church leaders, some on the theme of Episcopalism.
The Church of the Presbyterians, the church leader body of July, was concerned about the issue of "to avoid spending," despite the fact that the Church was not involved in paying taxes to the chiefs and chiefs.
Some churches protested the lack of transparency on the part of the subject.
In California, a 13-year-old boy who was forced into the water to catch a shark.
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy who was forced to catch a seagull on the opening day of the season in California, says an official report.
The release took place until 7:00 a.m. in the vicinity of the Bay of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV of San Diego's television that he was hanging out with his friends about half an hour each morning when he heard how a boy was calling for help.
Hamel said he had at first thought it was just the urge to catch the seagull, but then he realized that he was crying.
- They're mad at me.
His fire was completely extinguished,' said Hamel, and he noticed it only when he came to the boy.
"I'm on everybody to get out of the water." "There's a hole in the water!" Hamel added.
The boy was brought to San Diego's childhood clinic, where his condition was severely affected.
The type of abandoned shell was unknown.
The rescuer, Larry Gils, said that the ship was discovered in that area a few weeks ago, but it wasn't seen as dangerous.
Gils added that the victim had received some traumatic injuries in his head.
The officials closed the port of Ecija from Casablad Pontio to Swam for research and security purposes.
Gils added that there are more than 135 species of fish in this area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Seinsbury’s plans include a British beauty market
Seinsbir is involved in the beauty of the stores of Buts (Boots), Superdrug (Superdrug) and Debenhams (Debenhams), along with trained assistants.
As part of an entry of 2.8 billion font starlings in Britain’s beauty market, which continues to grow when its shape and sales of household items are over, the great beauty rooms will be tested in 11 stores in the country and, if they succeed, more stores will be moved next year.
The entrance to the beauty was revealed when the supermarkets began looking for ways to use the areas of televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Seinsbir said it would be rebuffed for the first time by offering beauty to 3,000 animals, including such things as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw:
There will also be a wider range of viewers from Lowell (L'Oreal), Maybelline and Burt's Bees) as well as from Burts.
Supermerckert also re-enacts his boots to the way that most animals are the biological origin, which is growing demand for young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop, which is engaged in the sale of oil, will test the concierges in two Seinsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Craidon, South London, and the last year, Sele in Ocque, Birmingham.
Online shopping, and passing on to local stores with daily breaks, means that supermarkets have a lot to do to convince people to visit them.
The chief executive of Seinsbury, Mike Kup, said that trade chains will be considered as virtual magazines, because the Supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl, with more services and no food.
Seinsbor placed Argos in hundreds of warehouses, also introduced a number of Habits brands, until he bought two networks two years ago, which, in his own words, strengthened the sale of nuclear weapons and made his acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt to change its beauty and medical parts of Supermarket was unsuccessful.
In the beginning of 2000, Seinsby tried to create a joint deal with Buts, but the merger ended with a debate on how to divide income from their supermarket hospital stores.
The new regime was created three years ago when Seinsby sold 125 million pounds of steel to the medical business of his 281 stores to Selesio, who owned the Lloyds Pharmacy network.
It was assumed that Lloyd would have a great role in this program by adding four stores to the quality of the skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy:
Paul Mills-Hich, director of the Chamber of Commerce in Seinsbury, said, "We have transformed the view of our beautiful buildings and sent other food, raising the estety for our audiences.
We also made inputs, and we made special partners who would be able to give advice.
We are designed in our physical nature to meet every demand, and the attractive environment as well as the appropriate location, which means that we are now a professional centre of beauty, which is also a challenge in the old way.
Peter Jones after the 11 million - pound starling plant in Holly Wilba
Last night's Den (Dragons Den) television star, Peter Jones, remained on the watch, when TV broadcaster Hole Wilbai, 11 million pounds of startling, came out of a business that presented his way of life to focus on Marks and Spencer (Marks & Spencer) and his new conditions.
Wilby didn't have time for home clothes and bags, Truly.
The company was like the Goop of the White Pelteros.
This morning, a 37-year-old messenger announced that he would come out in the newspaper.
Holly Wilbey recently left the Night's Day with Peter Jones, and focused on his new, wide-ranging terms with Marks & Spencer.
The sources say that Jones was "scraped" when the television girl, the three-week day in Marlo, the main office of her business in Buchinge, announced 1.5 million pounds of stylling and more about her new business, which meant that she had no more time to support their home clothes and supplies, Truly.
Business was compared to the Gwynett Peltero Goop, and it was designed to recycle 11 million pounds of Wilbe in the future.
When 37-year-old Wilbey announced in the Journal that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and moved to one of his shops.
The source says, "Truly was the top priority of Holly.
It will be his long-term future, which will make it safe to see him in the next few decades.
The decision to get out of him, that is, let everyone know.
No one could believe everything that happened on the three-week day, it was so close to operating.
In the head of Marlo there's a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts are convinced that this morning, one of the most beautiful stars in Britain, is one of the most expensive television shows in Britain, millions of animals, ranging from the heights and the mollusks to the main entrances of clothing and household appliances, as well as the stresses of the next operation.
And that could mean the end of a long-term company.
The three children of Wilby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, had been in close contact with Jones and his wife, Tarah Kafi, for about ten years.
Wilbai founded Truly (Truly) Café in 2016, and Jones became president in March 52.
The couple are resting together, and Jones is the owner of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Wilbai was preparing to become the M&S spaceship and had to replace Ant McPartley as an ITV's "I'm Star" (I'm A Celebrity).
Last night, Jones' neighbors mentioned that we're not going to leave any comments about his business.
After a difficult conversation, we said, "We loved each other."
He was referring to the criticisms that will be given to a comment on the news of Mamule that many would say "no president" and that it is so positious about North Korea's leader.
Why is President Trampa so much assigned?
The crowd shouted, “A messenger of the nations! ”
- I don't give a shit.
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting when after his first meeting in Singapore in June, Tramp took a big step in North Korea's transition.
But there's a war on slowing down.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ray Young John, told the world leaders in the United States on Sunday during the United States National Assembly, that the North does not see the United States' "responsive response" on the issue of the direct military decline in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continues to use means of punishment, namely to preserve the intended burden.
Tramp expressed a much more positive view in his speech.
- We have a great relationship with North Korea.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these wonderful relationships, he said.
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim, had positive results, ended the pilots' trials, helped to free foreign civilians, and finally the American military officers returned home.
And he kept his unusual approach when talking to Kim about relationships.
"It's so easy to be president, but outside, instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this crowded area, we're going to have about 200 people standing right here," said Tramp, pointing at the group standing before him.
The tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia are killing hundreds of lives on the island
After Lomboki's earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were no longer needed.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of Lomboki's population had been displaced, there was no national summit, which would be the first time for international charitable assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it's pretty clear that they won't ask for international aid, so it's a little bit complicated," said Uncle Sambug.
While the Children Protection organization is collecting teams to travel to Palu, they are still not so sure that the foreign team can work in the area.
Commenting on the international disaster consequences management, Mr. Sutopon said that Indonesia's official representatives appreciated the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to implement best practices.
Given that Indonesia is constantly being subjected to pressures, however, the country remains in the areas of nature that are not prepared.
Despite the construction of the tsunami shelters in Akha, they are not the norm for other rocks.
In Palu, the phenomenon of tsunami and even the lack of warning is likely to have contributed to human losses.
In the best case, travel is difficult between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters: delivery is getting much more complicated.
A medical aid ship located in Lamboc, which provided assistance to those who suffered from earthquakes, took the road to Palu, but at least three days will be required to reach the new disaster site.
President Yoko Vidododo Indone's unfavourable infrastructure has made the most important condition of his election preaching, as well as spending money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funding worries Mr. Yoko's team because he's going to be re-elected next year.
There are also problems in Indonesia, where most Muslims have accepted a more conservative way of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and more than 10,000 people have left their homes when Christian and Muslim groups fought along the street using weapons, knives, knives and other combatants.

In Parlament, Cromby's share of "rewriting the story" becomes the last of the story
His destiny will be political justice as the destruction of the cultural and spiritual art of England by his proud Puritan followers.
But Cromby's Union described the proposal of Mr. Crick as "study" and "the attempt to re-write the story."
John Goldsmith, President of the Union of Cromby, said: "It is inevitable that the change to the goal of Oliver Cromby's sharing is beyond the Westminster Palace.
The ideas of the British Civil Wars have not been ordered, nor have they been warned by Croming.
Maybe in the first century, Cromed was wrong to be sacrificed because of his previous actions by Thomas.
The wonderful presentation of Mr. William Hamo Troncroft on the Croming is evidence of a form of 19th-century opinion and historical debate that many still admire.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph. - Crowding is respected by many, of course, more than in the last 19th century than it is today as a protection from external pressures, of course, from unity.
Whether this is completely correct or not, it's also subject to continuous historical discussion.
It is significant that the middle of the 17th century did not prevent the subsequent development of our nation, and Croming is an individually recognized way that represents a part of that division.
His promotions as a priest are also worthy of respect and mention.
A Human Goose Kills Chinese Farmers
In China's local mob reports it's said that in the southwestern market, it's been attacked and killed.
The South China Morning Post reports that on Sunday, at the market at Lupanschi, Guchi, a national named Yuan, was found in a dead condition where the virus was broken and completely covered in blood.
The bourgeois was prepared to order the harvest on May 30, 2005 in China's China-Hinji-Kingha.
On Thursday, he went with his surprise to the next Yuan market to sell 15 bottles.

According to a report, the court trial has found that a 550-pound bullet has caused death to the farmer.
Guyyang Evening News points out: "My cousins were bloody and bloody, "Wu" said the strangest of the nation.
The security cameras had fixed Jonah's entry to the market at 4:40 a.m. to eat his eggs.
His body was discovered an hour later.
The beast that killed Jonah was not worthy of him; neither was he worthy of him.
The Duke of Sweden told Jericho News that they had been shot so that no one would be released until the police found out about the incident.
Yuan's family and market authority are fighting for the death penalty.
In the past, there were few incidents of assault on a man by a bear.
In Moscow in 2016, the dog attacked a woman and her husband in their farm, leaving a man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a six-50-pounded mouse hit the tractor with a Welsh farmer until his wife was able to force him to flee from the fear of the animal.

Puerto Rico's remains will bring plenty of water to the south-west of the United States.
As it is predicted, by moving on the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico, Rosa Potteric is hiding.
Anyway, in the first few days, Rosa will bring a stream of fresh water in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
On the morning of July, at 5:00 a.m., Rose's strength was 85 miles away from Mexico, which is 385 miles away.
It is expected that Rosa will move north in the morning.
At the same time, the Pacific begins to form a river, and it, from the east coast of the United States, has begun to move to the west, because on Tuesday, Rosa will come to the island of Bada California as a spring, which will bring relief from the north of the United States.
On Tuesday, Rosa will bring 10 tons of water to some parts of Mexico.
And then the heat of the sun, in exchange for the water, will bring a wide wave of waters in the south-west on the first day.
In the local sector, 1-4 deep water can be caused by floods, carbicides, and possible leaks.
It's going to be a long winter in time for two or three rain showers, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, there are 2-4 right-wing streams, especially in the great part of Arizona.
Water can be used to break down the conditions of the weather, associated with the dry state of the water.
It would be a terrible mistake to walk through the desert, under the threat of a rising flood.
The cool water can turn water into rivers, and the ampoules will bring strong stones and dust.
The approaching flood will be caused by strong floods in the western parts of South California.
You know, the water of the roof, it's possible to have a cause for the smell and the roads of small stone reactors.
This will be the first spring of this cool season.
In the evening, and in the morning, in the evening, some springing waters will begin to approach Arizona before the water becomes more widespread for two weeks and three weeks.
The fresh water of Thursday will appear in four cannons and continue until Thursday.
In the United States, in October, there may be some intense temperatures of heat, because the Arctic is getting warmer, but the solar system remains too hot.
Sometimes this can cause severe temperature changes in short distances.
The day of July in Central America, there is a good example of warm-up changes.
There are about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and Sab Luis and De Muan.
In the next few days, the heat will be re-examined.
In October, the U.S. central and eastern parts of the United States are expected from the soft beginnings (about 80 degrees) in the south to the north.
On Thursday, the temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
According to our long-term forecasts, there is a great possibility that until the first half of October, the United States will be higher than the middle of the East.
20 More than a million people watched the sound of Brit Cawanau
On Friday, more than 20 million people, six televisions, were watching the court judge of the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanau, and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused him of the sexual depravity of the 1980s.
However, the political opposition continued when the migrants stopped regular shipments on the last minute of the 6th day, and Senator Jeff Blay of Arizona agreed that the Bureau of Investigations (FBI) should be conducting a week's cost check.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent convinced that Kawanau had been raped by alcohol and tried to remove the tears at school's graduation.
Cavanaugh's anger has shown that 100 percent is convinced that it wasn't.
As Nielsen's company reports, probably on Friday, more than 20.4 million people have seen it.
The company calculated the average number of views according to CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that showed that the indicators were not immediately accessible, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen usually has some difficulties when counting the number of people looking at the office.
The number of viewers in this view corresponds to the number of football games or academics.
Fox News, whose public opinion guests have shown strong support for the development of Cavanau's addiction, is a daily average of 5.9 million viewers, says Nielsen.
The ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, interest remained high.
Fly was in the middle of the day's tragedy.
After the presidential office in Cavanau, after the announcement of the ban on the use of Cavanau, viewers of CNN and CBS were directed to the prosecutors when he tried to raise the hearings of the Judicial Committee.
When CNN was moving straight away, he stood up for a few minutes and looked down on the floor, because he felt like he was stuck.
- I'm standing right now in front of you.
- Do you think he's telling the truth?
They said to him, "You have power when many women are powerless," said one woman.
Felix said his office had spread a message, and before closing the doors, he said he'd have much more to say when he heard the committee.
All cable and transmission networks have made direct transfers later when the Judicial Committee has to report to the Senate about the interruption of the Kawana move.
But he said that it would only happen when I realized that the FBI was going to investigate the charges against the prosecutor next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Fly was partly convinced by his friend after talks with Democrat Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to many other senators in Kunsey and later on, Fly made his decision.
Fly's election was strong because it was clear that the Governors would not have any witnesses to establish the Kawanau without investigation.
President Tramp started an FBI investigation on charges against Kawanau.
British Prime Minister Maye, accused of being a "political player" of being accused of being a "political" charge
In his interview with President Teresa May on Sunday Times, he accused his plans to get out of Europe and attack national profits, "political" accusations.

On Wednesday morning, L.A. teacher Will Wade said that the team is "dangerous" and "in shock" from Wade's death news.
"That's exactly what makes you miserable all the time," said Wade.

Don Goo was active in 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalonian conscripts, prior to the Age of Independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday, when the prosecutors met with the police for independence, and thousands of people joined the opposition leaders to mark the first anniversary of the independence of Catalonia.
A group of police officers were chased back, with horses on them, and they were in the streets, with a bunch of black candles that were always worried about the girls.
Later, during the day, the attacks against the police began, and they used the police deaths, for the purpose of the war, to return to the government.
In a few hours, groups fighting for independence sang, "Don't forget, no forgiveness," they met with democracies who shouted, "Land live, Spain."
As the local mob reports, four people were treated with minor injuries during the protest.
A year ago, in the region where there was a lack of confidence, gravity was strengthened when, on October 1, Madrid's capital, was recognized as illegal, but it was celebrated by the desperate Catalans.
The majority of the voters' pressure will burn for independence, even though there was little presence around those who had been bullied against the flux and many of them were bent against it.
According to data from the Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the riot.
On Wednesday night, groups on the side of independence came out to warn the national police.
It was a show, but the show had to take another direction.
68-year-old electric Narciss Termes, who participated in the protest of the kidnappers, said that he no longer sees any hope for the independence of Catalonia.
- Last year we lived one of the best moments of our life.
I saw my parents crying with joy, because they could cry, but now we're rocking."
Despite the difficult statistical victory in last December's district elections, the independence of Catalonia has been fighting to maintain this year's influence, along with their best leaders, who have been imprisoned or tortured because of the organization of the post-independence declaration.
The 42-year-old engineer Juan Puig, who was voting in support of the police on his phone, said that the agreement was threatened by two political actors.
"The fatigue is getting more and more powerful," he said.
On Saturday, Uriel Junker, one of the nine leaders in Catalonia, who had been in court since last year, announced that the next year he would take part in the European Parliament's elections.
"To be in the role of the European electorate, the survey of the national values of the Spanish government's committee is the best way to judge the pressure," he said.
The men were arrested after the car was hit.
33, 34, and 39-year-olds have been robbed when a car hit home in London several times.
It happened on Friday, in Belingrad Crescent, at 19:30 a.m.
Bob Blamings, who was seen in the department, said it's harmful to the walls of the house and the building itself.
It's possible that some of the car's hits have also been damaged.
In playing with Rangers, Menga's attack won 1-0 on Livington.
Dolly Mangan’s first goal was to secure the victory of Livington
The development of Livington led to Rangers' transfer to Steven Gerard, the leader of the Ibroke Group, who was involved in 18 games with the cause of his second debt.
Dolly Mangan's attack seemed to be different from Gary Holt, reaching the second level of Hebron.
This Premier Liga was lost in victory by Jerard, and the next day they meet with the Premier Wart, who remains with eight of them.
In the meantime, on Friday, Rapid Winna was expecting Rengers in the League of Europe.
Livingstone, who was with Holt's main teacher in six games, was in debt for as long as the teacher was replaced by Kenny Miller.
Livingstone opened up his chances before the visitors.
Before the ball hit, Holt's team had to be in front of them, causing many problems for Rangers immediately.
Scott Robinson went ahead, and no effort was made to break down, and then Alan Littlegon was able to direct all his efforts to a long shot, meeting Craig Holkert's head.
The consenting party was happy to let Rangers play in front of him, knowing that they could cause concern to visitors in certain areas.
And that's the way it broke down the decisive ball.
Rengers was able to get rid of the free strike, and Livingstone worked for the opening of the account, and Dekela Gallagre and Robinson were trying to block Menga, who accepted the strike and brought the hit from the center to the ground.
In this valley, Rangers had a position of authority, and the protection of their back was ineffective, and vice versa, Liam Kellin.
That part of the game was kept until you played second, even though Alfredo Morelos broke Kelly's security.
Scott Pittman was attacked by the Rangers, by Alan McGregor, and by another player in Livingstone.
After two rounds, one of which was the replacement of Holkit with Glam Midelton, the other hand for the game, the violent attacks on the part of Livingstone continued to be repeated.
-Fenomial,--examinations from Livingstone.
Alessadir Lamont for the Scottish BBC from the Queen of Tony McCaronne
The impossible game and the outcome for Livingstone.
According to one man, they were more than even to be desired.
After the horizontal movement, the number of players and the number of players has changed significantly, but it's very good for Holty, because the team has been replaced after her arrival.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket had done a great job in creating strong protection, and during that time Menga was watching Conor Goldson and Joe Waolin.
However, Rangers' spirits were short-lived.
Although they played well with Gerard, they didn't match the standards.
Their final absence and their one-year opening was a wake-up call for Rangers to appear in the middle of the conflict.
Erdola was accepted by the priest in Kyle
The whites and black clouds were on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin early this morning.
This was the last day of the negative visit of President Erdola, Germany, which was intended to organize relations between NATO agents.
They discussed a number of questions, including human rights, the freedom of the mob and the entry of Turkey to the U.S.
And then Erdola went to Kyle to participate in the opening of a large museum.
This city is a home for a large Turkish population living outside Turkey.
The police had taken security means to close the gate of a 25,000 group, but many supporters were able to see their president close.
Hundreds of protestors, many of whom were brothers, also heard their voice being judged by Erdola's politics and the decision of the German government to take him into the country.
The hot-tempered votes were displayed by some German Turks, to visit as a non-responsibility to admit the hero, and to insult him as a self-propriet.
There was a car on Deftford’s way, and the driver died from a car crash
In London, a car driver died.
The fourth took place at 10:15 at the local time, along the narrow road of the city of Deftford, in the southeastern part of the city, along the narrow road of Bestedwood and Evein.
The driver of the car stopped, and in the presence of the witnesses, the man died in the scene.

The mayor's police say they work to clear up men's identity and inform their neighbors.
The road is closed, and bus traffic directions have changed, and drivers have been encouraged to avoid this area.

The spas were shown to help with small facial injuries.
- Long Lard has been taken to prison by a special prison staff to slow down the ongoing media.
Six members of the team have been treated.

Long Lart has more than 500 prisoners, including some very dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was getting hospital treatment because of his attack by the prisoner.
In October last year, they called for the czars to be put in prison to eliminate the serious indiscriminateness that they had forced the crew to leave the camp on foot.
Puerto Rico is threatened by floods in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City
For the eastern cycle, the damage to Arizona is minimal, but that's what's likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy of Rosa Potter is going to be transferred to the Southwest desert, which may be due to water.
The Service of the National Council of Greece has already considered the possibility of a flood on two weeks and three weeks from West Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South California and Jutta, including the cities of Finland, Flagsof, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take her way to Phoenix three weeks later, with evening rains.
The National Office of Finance in Twitter stated that "from the beginning of 1950, 200 miles away from Phoenix, only ten cyclones have maintained the status of the Eastern Houses.
In 1967, Katharina was moving at 40 miles [40 km] to Arizona's border."
The last models of the National Portuguese Centre are predicting 2 to 4 degrees of water flow, up to 6 degrees of water, in Arizona's Mogolo Rim.
Other areas of the Suswest desert, including Roque and Great Basin, are likely to get 1-2 drop of water, which is possible by 4 knots.
For areas that remain safe from the danger of water, Rosa can be a blessing, because the area is at risk of famine.
Although the water is a serious concern, these streams are likely to be useful to the Soviet Union, which is now under the threat of famine.
According to a report from the U.S. site weather.com, "As a result of a flood, more than 40 percent of Arizona is at risk of the next high risk."
From the beginning, Portugal's route to Russia is heading from the island of Badya to the coast of Mexico.
In the morning, in the morning, with a still strong force, 85 miles per hour at the maximum force, 385 miles south of Ponta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour to the north.
Kamin lies on the cold waters of the Peace Ocean, and therefore his strength is stronger.
So it is expected that you will be in Mexico in the afternoon or in the evening, due to the power of the east wind.
In some parts of Mexico, water is going to be toxic, which can lead to serious water problems.
What happens to weather.com. "There are 3-6 layers of water expected from Bay California to north-west Sonora, possibly up to 10 degrees."
And then Rosa's bed in the north of Mexico as a sunset, until she reaches Arizona's border at three o'clock in the morning, and then three weeks in the evening she's going to get Arizona and South Judah.
- The biggest danger of Russia or its remnants is the hottest floods in Bada California, the North-West of the United States and the Southwest of the island of Southwest, reports the Centre of National Potters.
It is expected that these waters will lead to life-threatening floods and droughts in the deserts, as well as floods in the mountains.
I was sent to Mitsomer Norton, where four victims of rape were arrested.
A three-and-a-half-year-old man was arrested for murder, suspected of finding a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.

Tramp says that the Kawanon Democratic Society has become “a victim of cruelty, anger. ”
"To fight for the sake of Judge Kawan, which means to fight against the incompetence and incompetence of the Democratic Union," said Tramp at a council in Willing, West Virginia.
The team said that Kawana has become the victim of the "flammation and anger" of the Democratic Assembly throughout the course of its conquest.
On Friday, Kawana gave a witness to Congress in a harsh and emotional way, accusing Christine of being accused of having committed sexual harassment years ago.
Ford also testified in court after hearing of his charges.
The president said on the Sabbath, "The Americans saw the wisdom, the qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
Judge Kawana's choice is that one of the most prolific and legitimate thinkers of our time, with a broad knowledge of social services -- she announced to a group of members of West Virginia.
During the mid-term elections, the president spoke about the development of Kawan, when he spoke about the importance of the governing assembly.
- We've been making the most important choices in our life for five weeks.
I'm not going to do it, but I'm actually going to do it.
That's why I fight so hard for the good guys," he said.
The team claimed that democracies have a duty to "disstand and oppose".
The representative of the government of the Grand Chamber (the Supreme Court) told the CNN that the first major technical elections in Ghana are expected in Senate not later than Thursday.
The decent people have become together with the sacrifice of Hindu torture and tsunami, with the loss of vision.
It was reported that on the weekend, at least 384 people were killed by the massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Solavis, which struck many with massive floods.
A crowd gathered in one of the streets of Palaú to attend the festival on Friday, when six meters (18 feet) of the hill hit the beach and went along the streets to destroy everything that appeared on its way.
It's followed by 7.5 ball power to the ground floor.
During the earthquake in Jakarta, the representative of the company BNPB, who was suffering from the Indian disaster, said that on the night of the tsunami disaster, people continued to rest their lives and did not run away from it, which led to their death.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it quickly gave him cars, cars, homes, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugrohon, adding that until the storm hit the sea at 800 km/h (497 m/h) speed.
Some people have raised trees to protect from the tsunami, and they're all gone," he said.
About 16700 people were distributed to 24 centers of Palu.
The planes are shown in photos of the air-scraped organization, where many destroyed houses and warehouses are destroyed, destroyed walls, and a pool surrounded by water.
The raids continued to take place in coastal areas on the same weekday.
The magnitude of the outbreaks has also been observed in the area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
In a BPPT statement on technology assessment and application, the energy released as a result of the massive earthquake of the 6th day was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb power of the second world war on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
It's said that the city's global position, which lies at the end of a long, difficult valley, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
The damage suffered by Nugroho has been appreciated by thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
Some victims' bodies were found under the walls of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 people were unconscious.
Nugroho said that victims and victims could be larger in the water zone, 300 miles [300 km] from Palu to the northern area of Dongala, which is closer to the earth's epicenter.
The communications in Donegal were "indistinctly indistinct," Nugrohon said.
The Red Claw said there were more than 300,000 people living there, adding that the crew and volunteers were headed in the affected areas.
It's said it's already a tragedy, but everything could have been worse.
On Tuesday, the organization was severely criticized for not keeping up with the tsunami in Palu, even though the killers said they had reached the waves when the warning had not yet arrived.
A love magazine, which was posted on the Internet, reports that the man at the store is the same as the man at the front of the house calling people on the street on the front street.
Over the years, the wall of water falls on the rock, taking its roofs and cars.
Reuters's operation failed to slow down the vote.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive wave of power, which made it impossible to communicate around Palu, which made it difficult for the government to send conornates to the rescue forces.
The authorities say that the army has begun to send aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still feel the need for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been restored only for auxiliary forces, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Woodon planned to visit Palu's distribution centers on Tuesday.
In Indonesia, the number of tsunami victims has exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Until the World Vision of the World Trade Organization arrived in Palu, where workers were safely placed in their warehouses of wood-made warehouses, they were looking at their way through the streets, said Mr. Dasebana.
They told me they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief teams started the violent process of installing disaster relief devices, some complained that foreign relief teams who were better informed of them had prevented Paul from traveling.
According to the Indonesian law, financing, aid and employment can only begin if the area of disaster is declared to be the cause of national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still considered a state-level disaster," said Ullia Ariana, "and the Indian Red Crescent Man's speech.
The government itself says, "Lava, this is a national disaster," we can get international aid, but we still don't have the right to it.
On the second night, after the earthquake and after the tsunami, families and friends of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the marvels that had left them painfully because of natural disasters.
On the Sabbath, a little boy was taken out of bed.
On Tuesday the survivors took out a woman who had spent two days beside her mother's body.
The teacher of the Indonesian national parapolango team, Jend Subanon, was trained in two of the missing Palestinians in front of the Asian games that had taken place in Indonesia earlier that month.
The rest of Roa Roa's guests, Mr. Manggy, were his students.
"As a parapolanga expert, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Jendn tells us how he sent messages to the Palanists about the flow of Roa Roa Roa's tour, hours after the announcements were broadcast, to the Palu's relatives who participated in the holiday.
But his messages were received by only one observatory instead of two layers.
"I guess it means that the messages have not arrived," he said.

Canya West: Reef has changed his name to Ye
Reef Cany West changes his name to Ye.
On Sunday, he wrote about the change in Twitter, saying, "Get officially known as Kanye West."
Well, 41-year-old West took Ya Majun for a while and made it the title of his eighth album, which he saw in June.
The change comes with success on the weekend at night, where his new album had to be released.
"It replaces Ariana Grandine, who had not thought of his speech "because of the ammo," said the director of the show.
In addition to his current reputation, West mentioned that the word has religious significance.
"I think "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you" -- this year, Westt, radio broadcaster Big Boe, was discussing his album's title.
- So, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's spread out from Canada, which means only Y, and it's becoming our good, bad, bad expression, everything.
The album is more like our real self.
He's part of the desire for famous riffers who have changed their name.
Shoon Combs has been well-known as Puff Deed, P.D. or D.D., but this year he announced his preamble to the names "Ser" and "Brotherly Love".
JJ-ZIN, also associated with West, wrote his name in charts and sizes or without them.
President Andres Manuel Lod Obrador of Mexico has vowed not to use the army against the citizens.
President Andres Manuel Lod Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military forces against citizens, because the country is approaching 50 years of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelololoco University, Lod Obrador promised never to use military forces to force Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, during the post-commissioning peace show, nearly 300 people were killed, when students were widely scattered throughout Latin America.
Rod Obrador promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those who are studying and by establishing more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education make it possible for young people to become a member of a gang.
The U.S. needs to refinance artificial intelligence
"As China is even more active in the field of artistic intelligence, the United States needs to reimburse the money it spends in that field for research work," said the artist's operational expert, Kai Fu Lin, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments are made after the various parts of the U.S. government have made statements about artistic intelligence, while the United States has no formal objection to artificial intelligence.
At the same time last year, China has presented its programme, their goal is to become the first in the field of artistic intelligence in 2030.
"The restoration of the bogey of industrial intelligence research is a good start, given that the United States is quite advanced from other countries, and we are looking forward to the next step in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
This week's interview with the CNBC revealed that the refinancing can repeat the next major increase that the United States will achieve in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lin, chief executive director of Sinovation Ventures, in which the book "Treaties of the Art of Art, China, Silicon Day and New World Order" was published this month by Hutt Mifley Harcourt, in one of China's most famous art intellectuals organizations, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melone worked on an artistic intelligence program that won the highest-ranking American role, Oteleo. Then he became the executive director of Microsoft Research and the head of the Chinese branch of Google.
He accepted the combinations of former U.S. government technology, such as the robotic statements of the Organization for the Protection of Exploitation Projects, and asked when the next would be to help identify the next creations.
- U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
"He's taking the academic leaders, not China, but the corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technological organizations have, over the past few years, accepted the work of famous experts from universities to work on artistic intelligence.
Lyn said the change in civil society can also help the United States strengthen efforts in the field of artistic intelligence.
"I think it's time for a letter to be offered to doctors of the philosophy of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, China's National Council introduced its next generation's artistic intelligence development programme.
"The National Institute of Natural Sciences in China finances those who belong to academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, to fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," he said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department established an Autonomous Intelligence Centre in Hamada, which is intended to include business partners from both universities and academics, and the White House announced the establishment of the Convention for the Selective Aesthetics.
And this month, Darpa announced that $2 billion was committed for a venture called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently includes more than $100 million per year in artistic intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation that seeks to create at the National Conference on the National Security of the Austrian Intellectics has nothing to do with the months.
Macedonians are busy “to change the name of the document ”
On Thursday, the Macedonians gathered to ask whether it was necessary to change the name of the country, "The Kingdom of Northern Macedonia", a step that would help solve the conflict with Greece, which had been a barrier to its European and NATO presence for years.
Greece, which has a state of Macedonia, claims that putting that name in its north-east neighborhood means that it is in possession of its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and Europe.
The two governments would have signed a new name proposed in June, but ethnic opposers argue that the change would destroy the ethnicity of the majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanon has announced that he will not participate in the polling, and there have been doubts about whether the participation will meet at least 50 percent in order to be counted.
The question of Thursday was, "Do you agree to the NATO and the European membership and the accession of Greece?"
The parties to the Reformation, including Governor Zaw, argue that it is the wine to be a full member of the NATO or of the European Union for Macedonia, which was among the countries that were able to exist after the revolution of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today for the future of the country, in Macedonia's youth, for the future of Europe's welfare, because it means a more secure life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgia in Skopje.
Although it is not a regular duty, enough members of the board have said that they will be opposed to the consequences of fraud in order to make it a decision.
The change requires the general part of the majority of the council.
The presidential election conference said there had been no reports of irregularities until an hour.
But the participation in the elections was 16 percent compared to 34 percent of the 2016 elections, when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I've come to celebrate my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Goose Tanevsky, the capital of Scotland.
On September 30, 2018 in Stremika, Macedonia, the governor of Macedonia, Zoran Zaw, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko, have completed their quarterlys in gathering to change the name of Macedonia, thus speeding up the state road to NATO and Europe.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kadarkar was preparing a small beer and quickly placed in front of the tents that had been placed there by a person who was being gathered against them.
- We're on the side of NATO and Europe, but we want to be proud to join them, not from the front door.
-We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can face China and Russia and become part of European integration," said the Guardian.
President Zaw says NATO's membership in Macedonia will make significant contributions, where the level of unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think most pressure will be on the side, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are on NATO and Europe," said Zaw after completing his quarter.
And he said, "Yes," the answer would be, "You're going to have a wonderful future."
According to the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Tuesday, 30 to 43 percent of the respondents have been polled, which is less than what they need.
According to another question on Telma TV, 57 percent of Macedonia is still preparing to burn on Sunday.
Seventy-seven percent of them said it's going to work.
To be successful, participation needs to be 50 percent and one voice.
The collapse of the republic will be the first major attack on Western government since May.
The Manchester City of Sergio Aguiron won the entire defense of Britney to attack the castle.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were released from British protection in the 2-0 count of Manchester City, which took place on Thursday in England in the Manchester Etreading.
Aguero made it easy for the 65-minute-long game to feel like he's stuck in his throat.
Argentinian attack took place in the center of the field at the beginning of the game.
He jumped through the three defenses of Britney until he entered the free zone.
After Aguron, he was surrounded by four green squabbles.
He turned around one, and then he went back to Britney's back.
And then he transferred to Sterling, who was left of him.
When the English attacker arrived at the airport, he moved the train back to Aguero, who hit the train with his right leg, giving it direction to the Brittany-based Matthew Ryan, and the train to the right-hand corner of the train.
"Aguarone has some problems with his feet," said the editors of the City of Pep Gabriela.
We've been talking about her playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Our experience has shown that he was able to write a good one at that time.
But Sky Blues gave the original advantage to Sterling in Premier Ligae.
That ball was written in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguero got a bullet in the middle of Britney's game.
He made a beautiful transfer to Leo Seine on the left.
Seine did a few jobs, then she passed the Sterling, which was on the other side of the field.
The chess blouses put the ball in the trunk until the boundaries are cut.
Sitin's gonna go out against Hoffenheim at the top of the champion's league game on Wednesday, 12:55 p.m. in Reynn-Negar, in the town of Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to win an unexpected victory against Roki.
Because the Napoleons were out of the game, it was impossible to start again.
But with a spirit of competition, the Cherzers have the hope of coming out against the Colorado Rocky Day, but only if it is possible to organize a game with Roki who will play against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies have given them a place on Friday, winning five or two games against the Nationals, but they still have the hope of keeping their first title.
Although we're playing for nothing, we can jump down the ladder, confident that the Danver environment and group will also be the opposite team at the highest level I'm going to meet this year.
Why didn't I want to get involved in all of this?
The Nationals still have to start on Sunday, but as they say, they're willing to let Scherser show up in this situation.
Sherzer, who had to do his 34th attack, threw the bullet on Friday, and he'll be back on his usual rest on Sunday.
The right hand of Washington is 18-7 from 2.53 ERA and 300 out of 220 2⁄3 to the moon.
The tramp is in West Virginia.
The president made an indiscriminate contribution to the selection of his senior adviser, Brett Kawana, during a speech on the importance of the internal elections.
Everything we've done will be in danger of November.
Our most important choices in life have been five weeks.
"It's one of the biggest, the biggest choices. I'm not going to make it, but I'm actually going to make it, and that's why I'm fighting so much for the good guys," she said.
The band went on. You see this terrible, horrible radical group of democracies, you see how it happens now.
And they're ready to go back to power all the time, and you'll see the balance and the distance.
They don't want to know who they're hurting, who they have to go through to get power and power, that's what they need, and we're not willing to give them.
"Democrats," he said, "have the duty to oppose and oppose.
And you see it during these four days, he called the Democrats angry, corrupt, immoral and lying people.
He's been urging the Senate's judicial committee Democrat, Sen, to call Dean Fensitin, who's in high school.
Do you remember his answer?
Have you fulfilled the statement of the document?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for someone... it was a very bad body language... the most faithful body language I've ever seen.
The Liberian community is no longer a large church.
It's very unpleasant for those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum's activists threw me into a local facility, it wasn't surprising.
Finally, I'm the last person in the way of the Liberian Society's reporters who could say that they're not happy to see us here... and that's all for expressing our thoughts.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, of the Council, showed a similar attitude because she was determined to stand firm against anti-aestheticism.
As for me, I was accused by the prosecutors because I opposed Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and the status quo is due to similar problems that were not in harmony with the former leaders around Jerome.
"We want meetings to be meaningful and effective."
For most of the eight years I've been in charge of the local labor union, the GC congregations on Friday were just like that.
It's sad that many congregations today are not like this, and "better good and honest" politics has already been forgotten, if it's ever been.
El has made it even more clear that there are no different views in the Liberian Federation, and everyone's opinion is considered to be acceptable or unacceptable by the board's leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremiah's leadership, when my colleagues, who I thought shared my views on unity, began to expect me to change my views and have ideas that I would never agree with... whether it was national security or the United States market.
I have a public talk (and it doesn't matter what I say) on social networks, it's following the level of abuses called, and re-electing, judging central politics, and telling me I don't have the right to be in the Liberian community.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more successful than some of my colleagues because the comments I made are political.
I'm surprised at the behavior and determination of my colleagues who suffer from sexual or racist abuses every day, but they never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political century is how the levels of injury have become normal.
Jeremy Corby announced last week that the Liberian community should be involved in the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that expanded church, and all "trust" moves or changes in the rules of elections become more personal.
Over the past two years, I've been advised to put my head down many times, not so much, and in that case it'll be good for me.
But I didn't get into politics to do it.
Since 32 years ago, when I joined the Liberians as a school student because of being ignored by the Tetek government, which made my school class in a literal confusion, I also began trying to provide better public services to those who need it most, to be less than a local council, or the head of government.
I've never left my politics, the last elections are no exception.
There's no one in the East Nothinheim who's confusing my political views and the differences with the leaders today.
All I'm going to say to those who move on Friday, is that when the country moves to Brixist, which will lead to home economy, business and our public services, I don't understand the desire to break my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian device.
But in fact, my only statement is not about the Montmentum of Nottinheim, but about my side, whether or not, whether or not, I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no elections will threaten me, or that political expectations will not prevent me from doing what I find to be of the interests of all of you.

Er 38-17 Melrose is rising above the imperishable Earth.
The last two experiments could have changed the final outcome somehow, but Err was certainly worth winning this wonderful and fun day of the Tenant Premiers.
They're on the table now, on the only side of the 10th floor.
In the end, it was their supreme protection, as well as the success that the winner gave to the host, and the conqueror Peter Murky had the right to be fully satisfied.
We've been tried during these games, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
From Melrose, Robin Cristy said, "Apriety Ery," they used their options better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute hit by Frasier Yützs first prompted Erry, but during the time of the Scotland War, Rory Yützs' doctor's card, which he had received for the game with the Vorriers, gave Melrose the opportunity to add the account, and Jason Begott was hit by a fatal blow.
Climony so far extended it to the top of Ery's head with a tugan. After the middle of the time, he was actually one, then he tried to do the only hit to make the count for Ery's 17-5.
But Melros started the second player well, and Patrick Anderson's attack, which had passed the Beggot, reduced the accounting difference by five units.
Then it stopped for a long time, because of the serious injury of Rurid Nott, he was removed, and after his return, Err passed away by himself through the attacks of Stafford McDowell.
Captain Blair Macperson, who worked for Ery, got a doctor's card at that time, and Melrose was hit by an additional attack on Bruce Colwin at the end of the war.
The welcome party, however, came back, and when Strava Hutchinson got the doctor's card to Klimo because he had to get out of the wheelchair, MacPerson got on the front line before Ery.
Climbon attacked, as he had just started, and then Kyle Roo stopped David Armstrong's attack and sent flicker Gregor Henry away to tell him the fifth attack on the host.
Still Game's star is ready to start a new career in the restaurant.
Still Game's star Ford Kiera is ready to move to the guest area after it became clear that he became the owner of a designated restaurant company.
He's been playing Jack Jarvis's role in a famous BBC show, where he writes and portrays his former partner, Greg Hemphill.
The storm has announced that the 9th series expected in advance will be the last series of communications, and it has been shown that Kierna is preparing to plan her life after the United Kingdom.
According to official lists, he's in charge of Edreftmor Limitid.
Daresan refused to explain the story, despite the Scottish Sun source that Kierna would like to be included in the Gluzgo's "float restaurant store".
The sea is ours -- Bolivia, surrounded by the Samak, hopes that the court will turn its way to the Pacific.
The ships keep La Paz's military base.
The public buildings have removed the ocean floor.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, it's a dictionary of military camps, and it's our law of the sea.
It's our duty to restore it.
In Bolivia, the capital city, there was still a fire in the 19th century when there was a bloody conflict with Chile's resources, the memory of Chile's loss of water line, as well as the ability to sail once again on the Pacific.
These hopes may be at the highest level over the past ten years, because Bolivia is waiting for the final decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1st.
"Bolivia has a goal, it has a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, looks forward to a good end," said Bolivian designer Roberto Calzadilla.
Most of the Bolivians will see the U.S. decision to show all the major screens of the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal would be next to Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to fight Bolivia and give it freedom to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's local charismatic president, who is now fighting for election next year, has also played a decisive role in the decision made on Tuesday.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific -- he promised the end of August.
But some researchers think that the court's decision would not be for the benefit of Bolivia, and that would change little if it were.
The U.S. body in the Netherlands has no control over Chile's areas, and he said it will not determine the outcome of the possible wars.
Because the U.S.'s decision comes six months after hearing of the final objections, it shows that the work was "not bad," according to Chile's expert Paz Zarat on international law.
And since the post-Bolivia process, it could have been delayed for the past four years.
"The problem of freedom of passage to the sea of Bolivia has been ignored by the current government of Ebolivia," said Sharat.
Moralise's military statement was the reason that the last remnants of Chile's charity disappeared.
Finally, Bolivia and Chile will continue to communicate one day, but after that the discussions will be very difficult.
The two countries have not been replaced by diplomas since 1962.
In Hague, the former president of Bolivia and former president of the country Eduardo Rodrigues Wellssen rejected the idea that the court had decided immediately.
On Tuesday, Bolivia's "extraordinary opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile" and the opportunity to "end up with 139-year-old disagreements on double."
Calzadilla also noted that Morales, one of the most famous presidents of Latin America, used the sea problem as a political entity.
"Bolivia will never be denied freedom from the Gulf of Peace," he added.
The marking gives us the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says that there will be no middle-arming until the United States will inspire confidence.
R. Young John, president of North Korea's external affairs, says his people will never fight the middle army until he can trust Washington.
Ri had a talk on Sunday in the U.S. capital congregation.
He called on the United States to follow the promises he had made at the summit of the opposition leaders in Singapore.
His comments come from the United States: the British ambassador Michael Pompone, seems to be with Kim Chen Yun, North Korea, after more than three months of the re-examination of the Central Central Development of Singapore.
Rey says it's a "serious dream" that continues to use punishments, and it's never going to bring the attention to North Korea's declaration of the end of the U.S. Korean War.
Washington warns to agree with the statement without the important step of military defeat of Pong.
And Kim, and U.S. President Donald Tramp wants a second summit.
But there is widespread mistrust that Pong is seriously concerned with the refusal of arms, which the country may consider to be the only means of guaranteeing security.
Pompey is going to visit Pong next month to prepare for the next Kim-Tramp summit.
The Paris exhibition presented a new set of chapters, which will soon be in the Hye Street near you.
If you want to expand your heads and protect you completely from the rays of the sun, that's what you need.
The scholars Valentino and Tom Brown presented their new collection of SS19 great-grandchildren during the week of Paris's resurgence, and it surprised everyone.
A lot of unskilled heads have become this summer's editorial stream, and these designs have sent their eye-browsing creatures into the podium.
Valentino's most sophisticated collection was the big body head at the wide end of the drilling, which was broken down into the model head.
And so many more ecsessors include the walnuts, the hatheads, and even the royal tools -- but they're not meant to keep your head dry.
Tom Brown also showed the selection of exits, just in front of Halloween.
Many of the colorful faces had to be reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter's memories of more than a higher income.
One creature reminded me of a fire-fighting machine, along with his bow and tails, while the other was like a fighter.
And if you continue the high declaration of his form, you'll be successful.
Passive viewers predict that huge screens can soon be revealed in your main streets.
The larger heads were followed by "La Bomba," and at the end of two feet by two feet by two feet, the red head was noticed by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkevsky.
One of the most inexhaustible forms of worship in the world, one of the most popular social media, sent another great creation in the podium, a red light bulb, which was almost as large as the popular model
Mugh's most popular ruffy, a white and hidden, will be counted by violence, the most disrespectful of the SS 19 collection of Paris during the week of his form.
Astrologer Luke Hermiage told the F.F.
John Edward, language skills are too important for global citizens.
The independent schools of Scotland keep record of academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with another amazing series of tests, which has been reinforced only by individual and collective achievements, in sports, art, music and other social activities.
In Scotland, with more than 30,000 students, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are reaching out to give their students and parents the highest level of service.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for later and higher education, their choice of careers and their place as a global citizen.
As a school area that can plan and implement a pre-existing educational plan, we see that languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said that if you talk to a man in a language that he can understand, it's going to be his head.
If you talk to a person in his own language, it'll touch his heart.
This reminds us that we can't just be in English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As a result of this year's examination, we can see that languages are at the top of the lingua franca, which is the largest percentage of those who have gone through school, regardless of their schools.
68 percent of the students who have learned other languages have received a higher rate of A.
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS shows that 72 percent of students have received from the highest value A in Mandar, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent French students and 63 percent Spanish students have also received A.
This shows that regardless of the schools in Scotland, foreign languages are needed as skills that will undoubtedly benefit children and young people in the future.
Now in schools, regardless of language, it's the same way as STEM devices (knowledge, technology, mathematics and mathematics).
In 2014, the United Kingdom’s project on skills and skills revealed the reasons why employers find it difficult to complete jobs, 17 percent of which are recorded in the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills have become a major part of the world’s knowledge of the language.
Regardless of the career they've chosen, if they've learned a second language, they'll have real satisfaction in the future, ruling to the end of life, what this is.
Being able to communicate with foreign people before a couple of languages is mechanically related to a man.
According to YouGov’s 2013 issue, 75 percent of the 4,000 adults in Britain were unable to speak in a foreign language to the extent that they could communicate, and France was the only language spoken by a heavenly percentage of 15 percent.
That's why it's important for today's children to be involved in teaching languages.
Taking control of a number of languages, especially in developing countries with economies, will allow children to find meaningful work.
Every school in Scotland will be divided into its languages.
A number of schools will focus on more educational languages, while the rest will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in 2020. Such languages are Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, regardless of school, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose, and the school staff are experts in this field.
The aim of the Scotlandn independent schools is to provide a educational environment that will provide children and build them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what they expect in the future.
Now, in this global business environment, we can't pretend that languages continue to remain really important for the future of a country, so this should be shown in education.
However, the language really needs to be considered "national communication skills."
Schools will continue to offer young Scottish students this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scotland Independent Schools Council.
Lebron has to carry out Lakers' debout on Sunday in San Diego.
The prospect of seeing Le Bron James ’ debulletion, in Los Angeles, nears its end.
Lakers' teacher Luke Wellton has announced that James will play the opening of the premise tomorrow against the Danver Naggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play, he'll have to decide.
"It's going to be a minute, but it's not 48," said Wellton on Lakers' official website.
Michael Trudelle, from Lakers' paper, said that James would probably play a limited minute.
Following a discussion this week earlier, James asked about his plans for the six-game pre-station graph.
"In this career of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prove," he said.
Tramph of West Virginia, Utubya Alik
President Donald Trampe starts tonight's pre-election campaign in Willing City of West Virginia.
This is the first of the five councils scheduled for the next week of Tramp, including the branches in the friendly areas, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In order to complete the post office in the Supreme Court, Tramp tried to build support for the previous inter-elections because the presidents are ready to lose control of Congress, while the votes will be counted in November.
What time is it to be in West Virginia, and how can it be seen online?
The town of Tramp is scheduled to be held in Wieling, West Virginia, at 7 o'clock in the evening. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trampi, a town in West Virginia with the Yutubian straight lines below.
The team will probably talk this week about the hearings of the Supreme Court, Brett Kawana, who has been accused of having committed a serious sexual misconduct, bringing him to trial for one week after the Senate's arrest.
But the main goal of these speakers is to help the authorities who are standing before the elections held in November to get a driving force.
Thus, President Tramp said that the 5 graduates of the next week “are seeking to employ volunteers and supporters, while the presidents are trying to protect and expand the majority of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” reports Roberts.
"The control of Congress is so important to its system that the president will travel as many countries as possible as possible until we enter the preaching season,"-Tramp's evangelical speech, which was refused to mention his name, according to Reuters.
Today's conference in Willingi Wesbenko Arena can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and from Pittsburgh's press media, according to Metro News of West Virginia.
In the last month, it will be the second day of the week, when Tramp visits West Virginia, where he won over 40 percent of the units in 2016.
The tramp is trying to help Patrick Morsey, President of West Virginia, who is listed in the list.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president has come to try to vote," said Simon Hader, who is political scientist at West Virginia University.
The U.S. team was confident that the hopes will remain alive until tomorrow's game.
After the three sessions, the afternoon after noon, the quarter could be just what this Rader had needed.
The driving force is a fully-fledged sports idea that players really believe and never more than during such conversations.
So they say, where is the driving force now?
"They've got 6 units plus 4 now, and I think we're keeping it as a little moving force," said Jordan Sfett when he was working that day.
Europe certainly has 4 units of excellence, and 12 still have to play.
The Americans, as Smith says, feel that there's a little bit of room in their pockets, even though they have a lot to breathe, not lacking in the form of Smith and Justin Thomas, who have played with each other all day, and each of them has increased from three to four.
Sparta was going to die during Tee to Green and led by example.
The peaks of the tax collection were even stronger than his race continued, and he was hit by a decisive attack to get the right to participate in the game with four fields, when he and Thomas fought both after two.
His attack, which brought them victory, was combined with a 15-point match, a type that tells you that the American team believes it's not out of this.
"You have to work more and worry about your game only," Sfit said.
That's what each of these players left now.
18 times, for the mark.
The only players who have more unity than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinary and Tommy Flitfoud, the incredible story of the radar.
It's strange in Europe, but it's 4 out of 4 and it can't be wrong.
The Molywood was the only couple who didn't sleep on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, on Thursday afternoon, and on the golf course on Thursday morning.
That speed and how their energy seemed to go back and forth to the mob of that hate, it confirms that they were players who had to win on Friday, and there was no more famous player than Flytford or Molinary, whose wife's pontential European winner, until the sun goes into Le Golf Nazioneal,
It's preferable that both be at the same time, in different stages.
But the talks about European glory are still early.
Bobba Watson and Webb Simpson wrote a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning golfer when he was a friend of Alex Knorr.
One bogey and two doubles moved the first nine to Spain and Sweden to the passage from which they had never been successful.
On Tuesday, however, no one can help you get out of your leg.
It's so interesting to see the four corners and the squares close together, their relationships, their advice, their unintended advice, and how the competition can change in a moment.
Europe as a team has played a lot better this time and has had a remarkable advance until the final day, but the series of cards has shown that the U.S. team has shown a spirit that no one, especially St.
On the final day of the radar, Europe had a 10-6 in advance.
By the end of the day of the radar, Europe will have a great advantage because of the 10-6 U.S. bill of football and football.
The inspired Tommy Flitwood and the French Moliner couple changed the game's number by two victories, against the opponent Tiger Wooder, to reach their claim until the same time as the La Golf National 4 unit.
Thomas Burne's European side, who was trying to get back to Heselton two years ago, came by government at 3:1 in the morning game.
The United States has shown greater resistance during the game, but they have failed to win.
Jim Fury needs eight single games a day to get back to the cave.
Flytford is the first player in Europe who has been able to make 4 units after each other, until he and Mollinary, who have received the name "Molwood" after the rest of the holiday, are only two of the couples who have won by four in their first four games in the history of Rayder Gawatt.
After Woods and Patrick Reid in four rounds, they worked hard to make Woods and the American player Bruce Dechambe, more than 5-4.
The Woods, who gave him a hint on two games a week, showed a great game, but he had already lost 19 of his 29 games, and 7 of them were followed by each other.
Justin Rose, resting in the early morning game, returned to his friend Henry Stanson in the game with four players, and owed Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cops, the first and the third of the world.
Europe, however, did not have it in its own way, that pleasant, short day in the southwestern part of Paris.
The German champions Jordan Schfett and Justin Thomas put a chain in front of the Americans two units a week.
They won the Spanish John Ramin and Jan Potter during the four rounds of the game, and then they returned to beat Pokter and Rory McCillero with four or three pieces of paper.
It's only two times in the history of Rader Govat that the team is going back to 4 because of the lack of a unit, and it's going to play alone, even though there's no one on the Furiki side to save the cave.
After two days of being the second best, after lunch, it turns out that hell is above them.
North Korea says "no" will be completely armyed without confidence.
The president of North Korea's external affairs in the United States said on Sunday that continuing sanctions strengthen the security of the United States, and the country will never be abandoned in such circumstances.
R. Young John told the world's most annual major conference that North Korea has launched "significant charitable means" last year, such as ending internal and nuclear tests, the nuclear testing plant and the responsibility not to look at inter-military weapons and technologies.
"However, we don't see any answer from the United States."
Without the United States we can't have the promise of our nation's security, and under such circumstances we won't lose the first.
Before Ryan re-entered North Korea, known as North Korea's disaster, the approach of Washington, the "pulla" to delay, during which North Korea will be rewarded until it gradually takes its steps, his statement was important because it did not die from the delay of isolation, as it had done in the past.
In Singapore, on 12 June, Kim Young Wynn of North Korea and U.S. President Donald Tramp of the United States made a joint statement at the first summit in Singapore, where Kim promised to work on the development of the Korean tract, until Tramp promised to secure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always wanted to end the Korean war in the 1950s and 53s, but the United States has said that Phanya should first hand over his medieval weapons.
Washington has also rejected the calls for the cruel international sanctions against South Korea.
The U.S. claims that "depression is going to be the first," and it increases pressure by means of criminal means to achieve its objective accurately, and even refers to the declaration of the end of the war," said Ray.
The understanding that punishments can cause us to give birth is simply a dream to those who do not know us
But the problem is that constant punishments also deepen our insecurity.
Ryan didn't say anything about the second summit program of Kim and Tramph, which the U.S. leader emphasized earlier this week.
Instead, the chairman emphasized the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Mun Jain, over the past five months, and added, "If this was part of the extension issue of South Korea, not the United States, it wouldn't have reached this conclusion.
If that was the case, Riy's party was quite different from last year's festival when he said at the U.S. General Assembly that the U.S. mother-in-law had become inevitable after "Paron Evil President" Tramp Kim named himself "the Man of the Heart".
In the United States this year, Tramph, who had threatened to "destroy" North Korea last year, commended Kim for her courageous steps, but said that much work would still be done, and the prosecutions would continue until North Korea's collapse.
"It's not true if it lasts for two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia insist that the United Nations Security Council should take action against the steps taken in the Balkans.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompey of the United Nations Security Council said on Friday: "The use of the Security Council's means of punishment must be actively and without prejudice to the total, final, approved refusal from the military.
Since 2006, the Security Council has begun to use sanctions against North Korea to block the plans of the Pan-Painian Middle Army and the Palestinian schools.
Pompey met Ray at the United Nations High School and announced that next month he would come back to prepare for the second summit in Spain.
Pompey has left Spain three times this year, but the last visit has not been so good.
In July, he left Spain saying that he had been registered before, and that North Korea was able to accuse him of "guest requirements" within a few hours.
At this month's meeting, North Korea promised that the Kaamontaj educational center and the middle university would be able to handle "responsive means".
He told Kim that the "responsibility means" are the security assurances promised by Tramp in Singapore and are aimed at improving relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University are taking a special course on how to get enough rest.
The new course enabled her students to sleep more and more to fight the growing macho culture, which is learning all night with caffeine.
Academics have found that the number of students in one university is often lacking in knowledge of how to care for them.
This course has been organized by Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dr. Brigham and Kenachen Hospital, Charles Caisler, who is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start his course on what impact unemployment has on education.
A girl finally approached her and said, "Why do I only know about this right now, at a high school?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprises her," said the Telegraph.
This year's first lesson explains to students how good practice can affect the educational and educational situation, as well as general self-esteem.
Professor of Mental Health at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health Services at the University said that the university has decided to start the courses just to make it clear that students are not really sleeping that week.
An hour's course includes different interactive arrangements.
In a part of it, there's a chart where students are familiar with the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how sleep can not affect the educational situation, as well as the importance of sleep.
In another area, participants are showing how long-term fatigue can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
An interactive map encourages participants to think about everyday life.
"We know this can't change students' behavior."
"But we believe they have the right to know how and how you have the right to know about the consequences of using tobacco on your health," said Professor Kaiser.
According to his "All night long" proud culture, modern technology and the constant pressure on students is a growing problem.
A lot of sleep and enough sleep should be for students to cope with stress, anxiety and anxiety, even the increase in stress, because fatigue combines the rhythm of mental fatigue and they're always tired.
Raymond, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, is helping Professor Kaysler to organize the course during his first course last year, one of the courses in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged the entire university course.
Next, she expects to ask the opponents to participate in this school program before she participates in the state school.
Professor Castle advises students to draw up a graph with the help of the memory when to examine when to hurry, as well as to learn about the harmful effects of light-saving electronics and LEDs, which can also interfere with the process of testing.
Livingstone 190 Rengers Menga owes to pirates.
The Rangers were hit again because Dolly Mangan's battalion cost Steven Gerard's team a debt in Livingstone account.
After the game, Imbrox wanted to record his first victory, but the Garry Holtz team disappointed Gerard twice, leaving 8 units in the 12th game at the time of the Lidbroke Primes League.
Menga came out seven minutes before the game, and it seemed like the Ranger team would never be ready to play.
While Ranger is a sixth-horizonous, Livingstone goes from the third few-horizontal gorges to Hebron.
And then there was another problem for the Rangers, because Kallo Spence was hit by some head injuries.
The difference between eight units of iron also resulted in the exchange of iron with Bethfred.
On the other hand, Holt joined the unit that had been captured by Livingstone last week, and he liked how the opponents fell from his good preparation.
The Rangers may have been in the domain, but Livingstone used more money.
They used two minutes when Megan first left the game, which gave Scott Pittman the chance to hit Alain McGregor's back, but the defense hit the bridge.
The attack by Caga of Jacobs came to Craig Halket, but the defense of Alan Litegoun was only able to cut the bridge.
The Rangers took the game, but in the last half they had more hope than faith.
Alfredo Moreles was supposed to have been attacked by the Afghans because he had been in contact with Steven Loises, but poor Steven Tomson did not pay attention to the call of the Colombians.
In the first game, Rangers were able to perform two hits, but Imbrox's former successor, Liam Kelly, was concerned about the attacks of Lasana Colibe and Ovie Igeria.
The opening of the game in Livingstone in 34 minutes was against the rules of the game, but no one could deny that it was worth it.
The Rangers were no longer able to resist the attack of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield reacted to the fact that Deeklan Kalager gave Scott Robinson the key to ending Megan.
Gerard replaced Calibal with Ren Kent during the intermission, and then the attacker attacked Moreles, but Kilely just threw the trigger.
Livingstone continued to enjoy the audience with his game, because Litgoun and Halkit kept the ring with them.
Holty's team was able to play for their own benefit in some games, but the Maghrebs were able to move Jacobs before moving from Littleton Canyon.
Glen Middleton, who replaced the Rangers, had to have the right again because they had met Jacobs, but Tomson had failed again.
As told by Ginger Almanac
And now it's part of our Sunday morning. On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, the day was born in Germany.
Ginger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the creation of Ginger's calculator.
One of the basics of the sciences was one of the basics of pop culture, such as Coronado's calls, which are the main heroes of which are a little likely Cuban scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man, what's that?
Roger, it's Ginger's computer that helps find radioactive material like the sand.
You're listening to the presence of atoms related to the radioactivity of the atoms.
Evans, tell me, this is really working right now.
Hans Gigger died in 1945 a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the bridge that bears his name is still alive today.
The new order of cancer can teach the immune system to see foreign cells.
The new order of cancer can teach the immune system to see foreign cells and kill them.
As an integral part of the treatment, it teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells.
It's the wisdom of the method to take the immune cells from the patient and change them into lab pumas.
They'll find many types of cancer, and then they'll treat the patient with natural whites.
The test of remuneration shows promising results in patients with diabetes.
A woman who had been given a warrant that was known as the obstetrics, found that her ovarian cancer had disappeared more than 18 months later.
The method is to take the immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions so they can detect many types of cancer called HER2 and introduce them together to patients.
Professor J. Betesda of the National Institute for Cancer in the United States of Maryland said, "Our results show that this information is promising."
HER2 gene generates a number of types of cancer, including rabies, ovaries, mice, and rats, explains Professor Berzoski.
The approach to finding sick cells from the patient has also helped to cure a type of leukemia.
Kenya's West, participating in the chapter "Strengthening America" on Saturday Night Live (SNL), started a debate against Tramp.
It didn't work.
Kayy West was interviewed at the SNL studio when she began to praise the United States. President Donald Tramp announced that she would be given office in 2020.
He sang the third song that night, called "The City of the Wars." After that, he began to criticize the democracies and set up a triumphal procession.
When I talk to white people, they say, "How can you love Tramph? He's a racist."
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America before," he said.
SNL began with her son Met Denon, where Hollywood star played the witness of sexual violence of Christine Blaise Fort, before the Senate's judicial committee.
Although it has not been shown, the video of West has been posted on social networks by Horristic Chris Roki.
It's not clear whether Rock did it to get Westy or not.
West also complained to the audience that because of a certain topic, it was difficult for him to attend.
They betrayed me.
They said they didn't get out with that head.
They put it on my head.
According to Washington Examiner, I'm in Paradise.
He continued, "You want to see Paradise," saying, as if he wanted to wear his Superman's back, that would mean that no one could say what he did. "You want to bring the world forward."
"Try to love."
His comments angered the audience again. SNL members were also worried about the appearance. Variety writes that even one person said, "The whole studio is gone."
West introduced a song instead of Aryana Grande, who died a few days ago.
The West confused many by singing "I love" the song as Perrier Bottle.
Westy supported the director of the conservation team, the Towers of Canada, who wrote, "For one of the most unsatisfied souls, I thank you for the support of the group."
Correspondent Karen Hunter wrote that West was just what it was, and it's a miracle.
"But I don't want to praise anyone by buying his songs, his dress or his art when his thoughts are dangerous to my society."
"She's free."
"So do we," he added.
Before Shou, Refere said on Twitter that he changed his name and is now officially known as Kany West.
He's not the first artist who changed his name. He's following Didy, who's also known as Paf Deid, P.D. and P.D.
Snub Dogo was also named Snub Lean. And indeed, the lyrics of the song were changed by the legend Arkazin, and so on.
In the Belfast restaurant, an experiment has been made.
A 45-year-old man was arrested on Friday at a restaurant in East Belfast.
The police reported that the media had taken place in Balkhamor.
On Tuesday, the defendant will be present at the Belfast District Court.
The charge will be dismissed by the courts.
The star-distance of the film of the game of the harp is a dark man.
Kit Harinson is known for his hard-to-do role in the play of John Snou's HBO's game on violent television.
But 31-year-olds have broken the Macoher's schedule, saying that such roles make boys think they should have a good respect.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said that he doesn't think it's a thing. And he asked how to solve the problem of dark men in the #MeToo century.
Kitt, who has recently married the star of Gahar's game again with Rose Leslie for 31 years, has confirmed that it's very important to solve this problem.
"I think we've been wrong about men," he said.
"As we have taught men, so have they grown, and now we see the problem."
Kitty believes that television has to be partly responsible for teaching a lot of men's skills.
He went on, "What's in it and what's in it?"
What are they learning from television and the streets that make young men that kind of guy?
I think this is one of the main problems of our time. How we change it.
"Because it strongly affects young boys."
During the interview, he promised that when Gahar's game will be finished next summer all the series of films, he won't play any more at any time, because he's sick of battle fields and horses.
From November, I had to play Sam Shefhard's West in a film about the film about the movie director and his thief brother.
Daresan recently concluded that the first good thing in Gahar's game was to meet his wife, Leslie.
"I've met my wife in the neighborhoods of this film, and it was the beginning of my family's future, and then my life begins," she said.
In the television channel of Amy's fantasies, Rosie's daughter, John Snou's beloved daughter, was born in Igrid, Kitty's body.
Zong married in June 2018 in Scotland, the father's house of Leslie.
MIV/IAH China reports 14 percent of the cases.
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people suffering from HIV/AIDS.
More than 82,000 people have been treated on earth, health bodies.
Only 40,000 cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast, most cases have been sexually transmitted.
In some parts of China, HIV was usually spread rapidly through blood.
During the June March conference in China, there were even reports of the health of the Chinese people who were passing through that route.
But the number of people who suffer from advanced HIV/AIDS increases by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted IA has become the foundation of China's LGBT society.
In 1997 co-operation was rejected in China, but the LGBT community was considered to have been discriminated against.
Because of the Earth's conservation values, it's said 70% of men who think about men will fight women.
The basic reason for the transmission of diseases is sexual relations that are not protected.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to ensure access to the MII medicine in order to solve the problem.
Maxim Walter claims that the data from the Senators of the Grand Chamber has come true, claiming that they are dangerous stars and speculation.
Macsim Walter of the United States condemned the charges on Sunday, and one of his staff members put the personal data of three federal senators in the governor's Wikipedia.
The Democrats of Los Angeles have confirmed that the protests have been made by experts and web cassettes.
"Sudden, false and other harmful stars," said the TV in her statement.
The above information included home cell phones and cell phones, which belonged to the United States Senates of South Carolina, Lindsey Graham of West Carolina, and Mike Linne of Utah and Orine Hetty of the United States.
The interview was posted by a prominent person on the Internet on Friday at Capitol Hill at Britt Cawano's sexual abuse hearings at the Supreme Court.
It happened after the three senators examined Cavanaugh.
The surveillance sites Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the message source's IP is connected to Waters' office, and that's what the report said about the Voters' team.
Walters continued that these inconsistencies are completely wrong and utter lies.
A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been revealed as a result of these false and false accusations, has no responsibility for the statement.
These inconsistencies are completely wrong and utter lies.
Voters' statement was immediately investigated on the entire Internet.
"It's angering," wrote Flashers.
That means he doesn't want to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something wrong, he should not be angry.
He should not be opposed.
He should not doubt the motive of the defendant.
He needs to stay calm and calm.
Flescher compared the criticisms of the democracies of Voters' reaction to Kawana, who accused the defendants of being angry at the time of the hearing of three weeks.
Umar Navaron, the presidential poet of the Middle East, tried to dominate Walters and he shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Well, if it's true," he wrote with a smile.
In his statement, Walters said that his office had warned of the charges against the legal bodies and the legal bodies.
"We will be willing to expose the guilty," he continued, "they will be fully responsible for their actions that have a dangerous and destructive effect on any member of my staff.
About Johnny English Strings Again.
Now it's become a habit to look for the significance of Brexit in any new film in the British language. This seems to be acceptable to Johnny English in the event of a change of performance, which began in 2003 and has been called life again since 2011 by Johnny English.
It's funny to think about how clearly we can have a national expression.
In any case, in a subtle way, with little eyes, unfortunately, Johnny English received a second license, which means he's a characterist face for non-English societies.
She's certainly a smart secret worker, who, despite her surprises, looked like Kluzo, Mistre Bin, who was involved in the launch of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
He's also initially based on a fake traveler and an international man like Atxon, who's already playing in the forgotten Barclaycard television show, creating a chaos situation.
There's one or two beautiful moments in Johnny's English.
I loved Johnny English as I approached him in the middle of a military suit and a seat, which was surrounded by a wheelchair.
The physical character gift of the Atxon is shown, but the hero has lost his power and is considered to be an extra, because it's already an integral part of the heavy film, such as the 007 and the Invincible.
Homoor is more attractive to children than adults. And for me, Johnny English is not such an art and fictional style of Atxon.
Today, Great Britain is in serious danger.
The Kibi's opponents have come into the British media, revealing the identity of the secret staff, to replace the factory, which is a small part of Kevin Edon.
It's the last battalion for the oppressed and oppressed ruler who suffers from political ignorance. Emma Thompson does the impossible in the role of Teresa May, but there's nothing to do in the scenario.
The consultants say, because all the newspapers have been discovered, they have to bring one of the past.
This means going back to Johnny English, who is now teaching in a number of states, but at the same time teaching how to be involved.
The English has returned to Whitehall for a quick conversation and has joined his ex-wife, Buffy, who plays Ben Miller.
Buff is now married and is the commander of Suzanawa, in the joy of the hockeys, where Vicki Peredin has a little weakened.
So Batman and Robin are making serious mistakes again in the secret ministry, meeting with Olga Curlynko's beautiful wife, Ophelia Bulatova.
However, the director has broken down a set of billiard technologies who believe that they can solve the computer problems of Britain, Jack Lewis, who has played the role of wicked Jason Volta.
English and Buff are starting the course of their actions. As providers, they burn the French restaurant, they fail to sail to Voltage. English is being organized using virtual reality audiences to see what's going on in Walter's house.
Finally, all the activities are clear, but because they were fun and interesting, there's a whole child television.
It's pretty heavy.
Taking into account other English films, I always wonder if it is possible that Britain's control over Roman Atxson would give him a role that would be really fair to his gift.
The Liberians claim to design a plan, according to which the British will work for 4 days, but they will pay for 5 days instead.
Jeremy Corbin's lab has a plan, according to which British people will work 4 days, but will be paid for 5 days instead.
The Society wants companies to give their employees one more day of freedom because of the presence of artificial intelligence.
It'd be nice if the workers had a three-day break, but they'd be paid the rest of the day.
The sources say that this idea has entered the economic system, and it's planned to change the country for the benefit of workers.
The idea of a 4-day working week was established by the World Trade Congress, a good way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
The speech of the Liberian Association told Sunday Times: "The proposal will be delivered by the end of the year.
This is not a problem for a day to solve, but the 4-day working week's idea fits in to keep the economy balanced and effective military."
The Liberian Federation will not be the first to adopt such an idea, because the Canadian Federation has also promised four-day working weeks throughout the 2017 campaign.
But this idea is still not fully considered by the Liberian community.
The Liberian union speaker said that the 4-day working week is not a federal policy, and is not viewed by the union.
John McDonald organized my conference for the Liberians to introduce socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonald said he decided to force companies to reinstate the government between corrupt employers and thieves.
Steverian economies also predict that water companies will not receive their health benefits because the Liberian environment can reduce by taking into account a number of shortcomings.
He also determined that 10 percent of companies are planning to commit fraud and pass it on to the employees who are expected to pay up to 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy 60 Rope magazine, has told us that the scientific Bureau of Investigations will change its opinion on Kawano.
The investigation of the Bureau of Investigations against Judge Brit Cawano has been delayed in the Supreme Court for at least one week to finalize his appointment.
During the afternoon interview, 60 of the newspaper Rope asked General Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the scientific bureau of the expeditions could force them to change their mind.
Kenedy found more than his South Carolina employee.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd join the audience, I said I spoke to Kawano.
I called him when the charges were made, and I said, "You did."
He was determined, without doubt.
The river is still light as a fish.
"I have an opinion on Brit Cawano, and that is an inconsistencies," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Britt's making a big mistake," added Graham, addressing Christine Lesley Forron.
"And all those who sign it can't confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any new changes.
What is global urban development, and will it reduce poverty?
This week, New York will be held by Global City, the most annual musical event that is involved in a wonderful celebration of the wonderful star groups, to reduce poverty.
It's already 7 billion years ago that tens of thousands of people are gathering in the central park, not only to enjoy the achievements of Janet Jackson, Kardy Bie and Shawn Mendez, but also to vote on the original goal of action, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by the year 2030.
The Global Urban Development, launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Programme. It is an international security group aimed at increasing the number of active combatants to end poverty.
To get the free entrance to the event, if you don't want VIP toms, you have to do something, such as volunteering, sending the governing bodies to e-mails, performing telephone calls, and some other activities, aimed at eradicating poverty.
How did the Global citizen achieve its goal?
Is it a good idea to pay people a free entrance, that they just feel good about the idea that they can only send e-mails to change something?
Global citizens say 19 million operations have been undertaken for various purposes since 2011.
It is said that these activities have helped to call upon world leaders to collect more than $37 billion, which can change the lives of 2,25 billion by the year 2030.
In 2018, the group has submitted 390 calls and appeals, which has already collected some 10 billion dollars.
The group says the funds can be directed directly to 659 million people around the world.
After receiving a total of $35 million from Global City, Rwanda was promised to end the campaign.
"We can enter Ron, with the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and Global citizens, and you are also in Ron, writing in history about social injustice against corruption," said Dresden Wilman, at a meeting of his own life in London in 2018.
The group also announced that the United Kingdom has decided to finance the education programme to help provide 5 million women and children with food for mothers and children.
One of the most common questions on websites is, "What makes you believe that we can end poverty?"
Global citizen answers, "It's a long and difficult way, there's going to be gaps and failures.
Like civil rights and anti-censorship movements before us, we will also succeed because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, Vicend, Shawn Mendez, Cadery Bin, Daniel Monan are among the stars that have come to participate in New York's operation, which is hosted by Deborah L. Franz and Jug Jaxman.
In front of their actions, "The United States can use the ship to reduce Russian energy."
"Washinhoon can use the provision of Russian energy to prevent his ship, including "the Middle East," U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Züan of the Sub-U.S.A., referring to Washington Examiner.
The army added that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it is legally invited by the government, is intended to find new markets.
"I believe they are selling their energy in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the office, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States, with the help of our ship, has the opportunity to make sure that maritime traffic is open and, if necessary, can prevent them from becoming convinced that their energy will not enter the market," he said.
Zinken was against the members of the event, who were invited by Dachin of Energie Guards, a non-commercial organization that represents him as "the voice of Energies" in the United States.
He was going to compare Washington's approaches to cooperation with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic choice of Iran and Russia, less or more, is the replacement of fuel and the greatest use of fuel," he said, representing Russia as a "a powered zone" based on a brand-based economy.
According to the statement, the Trampian government was doing its mission to add European terms to the natural gas, instead of Russia, by offering European terrorists a more efficient alternative.
As a result, U.S. president Donald Trampi, U.S. government officials, tried to convince Germany that the "response" will be rejected by Northeast half of the 2-star project, which, according to Trampi, Berlin has become Moscow's "potant".
Moscow has many points out that, with a value of $11 million, the North-West 2 amphibians, built up to 110 square feet [110 sq m] of force, is a single economic project.
Kremlin argues that the strong opposition to Washington's project is just an example of economic and unfair interaction.
"I believe that we are unique in that energy cannot be a force for pressure and that terrorists should be able to select suppliers," said President Alexander Nook of Russia after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was challenged by Germany, which confirmed the stability of the project.
Germany's well-being organization, the German Federal Federation (GAF), has encouraged the United States to stay away from the energy policy of Europe and from the agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when third-party energy supply is in the middle," said Daethr Kemp, president of the German Federation (GAF) after the last meeting of Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Varren will pay serious attention to participating in the President's election in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Varen of Massachusetts said he would pay serious attention to participating in the presidential elections on the weekend after the inter-electoral elections.
In Hollywood, Massachusetts, during a meeting with the public, Varen concluded that he was thinking of being appointed.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and direct our corrupt government, and it's a leading woman," he said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will pay close attention to the president."
At a meeting with the public, Varen expressed his opinion about President Donald Tramp, saying that he "goes through this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Tramp is doing with our population," he said.
Varen was honest in his defense of Tramp and Bret Kawin, the Supreme Court of Justice.
On Wednesday, in Twitter, Varen said, "Of course we need HDB's research before it's too late."
The Friday issue, however, showed that most of Varen's own creditors think he should not be appointed in 2020.
According to a question from the Political Research Centre/Boston Globe of Sufford University, the probability of mass deaths is that the senator is not supposed to be present.
The percentage of Yeshua has been on the side of this arrangement.
The survey showed that former Professor Davel Patrich had more supporters, 38 percent had his potential position, and 48 percent against him.
Other important popular names that were included in the potential bidder's wish in 2020 include former vice president Joe Baden and Senator Berne Sanders of Vermont.
Baden said he'd officially decide to make a decision in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the postwar stress disorder of Drac Palin
Trik Palin, 26 September, has been in Iraq for a year.
On Tuesday evening, he was arrested and beaten for family violence.
"What's going on with my son, which he's going through when he comes back, I can see other families who feel the consequences of stress stress and the backs that our soldiers are returning," he said to the public at the time of the siege of Oklahoma Donald Tramph.
Palin called his arrest "in the room" and said about his friend and other veterans, "they're going back a little bit, they're getting tired, they're going back, wondering if they'll find respect for everything they've given to their military and military associates in this country."
He was arrested in Vasilia, Alaska, for two weeks, and sentenced to family violence against his wife, according to the family violence and the alcohol-induced military report, Dan Banty of the Department of Vassilia.
The 18 states, Washington, support the new security policy challenges.
Ten states and Colombia support the new U.S. government's legal challenge that refuses to provide security to those who are fleeing from criminal groups or family violence.
The representatives of 18 countries and the region recently presented themselves in Washington on Friday as a court council to support security seekers' politics, says the NBC News.
The visitor's full name is Grace W. August has not been revealed.
He told his partner "and the boys of his powerful criminal group" to hurt him, but U.S. officials refused to visit him on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawmakers of the country that supports Greece, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who provide large numbers of protesters seeking shelter in the United States, have presented themselves as people who have always had problems with criminal groups and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was opposed to the 2014 decision of the Winners' Research Council, which allowed victims of family violence to seek asylum without a document.
Chief Justice Carl Rassin said in his statement that the new policy "is in line with the law of state, state and international decades."
"The state law requires that all visitors to the security should be judged on the basis of clear facts and circumstances of the visitors, and such a prohibition does not uphold that principle," the judge briefed the court's council.
The prosecutors then discussed the question that the policy of the winners refusing to come is damaging the US economy, saying that they are potential contractors and "needed employers."
Chief Justice Jeff Secions ordered judges to leave June no more to protect the criminal groups and the victims of family violence.
"It is for those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or special social group or political opinion," said Sesion in her statement on June 11 on politics.
The facility never intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
In Palu, desperate efforts are being made to save, because death cases have been repeated on the way to find the combatants.
The situation was quite surprising for the combatants.
"It was very difficult," said 35-year-old mother, Rissa Cosmán, caring for a young man who had a high school.
"Every minute the emergency brings the bodies.
The clean water is weak."
They've seen the inhabitants return their own houses, take away their belongings, try to save everything they've found.
A few people were injured, and a 7.5-balancing hospital was filled.
Some of the patients, including Doi Harris, who had had a fever and a fever, were hospitalized at the Palacio Military Hospital, where patients were treated because of ongoing severe trials.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt when the powerful earthquake shook the room of the five-room guesthouse, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was stuck under the walls, I think, said Harris to Associated Press, adding that his family was participating in a marriage in the city.
I heard my wife calling for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. Despane accuses China of threats of propaganda.
A week later, when China's official paper published four pages of praise in the United States, praising the US-China marketing opportunities every day, the US Despane Peggin in China accused the United States of spreading the press.
U.S. President Donald Tramp made an addition to the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register of China last Thursday, with the largest sales paper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of joining the United States Congress on November 6, that China is on its way.
The allegations of the team that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. election showed what the U.S. officials said to Reuters that it was a new wave of pressure from Washington to China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a deteriorating trade war, which has led them to balance the account when they have to set up barriers to each other's content.
The anti-trafficking attacks in the earlier stages of the trade war by China were aimed at attacking the perpetrators of such countries as Aowan, which the U.S. and Chinese experts say.
In China, U.S. Despane Terry Bensted, who had been to China's former president of the AOO for Agriculture, said that China had attacked American workers, farmers and workers.
As Bensted writes in the table of the daily Des Moines Register, "in our own free currency, China is now repeating this persecution."
"When your preaching is done in Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is using the U.S. culture of freedom of speech and of language," wrote Bensted.
"On the contrary, given that the Moule is under strict control of the Communist Union of China, it is possible to meet a limited number of conflicting views in the Pakini road in the paper school, and it is impossible to see the real expression of the various views that the Chinese may have about the disturbing economic path of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous newspapers in China has been avoided" to publish his proposal, although he did not mention what the paper is about.
According to the Canary Islands, presidents are feeding women’s voters before intermediate elections, warning investigators
While very high officials remain in their position and protect Brit Kawano, a member of the Supreme Court, despite a number of allegations of sexual violence, researchers have warned that they will be affected by the previous internal elections, especially by women.
The feelings about this have been too strong, and most of the officials have officially declared they want to keep on fighting.
"It's impossible to turn such things around," said Professor Grant Riher, professor of politics at the University of Siriguz, in The Hill on Tuesday.
Riher said that he suspects that the last moment's claim on the need to conduct research by Senator Jeff Flexie (Arisona) would be sufficient to calm down the angry voters.
"They won't forget what happened last night, they won't forget it in the morning, they won't forget it in November," said Kary Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to the group on Friday.
On Wednesday morning, when the presiding officers of the Judicial Committee decided to appoint Kawanao as a member of the Supreme Court, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise for his testimony, the leaders in the Senate's polls said "november is coming," told Mic.
"Democrats' spirituality and movement will be enormous," non-profit political analyst Steve Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially for non-profit voters living abroad, as well as for 18-29-year-old voters who don't love the president, but often don't take part in the elections."
Even pre-Front's public testimony on the allegations of sexual harassment against a member of the Supreme Court, the investigators claimed that if the presidents decided to establish it, it could be an objection.
"This has become a shock to the National Assembly," said former president of the National Committee of the United Nations last week, Michael Stile, told NBC News.
"The word is not only about the committee's aggression or final aggression, but about whether Kawano will be a member of the court, but also about how the presidents have approached the question and how they have shown their attitude to him," said the media spokesman, Guy Cecil, who is head of the U.S. Priority Group, helping to select Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a little confused about who should believe in the names of Ford and Kawana.
YouGov's new question shows that 41 percent of the respondents probably believe in Ford's testimony, and 35 percent probably believe in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent think that Kawano has probably put or trusted in his instructions, and 30 percent says the same about Ford.
After the Fly's arrest, HDB is now investigating Ford and at least another prosecutor, Debora Ramiris, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under oath to the Senate's judicial committee that Kawanon was attacked at the age of 17.
Ramiris claims that he was presented with a degree in the Office of the Supreme Court to his sexual organs when he attended a seminar at the University of Ely in 1980.
The writer of the World Post plans to create new networks to interact with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lin, founder of the World Security Council, is opening up a banner that will try to interact with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source of Bernes-Ley, on Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and where that information will be available.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Bernes-Lin said Inrupt's goal is "to rule the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the prize.
"This is a historic time."
The program uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own network database.
It can contain contact lists, lists of items, journals, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal online data storage is that the user decides who can access the information.
The company calls it "increasing personal rights and opportunities by means of tweets."
According to the company's principal manager, John Bries, Inrupt, the idea is that the company will provide resources, work and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company is now part of the security offered by IBM from Bernes-Lys, from Brussels, from a number of standing planners who have agreed to work on the project, and from a group of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technologymakers around the world are able to create their integrated additions using the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lin said that she and her team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to introduce all changes in places where their business models are completely changed in one second."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release on Wednesday, Bernes-Line wrote that Inrupt's "to ensure the full quality and quality of the new network based on solid energy and ecosystem."
In 1994, Bernes-Lin replaced the Internet when he founded the Consulate of the World Serostein of Massachusetts.
In the last few months, Berners-Lin has been an influential voice in discussions on the neutrality of the network.
Even Inrupt will be the founder and leader of the World Heritage Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'll welcome this next century of the network," added Bernes-Line.
Bernard Van, who was raised in the spiritual sense during the first world war in Victoria
The only spiritualist in the Church of England who earned the Chachi of Victoria during World War I was raised in his hometown 100 years later.
General-Letenant, Father Bernad van, received this gift on September 29, 1918, when he attacked Belgium and Leicur.
But four days later, he was killed by a kidnapper, not knowing he deserved the British highest military award.
On Tuesday, in Ruschen, Northhamptonshire, two holes opened.
One of his uncles, Michael Van, said, "It's too symbolic," which will be opened 100 years from his father's gift deed.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, General-Lediant Bernader Van led his money to become "in the middle of a thick forest and into the fire of desert weapons and giants".
Then he hurried to the fireplace, and moved the tower before "Great City," and took the field, and watered the three men of the cave.
General Ladenant was killed on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his dad's actions, "I know that I'm never worthy of anything, but that's worth it."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also made fun of the way he was led by the Brentwood Imperial Juvenile.
Michael Van said "it's a great honor to form a part of the scale," and he added that "the dignity of real hero is shown in the support of many people."
MMA worshipers stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they saw Chozuk Peppa.
Imagine that you're not sleeping all night, watching Bellator 206 in the lab just because you're not allowed to watch the main event.
In San Jose were expected to be 13 minutes, including 6 principals, who were to be shown on the 5th floor in the United Kingdom.
The time of the 6th -- just when Gilead Moss and Roy MacDonald were preparing to be held, the TVs were surprised in the United Kingdom when they started showing Chozok Peppa.
It didn't bother many, because until tomorrow they had been lucky for a special moment.
One of the priests described this transition in Twitter to a child's multfilm as a "dangerous cat."
"It's a government order that at 6 a.m. it's not appropriate for such content, so they had to pass on children's communications," said Bellator, a high-ranking and communication leader, Dave Schwarz, in response to the question of passing.
"Yes, Chozok Peppa."
Bellator's president, Scott Koker, said they're preparing to work on their graphics so that United Kingdom TVs will be included in the future.
"When I think about it again, I think we can do it," said Koker.
"But there's six o'clock tomorrow morning there, we can't do it until six o'clock, which is already two weeks ago.
But we work that way.
Believe me, when the message changed, there were many messages that no one loved.
We were trying to fix the situation, thinking it was a technical trap.
But it wasn't. It was a political problem.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of minutes to 5, as usual, we're trying to give more to the worshipers, but we're failing.
This is an emergency situation."
The Desert Island Discs. Tom Daley felt "lower" because of sexual orientation
Olympian poet Tom Daily says he grew up feeling that he is lower than others because of his sexual orientation, but it has brought him closer to success.
A 24-year-old musician says that until he went to high school, he didn't realize, "Not everybody's like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 in the Desert Island Discs, which was the first time that Loureen Lowern had spoken about the rights of homosexuals to "entrust others."
He also said that after becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Yang, who has been a regular driver for two years, has stopped for a few months because of his illness.
In his first interview, Daniel said that as he grew up, he felt "lower" than others, because "love for boys and girls was unacceptable in society."
He said, "That's what makes me feel so low today that I can't feel it."
He said he wanted to prove that something was coming from him so that people wouldn't be disappointed by knowing about his sexual orientation.
The Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games has become a great protection of LGBT rights and has used its participation in the Australian Association Games this year, calling for more countries to update their membership.
He said it was expressed because his experience has led him to live an open life without consequences, and he wanted to inspire hope for others.
The World Cup champion said that in 2013, a man, a U.S. cinematographic teacher, named Lens Black, was "inquiry" for him.
The last year, Delly married an anesthesiologist, who is 20 years older than she, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
He said, "When you're so young, I'm going through something like that (that's when Olympeda was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later)," it was hard to find one of the years that had passed between the same neighborhoods.
In June, the husband became the father of a boy named Robert Rey Black-Dell, and he says that "all hope" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say that the whole goal is to raise gold medals," he said.
"You know, there are more things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robby."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daniel says his father didn't accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked for was that if they won London-2012 games, he wanted to sit first.
"I couldn't say to him, 'Father, you won't be there when you sit first.'"
"I took his hand when he stopped smoking, and since the time he stopped smoking and died, I finally realized that he wasn't useless," he said.
The following year, Dale joined the Olympic Games in 2012 and developed the bronze medal.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: running before the Olympics at home, it couldn't have been better," he said.
It also influenced the selection of its first song, which was the "Proud" by Hizer Smole, who accompanied him throughout the preparation of the Olympics, and from which it is still cleaned.
Desert Island Discs is at the BBC Radio 4 in the winter, at 11:15 BST in British time.
Michaelson, who lives in a poor neighborhood, is in the conservatory during the raid on the Ryder Valley
U.S. Phil Michelson will set up a racer on Sunday when I play his 47th game in the field of the radar, but he'll have to work on his school environment if he doesn't want it to be a bad mood.
It's 12 times going to play in a two-year cycle, but trainer Jim Fury left him at the warehouse's table on Thursday's.
Instead of being at the center of events, as it has often happened, the winner of the bridge spent half his day as a worshiper, and the other half working on his game at the school, trying to fix what he was worried about.
48-year-old music, which wasn't even the best of the first hits in his career, is not the ideal option for the weak Le Golf National field, where accidents usually punish the attackers.
And even if the field isn't going to be so scared of itself, Michelson will meet the British Open Championship, Franksco Mollinary, who's on the team to create young Tommy Fitwood Eve, winning all the games this week.
If the Americans who are 4 singles before the 12 individual games start well, the game of Michelson can be decisive.
Fury's willing to tell her sons, not that she had more to say than that.
"She fully understood her role today, she cut her hand, touched me, and said she would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"She has great confidence in her powers.
He's included in the House of Commons, and he's given so much to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't predict he'd play two games.
I was predicting more, but it did, and this, I think, is the way we had to choose.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Michelson will defeat the leader of the most popular games in the city of Nick Faldo, in the Ryder Valley.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Valley, which never actually meets the heights of his individual indicators.
Michaelson has 18 winnings, 20 debts and 7 non-members, even though Fürich says his presence is adding something extraordinary to the team.
"She's funny, she's funny, she's smart, she likes to play tricks on people's heads, and she's a great team," he explained.
"I guess young players also had fun this week playing against him, and it was fun to follow it.
He's giving more than he's playing."
The great majority of Europeans know that the great majority will soon be gone
The European Highness Thomas Born knows from his experience that the advantage that he felt before the final games of the radar can easily turn into an inconsistencies.
Daniel's first game was held in Valderam in 1997, where the team headed by the South Balstery had a 5-dollar advantage over the Americans, but the final score was 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Valderama, where we fought, and in Valderama, where we won, but not more," said Born, after seeing how the 2018 team won on Thursday and night, 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everybody on this team that it's not the end yet.
In the morning you're going to show your best.
Let's go and do the right thing.
Nothing's done while you still have a list of units.
We have a goal: to try to build this circle, and we're focusing on it.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we also know who are on the other side of the world's best players.
And wondering how his players showed them in the golf course, he added, "I've never been superior in this job.
It's a lot of al-Mutton tomorrow.
It's a personal talk, and it's a lot of other things.
It's nice to be with a friend when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're going through the whole experience as a golfer.
This is the order you have to get players to do the best tomorrow.
Now therefore let your friend come into your house, and you shall do to him as he has done to you first."
In contrast to Bernie, his partner, Jim Furich, expects his players to be better acquainted with each other than they've met as a couple, except for Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who made 4 out of 3 units.
Fury himself was on the two sides of the final day of these rounds: he was a member of the Brooklyn victorious team, and was in the position of the winner when Europe was left with the "Midina's miracle."
"I remember every damn word it says," he answered about how Ben Crenson gathered his players in August 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important games first, but you'd like us to go right ahead, as it happened in Brooklyn and in Midian.
When that motivation starts to work in some way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We choose our team accordingly, and we command the boys to work miracles in the morning."
Tomas has been assigned to try to lead the fight, he's going to meet Rory McCillroy, and the other Europeans first half are Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raham Tomy Fletwood and Jan Potter.
"I've chosen boys this way, because I think this is the right thing to do from the beginning to the end," said Born about the players she chose.
A new German military operation was resumed
The new Freegat of the German Armed Forces had to be launched in 2014 to replace the wartime wars of the War of the Sahara, but at least by the end of the year, it will not happen because of corrupt systems and rising costs, local media have been announced.
The operation of the main fleet of the new Baden-Wuertemberg fleet in Rhineland-Pfalz has been delayed until the first half of 2019, the words of the military spokesman Die Zeit paper.
The name has to be the Red Cross in 2014, but the concerns that have arisen after the delivery have prevented the implementation of the upcoming project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuertemberg class, which were still ordered by the Razmécomese forces in 2007, are going to be replaced by the former Bremen class.
It's supposed to be combined with a powerful wave, a series of aerospaces and spaceships, as well as some secret technologies, such as reduced radios, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer waiting hours, and new frigates must be allowed to stay away from seafarers for up to two years.
But continuous delays mean that the supersede wars, which say, will allow Germany to expand its influence abroad, will be long gone when they are assigned to work, says Die Zeit.
The F125 Fregats were released in the media's headlines last year when the German forces refused to make the ship and returned it to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipping company.
This was the first time the ship was delivered to the Rzméco forces it returned to the ship's company.
There's little known about the causes of the return, but the German currency points to a number of unprecedented "programme and technical weaknesses", which would make the war effort useless if they were sent to combat.
It was especially important for programme failures, because the Baden-Wuerttemberg system ships are expected by a crew composed of 120 ships, which consists of half of the Fregats of the old Bremen class.
In addition, it became clear that the ship is extremely difficult, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the chances of subsequent improvements.
It's said that for 7000 tons, Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as difficult as the same order ships that Germany used during World War II.
In addition to non-smokers, the whole value of the project, including the preparation of the entity, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached €2.2 billion in advance, which is worth €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion):
The problem with the new frigates is also becoming more important in the light of the latest warnings about the slowdown in the German military force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Pitter Bartels, president of the Security Committee of Germany's Council, said that the Raspberry powers are actually "sporting ships that can be placed."
The officer said that the problem has grown over time, because old ships have been removed from work, but they have not been replaced.
He complained that no one in Baden-Werttemberg's class was able to collect Rsmoke's powers.
National Trust hides the children's secret life
A new research carried out in a village in the mountains of Scotland aims to explain how babies are using Landshaft as food.
There is hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of single flying insects and will help to preserve them in the future.
The research carried out by scientists from Scotland's National Trust will follow the usual and beautiful little girls, as well as the youngest generation and daughter of Dobenton in the Inverwe Gardens in Wester-Ross.
Special recorders will be installed around Kalate, which will follow the activity of babies throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out active investigations using manual detectors.
The experimental analysis of all the recordings will reveal the frequency of the sounds of babies, and will determine what types are doing.
Then there will be a map and a description of the natural environment to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
In the context of NTS conservation, Robert Durar hopes that the results will reveal that natural environments are more important to children, and how they are used in every kind of way.
This information will help clarify the advantages of environmental governance, such as the creation of professors, and will help to clarify how best to preserve forests for infants and other vulnerable species.
The number of children living in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has decreased dramatically over the past century.
They're under threat because of construction and development work that affects the natural environment of babies.
Side towers and lighting can also be dangerous, as well as the chemical training of paper and materials for roads, and the attacks by house cassettes.
The girls aren't really blind.
But their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They're using a complex sound-recording technique to find the media and prevent their flight.
The NTSC, responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings throughout the country, 38 important plants and 76,000 hectares of land, is very hard on children.
It has 10 trained researchers who regularly do research, examine the habitats, and sometimes perform rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only ban on girls in Scotland in the Thrive in Dampis-End-Galway, where 8 of the 10 girls in Scotland live.
David Thompson, governor of Calvatoum, says that the calf is an ideal place for them.
"Here, in Treve, we have a huge area for girls," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, all in good place.
But there is not much known about the girls, so the work that we do here and in other situations will help us to understand better what we need to do for them."
He stressed that it was important to check whether the girls were not and to do new conservation work within the camp, because the accidental destruction of one community could kill up to 400 children and young girls, so it is possible to destroy the entire population.
The girls are protected, and killing them, torture them, arresting them, or breaking their bones is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferel of the Scotland Children's Conservation Foundation urged the population to gather to help them.
He said, "We still have much to learn about girls, and we still don't know how they live."
Ronaldo’s allegations of violence are based on the facts and are prepared to judge the German newspaper
Christian Ronaldon described the charges of violence against him as a "false message," saying that people want to use his name to praise them.
His arguments are prepared to condemn the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has published the charges.
An American woman, Catherine Mayorga, accused of being attacked by an attacker from Portugal and Yuventus in 2009 by a woman named Las Vegas.
It was found that he then paid him $375,000 to keep quiet about that case, on Friday, Der Spiegel announced.
A few hours after the charges were heard, while the newspaper was talking to 142 million followers in the video, Ronaldon, 33 called the statements "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no:
They're lying news today," said the winner of the five-year-old Aske Gandak.
"They want to praise themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be known by saying my name, but it's part of the work.
I am a happy man, and everything is very good," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's evidence is prepared to judge Der Spiegel on the charges they call "personally unacceptable statements."
Factist Christy Sherser said that the player is demanding "the severity of the crime for psychological damage, which is probably one of the most serious cases of breaking personal rights in recent years."
It's said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in Las Vegas in the Palms Hotel.
According to the papers presented at the Clark district court in Nevada, after a meeting at the night camp, Ronald and Maorgan went to the player's room where he was probably raped.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldon, after the case, broke his legs and told him that he was '99 percent' " he's a white man's" who made a mistake because of a "one percent'.
Evidence shows that Ronald agreed that there were sexual relations in the couple, but that was a change.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her back in the hospital, but then she agreed without a trial solution because she "is afraid of revenge" and didn't want to "kill society."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to ignore that solution now, because she still wears the consequences of this supposed incident.
When he was accused, Ronaldo Mena had joined Real Madrid from Manchester University, and this summer he was transferred to the Italian capital Yuventus, with a total of €100 million.
Brixite: England, "I'm going to die" to lose the car manufacturers.
England will always be there for him if he loses his fortune as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was "anxious" when Tootan, England, told BBC that if Angela left Europe without business, it would temporarily slow down its production at the Brabanston plant near Derby.
"We need a business," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that without the business's Brexit, border cuts can cause the loss of jobs.
Auris and Avenis of Toyota produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which have been issued in other European countries.
"My view is that if England comes out of Europe at the end of March, we will start production in our factory," said Marvin Kutke, head of the company of Toota, Brunsten.
Other companies in England have expressed concern about how the Euro-Mediterranean trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will work.
BMW, for example, says that within a month after Brexit, he will close his Mini production in Oxford.
According to automakers, their main concern is without business risks of supply chaining in Brussels.
The production of Toota is based on the "right time" principle, where the parts of cars are obtained by order from the suppliers of England and Germany every 37 minutes.
If, on March 29, England will leave Europe without business, there will be a barrier that, according to the producers, can lead to cuts and bruises in parts.
Tootha would be unable to wait for her company for more than one day, said the company, and thus the production would be cancelled.
Mr. Clarke said that the Chequers programme of future relations with Teresa Maye's Eurasia "will be clearly determined to keep the limits of the war."
"We need a business: we want to have the best business that will allow us, as I say, not only to have the success of the world, but to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in a BBC Radio 4 project today.
"Not only Toota, but also other car manufacturers show that we really need to keep up with high-performance supply chains."
Tootan was unable to tell how long the production would be delayed, but he warned that the increased costs in the long term would reduce the demand for the product and finally end up at work.
Peter Chuwalaris, who worked for 24 years in Branasty and who is responsible for mass production, said his members are very worried. "My experience is that if such jobs go away, they won't come back again."
The government speaker said, "We have developed a clear and reliable agenda for our future relations with Europe."
The meeting between Tramp and Rozenstein can be delayed, says the White House.
The important meeting of Donald Tramp and the local judge, Rod Rozenstein, can be delayed one week later, because the battle against the Supreme Court, Bret Kawinha, continued, said the White House tomorrow.
Rozenstein follows the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who monitors Russia's elections by means of mediation, the links between Trump and Russia and the possible infringements of justice by the president.
The question of whether Tramp will be removed from the headquarters of the chief judge, and therefore the independence of Muller, has been the subject of spreading rumors in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rozenstein spoke to Tramph about the possibility of sending messages and removing the president directly from 25th.
Rozenstein has made the announcement.
But last two weeks, he went to the White House for a statement on his refusal.
Instead, on Friday, he met Tramph, who was then in the United Nations Organization in New York.
Tramp said he's planning not to leave Rozenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid encountering a court council that was investigating the testimony of one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Christine Blaise Ford.
On Wednesday, Tramph ordered HDB one week's investigation of Kawinah's charges, after which the whole Senate was exonerated.
Sarah Sanders, a member of the tramp mob, gave a talk on Fox News Sunday.
When they asked him about a meeting in Rosenstein, he said, "The date of the meeting is not yet scheduled, it may be this week, and I think it will be repeated for another week, taking into account all that's happening in the Supreme Court.
But, as we shall see, I always love to know how to calm down, and how to calm down."
Some reporters don't agree with that statement.
Correspondent Chris Vallans asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of asulis was not due to opposition to the "visual behaviour" of TV writers, but he said, "I don't know what it is."
And then he said that the direct link between Tramp and Mamul would be between Tramph and Mamul.
"The caller participates in more questions and answers than other presidents have done before him," he said, without any evidence. We've been looking for these numbers.
The Asullis will continue, said Sanders, but "If the mob had the opportunity to ask the U.S. president straight questions, it would be better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot, and you've seen that we've been doing it over the past few weeks, and it's going to be done again in the morning, where you can talk to the president of the United States."
The team regularly answers questions when it comes out of the White House or attends public meetings or senior officials.
A single mussel's aulism is rarely happening.
This week, in New York City, the president showed him why he's prepared and sometimes admiring reporters.
The health president writes to the members of the European Union, NHS Scotland, about the concerns of Brazil.
The health president of NHS Scotland wrote to European workers to express their gratitude for the country and their desire to remain in Brazil.
MSP Jane Freeman sent a letter that he would leave in six months after coming out of England.
The government of Scotland has already been willing to accept the costs of the state of the state of the citizens of Europe who have worked in its public service.
In his letter, Miss Freyman wrote: "During the Americas, the wars of England and Europe have continued, undermining the decisions that are expected of this tribe.
But the government of England has also promoted its readiness, without the possibility of a business difference.
I know this will be a very unpleasant time for all of you.
That's why I want to remind myself again and again how important I am to the membership of every member of the company from any nation.
Business companies and other areas bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care, and benefit our patients and the public.
Scotland is almost your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christina Abercomb has an operation immediately after head injury.
The Tegers' protection of the state of Tennessee, Christia Abrocomb has been rushed to surgery on a weekly basis after the loss of Vanderbilt Comodor 31-27, reported the head injury of Tensen's Michael Organ.
The principal teacher of the state of Tennessee, Rod Ride, told reporters that the damage was done shortly after the end.
"She's gone through the street corner of the gym, and it looks like she's been there," said Reed.
The teachers and the medical team gave Abakomb a bottle on the side line until he was transferred to the hospital and then sent a present.
The state of Tennessee official Neswell told Chris Harris at the WSMV that Abercomb is operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type of damage/level of damage" and the state of Tennessee is trying to reveal when the damage was received.
Abercomb, who has been a second player for two years, is performing his first summer in the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five power units before he left the game on Sunday, which added 18 power units to this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the ticket when they buy things in England.
Foreign buyers in England will pay more for the ticket with the additional money that is planned to help the homeless, according to a new plan of Tori.
This step will undermine the success of the desire to attract young Korean players.
There's going to be an increase in income for those who don't have to pay in England.
The Ministry of Finance predicts an increase of £120 million per year to help households.
Foreign buyers in England will pay more for the ticket with the extra money planned to help the homeless today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to prevent the success of the desire to attract young Korean players, to ensure more accessible housing and to ensure that high incomes are respected.
The increase in unemployment will be for individuals and organizations who do not have to pay in England that will protect the supplementary government against the problem of homeless people.
The increase in the price of the present indicator, including the two years in advance, in order to pay for the second house and for the rent, can be equal to three percent.
The prime minister assumes that this step will take £120 million a year.
13 percent of newly built properties in London have been purchased by non-English citizens who raise prices and make it difficult for the first time to get the housing.
Many of the world's rich areas, especially in the capital, have become "citizens", due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the city.
A week after the tax cut has been imposed by the Allies Johnson, a new policy will be implemented, which will allow more young people to buy their first residence.
He accused large construction companies of spreading land but not using them to keep buildings high and convince Miss Mayi that their buildings would become available to help solve the problem of living in England's home.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of pleasant changes in the house, including the control of the situation and the end of the "crimes" of the court.
He also wants to give the local self-government bodies great powers to build new houses.
Miss Maye said, "I told you last year that my work would help restore the English dream that life would be better for any new generation.
And that means turning our house into a broken market.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be true that it's as easy for non-English-based organizations to buy home as it is for people in England who work hard.
For many are those who dream of a house, and their hope is in vain; and their expectation is that they shall live in them.
Jack Ross, my main goal is the government of Scotland.
Sanderland's leader, Jack Ross, says his main purpose is to become the ruling ruler of Scotland in a plane.
Scott (42) enjoys the restoration challenges of the North-East group, which now takes place in the third place in League One, staying with the first three units.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, calling the last season St. Mirren as the president of Scotland.
"I wanted to play for my country, as a player for myself.
I got chapter B and that's it," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
But I grew up seeing my father when I was a kid in Scotland, and that was something that always kept me with him.
That's only possible if I was a successful team leader.
As directors of the Sanderland, the presidents of Russia include Dick Advocat, David Moise, Sam Alrodos, Martin O'Neill, Roy China and Paulo de Canyon.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel any concern about following such a large group of people who have previously rejected the proposals of Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of this moment will be measured to me by whether I can get the team back to Premier League."
Because of the construction and opportunities of this group, it certainly belongs to the Premier League.
"It's not easy to do this, but I'll probably see my success only if I can get back to the camp there."
Rose's only three years in her manager's career, from the deputy governor's district of Dumbarton, and from the Hearts leadership team for 15 months.
And then he helped Alla recover after the third step, and he changed St. Mirren from the bottom to the next season called the first winner.
And Ross says he feels better now than ever in Clyde, Hartpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real choice," he said about taking responsibility for Allao.
I sincerely believe that the government was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was playing well, and living a good life, and enjoying some of the important things.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to go through during the week.
I'm still going through all of this with stress and pressure, but the government is freer.
I've always wanted to rule, and now I'm doing it, I feel much better than what I've done all my adult life.
You can hear the full interview on Sports Sound on Saturday, September 30, on Radio Scotland, 12:00-13:00 (BST):
According to research, it's a great time to drink at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday night.
Today's gambling is a source of income for English combatants, but it's also increasing pressure on restaurants.
According to the indicators, good groups have 2.7% sales to Julius, but the restaurant income is 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business company that revealed the data, said that the ongoing state of shock and long-term participation in the world's lead in England was also forced by Julius to follow the example of June's last month, when good income increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that were more ill.
In June, the loss of 1.8 percent of restaurants was worse than Julis.
The hunger has forced the good and the poor to work more well than has reduced the work of restaurants.
Sund has also reduced the work of peppers in the summer, however, not as bad as the work of restaurants.
Looks like people just come out to drink.
Peaches and drinks have increased by 6.6 percent over a month, and food has decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman said from the RSM review of entertainment and hospitality, and these results continue to be the thought we've seen since April.
The impact of social events and sports events continues to be the biggest factor when it comes to out-of-the-house sales.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to fight, even though the decline in sales prices of 4.8 percent will have a particularly significant impact on the current highest cost.
The earth’s dry season could not have been worse for food producers, and would it have been easier for the temperature to be in August, to a degree of security.
The overall increase in the sale of peppers and restaurants, including new ones, has been 2.7% in July, affecting the reduction of brand revenues.
Coffer Peach Tracker has collected and examined the results of 47 working groups that have had a total of £9 income, and a limited list of stores.
One out of five children has a secret social media account that he's hiding from his parents.
According to the study, one out of five children aged 11 has a secret social media account that he conceals from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the "false Insta" page.
That news has been fueled by the fear of spreading sexual information
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "primary" account to show their parents.
One of the five children of 11 years of age creates social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of the "false Insta" page, leading to the Instagram website of the distribution of images.
That news has strengthened the fear of spreading sexual information.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" account to show their parents at the same time as they have personal accounts.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old girl's secret site revealed a young man who convinced others to "get her."
A survey conducted by the HMC of the Digital Awareness UK and the Heads of Schools has revealed that 40 percent of 11-18 years olds have two accounts, half of which assumes that they have a personal account.
HMC leader Mike Buchenen said, "It's disturbing that so many young people are trying to create online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ellie Doyle will be the voice of athletes in Scotland's athletics.
Ellie Doyle was selected as a non-functional director at the Scotland Athletics, at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most respected athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Bide said that this is a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
"Elyn has great respect for Scotland, England and the world's athletes, and we are confident that giving him advice will bring great benefits in Scotland," Bide said.
Doyle said, "I'm going to do it with great love, and I hope I'm really in the mood and I'm going to help control sports in Scotland."
The United States has won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and it has a total of four Olympic Olympics, and now the BBC's permanent interpreter, has lost the ability to walk after a previous chemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was undercover this day.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show you how much I'm going to get.
It was a temporary job, but I was completely healthy, I learned how to walk again, and now I'm doing driving skills.
Thank you for the messages.
The praise of fire pumps that compares mothers to dogs is spreading online views.
The fire pump organization is thinking of spreading online with a praise that compares to dogs that feed their mothers.
Elvie left a quick-to-use music video that shows how free the new moms are.
Four real mothers are sitting in the shade of a dog's bed with a song like that, "Yes, I will drink, but you don't see any noise," and "If you don't see them, they're not mine."
The trumpet continues, saying, "Take them out of my mouth, and out of my mouth they hear; and there I hear, and there is but a word about them: the little one is coming, and the small one is walking about; and the small one is bearing them, and the great one is bearing them.
However, the promotion on the Facebook page of the company has been a source of controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 pieces and hundreds of comments, video viewers have received a variety of responses, many of which say it laughs at the horrors of the mining industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use the goat for the sake of this life.
And they shall be as we are, that they may be born in the flesh, and that they may be born in the likeness of men, and that they may not be taken in by the hand of their children after them."
Elvie's pump is unknown in Elvie/Mother.
And one of them explained, "It's obviously a tragedy for a mother and a child."
But yes, why didn't you use the fire bomb to encourage those mothers who get it to keep their children.
And another added, "What kind of reality is it?"
Others have protected the praise, a woman has admitted that the song is "very funny."
I think that's a great idea.
I'd go to one if I was still eating it.
The pump made me feel like you.
Goosed is a little smart, but I accepted it as it was presented for.
"This is a wonderful life," someone wrote.
And another said, "It's a fun celebration that refreshes mothers who sleep (often in their workplace or in their society) and feel like they're "we."
It is not a glory that commends or condemns the work of an ensample.
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all involved in hiding pumps.
The idea of preaching is based on the idea that many women who wash their clothes feel the way they do.
Elvie pump, however, is almost alone, has no stomach or stomach, and is placed in the food chain, which gives a woman the opportunity to move freely, touch the child, and even get out of the house as she dies.
Anna Balarin, a mother's ECD and a colleague, explained: "Elvie pump is such a waste that it was worth working and putting on.
We wanted to focus our attention on the melting of fires and all the obstacles between women and goats, showing the unflagging feeling of freedom given by the pump in a funny and relative way.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump has been shown in the focus.
During the week of London's refurbishment, two mothers showed up at Martha Jacobsky's pool using their bodies.
Hundreds of children of the winners moved slowly to the tent camp along the Tekhas line.
Although the monthly levels of the border have remained relatively similar, the number of children who have been exposed has increased rapidly, which is partly due to the serious policy presented by the Trampi's staff has made it difficult to raise the issue of child custody.
Usually, many guards themselves were undocumented winners, and they were afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country because they wanted to have a child.
RISK grew up in June when the government bodies announced that likely overseers and the elderly members of the house would have to present their case and that these data would be transmitted to the authorities involved in the issue of the winners.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the leader of the fighting and mass services, Congress announced that the service had arrested dozens of people who were trying to take care of only the little ones.
Then the service confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no previous trial.
"As many as 80 percent of people who are overseers or family members of overseers are illegal in the country, and some of them are foreign criminals.
So we keep looking for these people," said Mr. Albens.
In order to investigate children more quickly, officials introduced a new law that might require them to come to court, 60 days in a month after they were revealed, which was the former standard.
Many will come to the video conference by telephone, instead of personally presenting themselves, to ask the judge to excuse their actions.
Those who don't meet their demands will be placed in a fast-track.
According to the report by the security staff and the last months, the longer those children remain in prison, the more likely they will be to become a flood or focus on depression, which can lead to porn and refugee experiences.
The fact that this concern is greater in large areas, such as Tornillion, where it's easier to see the suffering of children because of the size of the area.
They added that moving children to a safe city without their spiritual preparation or giving them the opportunity to make friends can put them under the burden that many are already suffering.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey to bring the "occupational forces" with them.
Following the U.S. headquarters, President Valid Al Mualem of the International Union called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Mualem, also president, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian territory, in order to fight terrorism, and, "You must show them the right attitude."
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Mualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "This holy battle until all the regions of Syria are cleansed," and that it would be said, "From the presence of foreign foreigners."
The United States has about 2000 military servants in Syria, who primarily teach or advise religious forces and the Arabs of Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 military servants in the war situation.
Speaking about refugees, Mualam said that the conditions for their return were good and accused them of "smart Western countries" of "distributive fears," which motivates refugees to stay away.
"We have called upon the international community and human organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're political about what needs to be more than a personal question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Azad and his opposing forces to put an end to the war.
U.S. experts say the last agreement between Russia and Turkey, the last one of the rebels, in Idlibi, has made it possible to create political wars.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has prevented a widespread attack on a country where 3 million people live.
But Mualam stressed that the agreement "has clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military operations would lead the Jihadists, including the "Al-Qaida" in New York City, who will be "cut off".
Stefan de Mister, the U.S. president of the United States, hopes to invite the first seat of a new committee made up of government and opposition representatives, to develop a framework for military Syria on the way to elections.
Mualem presented the conditions for participating in the Committee's meetings, stating that the task should be limited to "reviewing the current restrictions" and warned against the interference.
Why the Triumph Wins the Second Hour
In that sense, Mr. Tramp will be elected in 2020, if there is likely to be a lot of hopes of liberal TVteletons, non-smokers and fans that will not be able to pass on his leadership in the future.
This will certainly be the most dangerous end of greed.
At this point, there's no tension in the television sector.
From 2014 onwards, farm-time practices have increased more than twice in CNN by 1.05 million, and they have been in MSNBC by 1.6 million.
Fox New has an average of 2.4 million praim-time viewers, which exceeds 1.7 million in the previous four years, says Nilesen, and the MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is leading 3.5 million viewers with key advertising windows.

There's a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, in contrast to what is on television, TV shows from Washington can determine the future of Roun v. Wayne, whether families of migrants can join the world's economy, regardless of their health.
Disturbing is a trick that can only allow the most attractive TV viewers.
And yet, it comes out of the borders of being a reported citizen, when you continue to watch a group of experts discuss how to use "unexpected" sources for "recorded for writing" by Bob Woodworth, $15,000 worth of Paul Manafort, as Washington Post said, and Stormian Daniels, Tramph, wisdom, anatomia's inappropriate description.

It's not surprising that there's a great deal of financial resources being seen at the 17th election in Pennsylvania, which is the result of the reorganization of the elections, and I'm fighting two members of the present Parliament for a single election.
In the recent elections in Pittsburgh, the current member of the Palestinian Parliament, Conor Lemb, has been elected in the elections that took place in the previous elections.
Lembe is joining another Congressman, general Keith Rotfos, who is presenting the original 12th election in Pennsylvania, which is essentially corresponding to today's 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old elections had been established for the benefit of the general authorities in an unlimited manner.
In the newly formed 17th election, the dispute between the DCCC and the NRCC has been brought between the DRCC National Committee of the Democratic Advertisement Committee.
Lembe became known as Pennsylvania after he won no more in the 18th election in Pennsylvania.
For ten years, the station had been occupied by the presidents, and President Donald Tramph won 20 units in this election.
Political experts give the Democrats no advantage.
The U.S. made it difficult for China to punish Salvador, then stopped
The researchers said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met Pakin in a little pressure from Washington.
Paron Tramp met with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he had a guest in Panama until his colleagues joined the Trump Organization's management team.
The officials of the state department decided to call with the leaders of the American scientific missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the latest decisions about Taiwan's lack of knowledge this month, and said in the opening statement, Mr. Hizer Noort, the President of the United States.
But the sanctions were directed only against Salvador, which had received approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The prosecutions, which included financial aid cuts and tax cuts, would be painful for the Central American country, its high level of corruption and crime.
During the first few meetings, North American and Central American officials followed a high-level conference dedicated to security and economic development and followed a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving the United States.
But until mid-September, the top officials of the board realized that they wanted the convention to continue, actually end up with the idea of punishing Salvador.
Now it is expected that deputy mayor Michael Pens will have a conference in mid-October, which will give the importance of this meeting by the signatories, the delegates said.
Three U.S. diagnostic representatives returned safely to Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without new wave or means of punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's speech was refused to explain the details of the discussion that were described by three U.S. officials, including two experts who agreed to speak on the inner conversation, provided that their name would not be published.
Their values were established by a researcher who also said that he would not reveal his name.

The next step could be a special prosecutor, Robert Muller's report on the ban on justice by Trump, which is a very sensitive evidence in public documents.
It's said that Mr. Muller is doing his research on whether Tramp's pre-election campaign was in secret with Russia when we finally attacked our elections.
If the government changes in Congress, Mr. Tramp will be called responsible for this construction, just as he is preparing to meet with the voters again, and possibly with the same social status as his rivals.
I mean, there are a number of 'if's, and I don't think it's inevitable that Mr. Tramp or his colleagues in Europe are missing.
We all have choices on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean that will depend on how long the fight will last.

There's a turning point for history, and the development of the terrible events of humanity is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now living those rounds.
What do we do if Paron Tramp is going to get rid of the chief judge, Rod Rosenstein, a man who is in charge of the Paron Muller's investigation.
Rozenstein has been in a state of unconsciousness since this paper revealed that last year he proposed a secret vote to the president and questioned whether his office was in conformity.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times was wrong.
"How can we do if the research of the newly asked HDB (F.B.I.) of Brad Kevin is not complete or fair, or if he is established by the Supreme Court in spite of sexual violence and false testimony.

Ranger Graham Daress was happy to meet Rapid Vienna.
Rengers has invited Rapid Vienna on Friday, knowing that the victory over Austria, which followed the impressive results of Spain and Villarreal this month, will be at their high places to be identified as the Group G League in Europe.
In conclusion, because of the injury of his parents, he was unable to participate in his first move to Villarreal's 2-2, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a step forward to do more.
"It was a good time for us, because Villarreal is good," said a 31-year-old.
"We started the game, believing that we would reach something and get there.
Maybe we could take it at the end, in general, the outcome of no one was probably right.
They probably played better in the first ball, and we played better in the second ball.
Friday is another important European evening.
We hope we can get three units, but it'll be hard to play because they've had a good score in the past, but because of the group that we've been following, I'm sure we can move forward and have positive results.

Despite the fact that the researchers had a clear picture of how they wanted to care for them, few of them were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of the people of the nationwide research said they were talking to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said she's talking to her children about it.
"People want their family members to take care of, but they don't take steps to talk like this," said Holly Snaider, the founder of the Nationalwide life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them about your wishes.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss when and where you want to take care, because these choices can be a major factor in buying.
And your financial adviser can also help you find the means to pay those expenses.
The sources of your financial support can include the traditional long-term insurance policy, the hybrid-value life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or self-sustainment with your own assets as long as you have money.
Get your legal papers.
Get a healthy person you trust so that you can have a reliable person who will care for your health care and make sure that the expert meets your needs if you can't communicate.
Also, remember the importance of evidence for your finances.
You will choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your payments will be made if you are unemployed.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami, which struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Wednesday, and is still expected to increase the deaths.
Because of the lack of communication, assistive experts have not been able to obtain any information from the Dongalla area, which is located in the northern part of Palu, which was the nearest of the 7.5-Balalan crash epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were killed after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about the island of Sulawesi in Palu and Dongalla.
Palun is the capital of the Central Sulawesi state of Palau, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when they arrived at the earthquake and tsunami.
Donegal is over 300 km (180 km) long on the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The area, which is the administrative area, has a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy and agriculture are the main sources of the central Sulawesi region's economy, especially the coastal region for Donegal.
Nickel's experience is also very important for the area, but it's mainly focused on Morozali, in contrast to Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Allets, the war industry data, Palon and Dongala have suffered several times since the fall of the tsunami in the last century.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and hundreds of thousands were injured in Donegalia.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Donegal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific coast, where earthquakes occur periodically.
Here's the significant earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: The main earthquake in the region of Aceh, Indonesia, took place on 26 December in northern Sumatra, affecting 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The wave of mighty earthquakes swept the area of the western coast of Sumatra to the end of March and early April.
A few people died on the island of Naas, not far from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 The earthquake struck the northern part of Java, the most powerful island in Indonesia, which caused tsunamis to rise in the south, killing about 700 people.
2009: 7.6 balalan earthquake struck the capital city of the capital of the Western Sumatran city of Padang.
More than 1100 people died.
The earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, which led to the formation of about 10 feet [10 m] of tsunami, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Vernetian earthquake struck the area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, which reminded people of the 2004 death and final earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, the tsunami didn't strike, but over 100 people died from falling buildings.
2018: High earthquakes struck the island of Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake ended hundreds of buildings and put down thousands of workers' temporary shelters.
Sarah Pailin's eldest son was arrested on charges of family violence.
Three Peelin, the former governor of Alaska and the eldest son of the vice president Sara Peelin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Paelin, 29 years old in the city of Wasila, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of interfering with domestic violence, and protesting during the arrest, is mentioned in a report published on the weekly day of Alaska's police.
According to a police report, when one of her acquaintances tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, she took the phone.
Peelin is in Man-Su's unit of pre-trial detention, and is held in $500, KTUU.
On the Sabbath day, he stood before the church, where he was asked to receive the light, declaring that he was certainly not guilty.
Peelin threatens three A classes, which means she can be arrested for one year and spent $250,000.
He's also accused of fraud in Class Two, which is punished one day by prison and $2,000.
This isn't the first time that there's a criminal charge on Peelin.
In December 2017 he accused his father of violence against Tod Pellin.
His mother, Sarah Peelin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The work is now under review at the Alaska Court of the Veterans.
In January 2016 he was accused of family violence, family violence, and the use of arms in an emergency.
His friend claims he's hit his face.
In 2016, Veterans were severely criticized by Sarah Peelin after she linked the boy's violence to the post-traumatic stress disorder, which was the official result in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia — hundreds of victims
On Wednesday, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the earthquake on the island of Solavis.
7.5 And the earthquake took away the foundations of the earth, and finished them into a thousand houses.
The networks of electricity and communication have been reduced, and the number of victims is likely to increase in the days ahead.
The earthquake was recorded not far from the center of the Soviet Union, the capital city of Jakarta, in the north-east of Indonesia.
The time of the attack is seen in videos on social networks.
And there were many people gathered in the city of Palu to join in the crater when the storm blew the rock.
The U.S. prosecutors demand that New York's terrorist attack be put to death by a suspect, which is rare.
In New York, court judges demand execution on Saifulo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack that took 8 people's lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been applied in the country since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipou is supposed to have been attacked by a freighter from Home Depot on the road to the Maternal Side of Manhattan.
In order to justify the death penalty, judges will have to prove that Saipo has killed 8 victims and that he has suffered serious physical damage, says the New York Southern Court of Justice.
According to the case-law paper, the death penalty is possible in two articles.
Weeks after the release, the sworn solicitors filed a complaint against Saipov, making it 22 charges, including 8 charges of murder for money laundering, which are usually used by prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of cars.
The release required "sustaining planning and transparency," said judges, "the way in which the work was carried out by the Saipou was built as a "good, cruel and immoral" act.
"Shifullo Heibulivist Saipo has damaged and lost Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Loor Dekedt, Daren Dreiki, Ariel Erliji, Erna Feruchi, Erna Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damia Pagnuquico's families and friends," says a report.
Five of them were pregnant women from Argentina.
The last 10 years in New York's Southern Court of Justice has been the subject of a death sentence.
In September 2009, Chald Barnes, accused of murdering two drug dealers, was sentenced to death.
For the last time in New York City, the murder of Julius and Esther Rosenberg was committed in 1953, and their marriage was sentenced to death two years before the war in the Soviet Union.
The Rozenbergs were both sentenced to death on 19 June 1953.
According to the case-law paper, the town of Zaipo in Uzbekistan did not show a guilty conscience after days and months.
The police say he's told the investigators how well he feels about what he's doing.
According to the charge, the Saipon authorities said that the attack was inspired to carry out the Islamic government's video on the phone.
He also asked the Islamic state to lose a sign in his hospital, says the police.
He didn't know him guilty of the 22nd conviction.
David Patton, one of the state-of-the-art public defenders presenting in Saipou, said they're clearly disappointed by the decision of the trial.
"We believe that the use of the death penalty instead of the death penalty without the right to release, without the confession of sin, is only for all participants in the execution of these events," Patton said.
In the past, the Japanese security team had asked the prosecutors not to order death.
A security officer says that the responsibility of the British army needs to be placed on the New Zealand Branch.
Today, during a protest at the Torie conference, Nigel Farage has sworn, "Mobilize the Army of the People."
The former president of the United Kingdom of Independence said that political actors should be "skinned by the warmth of Europeans", because one of Teresa May's reporters proposed that he be responsible for the U.S. wars.
Peter Bon, a member of the General Council of the Conservatate Council, told members in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be already outside, if Mr. Faraj was the president of the United Kingdom.
But Teresa Maye, the obstacles to ease her tightly interconnected lines, have been emphasized more closely after she joined the Tora's show against Braxitis.
I was opposed by the members of the United States and the U.S. attacks, and the commander is trying to keep his plan of action called Shashki.
The authors claimed that he continued his efforts to agree with Brussels, despite the opposition, so forced the Europeans and the Liberians to make a choice between his proposed map and "Cos".
In Solyhal, Mr. Ben said during a protest, "It's about to leave," he said he wanted to "remove from the chair."
He suggested that Mr. Farajy should be a colleague and take responsibility for the war with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have come out."
He added, "I'm going to finish Brexit, but we're going to have to leave the chair."
When he presented his opposition to the United States, he said, "We don't fight for the world's wars to be trusted.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon raised the assumption that the public opinion changed after the fall of 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and they want to remain in the United States is absolutely wrong."
Andrea Jinins, a Brazilian guardian, who also participated in the campaign, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, Captain, listen to the people.
"Sahamat" doesn't enjoy the great crowd, the opposition is not prepared to take advantage of it, it doesn't enjoy the complexity of our society, and the activists who come out first and choose us.
I'm asking you to give up "Sahamata" and start listening."
And she added in a warm statement to Aunt Maye, "The bosses keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said political actors should be forced to "feel warm" if they stand up to the end of the 2016 decision.
"Today this is a question of confidence between us, both people and politicians," he said,
"They're trying to fuck Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you kill it."
He added, "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class at the end of our trip to Brussels.
We mobilize the army of the people of this country, which has given us our victory in Brazil, and will never rest until we become independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the U.S. residents walked through Birmingham, and they spent two hours in the city center.
Several activists were exaggerating the signs of Tori after the last group was formed this week.
Leborist L.A.A.A.O.O.A.O.O.A.O.O.O.E.L.A.A.A.O.A.O.O.O.D.'s joke about the security issues that arose at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have all the TT technologies in Canada Plus to have a free trade border with Ireland," he added.
"This is all the face.
There is no sense in Brussels," he said.
How to "look intently" for pre-election options
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warrant says that after the November elections, there will be an "excessive" possibility to be presented in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reports that the democracy presented by Massachusetts on Sunday was talking about its future during a gathering in the western Massachusetts town hall.
President Donald Tramp's permanent prosecutor, Varen, has set up his initiative to re-election in November and is facing opposition to the representative of the government's representative Jeff Dile, who was the founder of the 2016 Massacutes.
The Asians claim that it is possible that he was forced into the Tramph River in 2020.
On Wednesday afternoon in Holioc, his 36th meeting with the electorate in the city hall was before Tramph became president.
One of the guests asked if he was preparing a lecture for the president's office.
Varen said it's time for women to go to Washington and restore the corrupt government, including the highest office.
The LSU's murder weapon has been arrested.
On Saturday, the police of Baton Ruggy, Louisiana, announced that the LSU Basketbolist Weed Sims was suspected of being arrested for murder.
Baton Ruggy's police department announced on the 11th of the morning to arrest 20-year-old Diton Simpson.
On Friday, they published the video of the fire, asking for help to get to know the man in the middle of the recording.
They burned Sims and killed him at the University of South in the morning at the university.
"Wide Sims has been hit by a machine fire and eventually died," reported police officer Murphy J. Paul through 247ports on Sunday.
Wade's been working to protect his friend and get away from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present at the scene and was armed and promised to fire on the White Simpson.
Simpson was arrested without any mediators and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a third-class student with 6 feet (1.98 m) in Baton Rouge, participated in a ten-game season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 units and 2.9 turns per game.
Louis Hemsilton is approaching the top of the world's champion when the team's opposition is winning over Sebastian Vetelle.
From the time Walter Botas moved on Sunday from Louis Hemsilton, it became clear that team competition would play a major role in the race.
From now on, Botas started well and almost hit Hemilton by the first two rounds, holding his position and calling Vetelle to work on his team.
Wetel first found himself in a bad situation and allowed Hemilton to be hit by a group of gangs, something that had to be decisive.
Mersedes later entered and went out after Bethel, but Hemsilton took a step forward, and the driver of the farm was trying to get out of the way, trying to protect the third floor after he took a second step.
Max Forstapen started following the tour network, and at the end of the first cycle, it was the seventh day of his 21st year.
Then he was the first in most of the race, and his goal was to get to the end quickly and go to Kimmy Rykconen, to work for the fourth place.
He finally got to the bottom of the 44th round, but he couldn't speed up the remaining eight rounds, while Rakconen went into the fourth.
It's a hard day because Walter worked fantastically throughout the weekend and as a gentleman allowed me to pass.
"The team has done such an extraordinary job in two accounts," Hemsilton said.
The Dead Sea Scrolls have proved to be very unsuccessful
President Donald Tramp made a mockery of Senator Diane Finstein when he finally claimed that Christine Blaise Ford, the President of the Supreme Court, did not issue a letter accusing him of sexual harassment.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not record the list given by the Senate's Legal Committee for Ford but explained that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and sad and lying."
"What could have happened, and the only wonderful thing that's happening in Santa in the last two days, when you see anger when you see angry people and angry people and lies and lies," he said.
"When I read mobile messages and shared information, they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, did you share the information?
Remember his answer... did you spread the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Are we scattered... "No, we haven't spread," he added, like the senator.
The letter of charges against Kawana was still sent to Führer in July, and earlier in September, it was distributed, but Fünstein denied that his office had spread it.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't spread his story," said Fünstein to the committee, as The Hill reports.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I did his request."
But his accusation did not like the president, who explained to the train on Saturday evening. "I told you that the body language was very unsuccessful.
Maybe I haven't spread, but I've never seen such a failure in my body's language."
By continuing to protect the Supreme Court of Justice, a person accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president suggested that democracies use these claims for their own purposes.
"They intend to take the power with them in all the necessary means.
You see evil and cruelty. It doesn't matter to them who's going to fight for power and control," said the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer broke two dollars on Giant's team against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars team took the lead in the Elite League team after a six-day debt, winning a five-and-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a match in Dundee.
The Giants received a two-dollar promotion due to the attacks by Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowley.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kaun compared the account, and after that, Douay restored Giant's majority.
Francisco Busher compared the account to Dundee, and then Lucas Lavald Nielsne's dollars gave them a victory.
It was Elite League's third duty for Adam Kiffi's team, which was headed for the first place on Thursday night in Belfast to defeat Dundee by 2-1.
It was the fourth session of the season between the sides, and the Giants team won the previous three matches.
The first dollar of David's was 3:35 minutes from Kendall McFol's pool, and David Ruterford gave the pool, and the Boyles doubled the bill's surplus four minutes later.
In the first round, Salvain changed the game to 13:10 minutes for the owners of the field, and then 15:16 minutes with the help of Matt Markurdett, he compared the account to Kraun.
Due to David, the Giants team's experience was taken into account when he broke his second round at the end of the first round of the night.
The owners of the house were reorganized, and Bushhar re-balanced their account, mostly with 27-37 minutes of broken glass.
Kraun and Charles Corron were united to help Nilesen in the end of the second round for the Dundee team for the first time, and he did all he could to make his team win the fifth player in the final round.
The Giant team, which now owes four of their five matches, has returned home, Milton Kens, and is preparing for their next match on Friday.
The air travel system dies by saving hundreds of passengers from the quake
In Indonesia, the air traffic control has been declared hero after all the means have been made to lift hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are thought to have lost their lives because of the powerful earthquake that has caused the tsunami on the island of Solavis.
In the area, there's still strong investigations, and there's a lot of people in the city of Palu.
Twenty-five-year-old Antonio Gawavana Agung refused to leave the city of Muttiria Sis Al-Jufre, in Palu, forcing his guardian to fly, even though his colleges were running away.
He stayed in his position and did everything he could to make sure that the number of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the plane at the time, could raise the air safely.
He then drew out of the travel manager's office when he thought it was floating.
Later he died in the hospital.
ABC News from Australia, John Sirett, of Indonesia's Audio Navigation, said that it is possible that the decision has saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a plane from Balcapaan to Calimanta to move to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, until the plane hit Palau.
"Our heart was relieved when we learned about it," he added.
At the same time, there were thousands of deaths in the view of governments, and the country's elimination of the consequences of the Alites shows that the entry of the cities of Donggala, Siji and Butong is limited.
"It is possible that the number of dead will rise, because there are still many plates under the plates, and some can't be removed," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an operator.
The heights of six meters have been completed in Palun, where there will be a mass transmission on Sunday.
The military and Communist planes get help and necessary supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Riza Kosuma, said to Sky News: "A minute's speed is bringing bodies.
The clean water supply is low.
The mines are scattered all over the country.
In Indonesia, the leader of the International Red Cross said to CNN, "The International Red Cross is quick to help all the others, but we don't know what's going to happen there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be worse."
On Thursday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Vidododon, told Paul and the military forces of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night for any assignment on the transition.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
This year, an earthquake struck the city of Lombok, Indonesia, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after the airport.
The air company now operating in the Gulf of Micronesia said that one man was missing, and it had already been announced that all 47 passengers and crew members were successfully displaced from the crashing plane.
Air Niugini reported that a man was missing on Wednesday afternoon.
The airline said it works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, trying to find a person.
The airline immediately responded to a request for more details about the passenger (the race or the nation).
And the ships of the plain helped to save other passengers and crews, after that the ship was set on fire, and the ship was about to land on the other side of the sea.
On Thursday, the authorities said that seven people had moved to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Sunday, and they all were in a state of shock.
The cause and the sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the U.S.R.R. forces both say that the plane has landed in the ground, not far from the airport.
Some people think the plane has come out of the airport.
American traveler Bill Jens said the plane was too low.
"That's too good," said Jans.
Jens said he and others had managed to get in the water to the crash exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the experts were in the trap, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Raspberry Powers have said that nearby ships were also helping rescue operations by bringing people to the sea some 30 feet (100 ft) below water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in the last two decades because of plane crashs in Papua New Guinea, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Verluccia describes the nighttime period of the murder of a woman
On Saturday, the court resumed its investigation against a man who burned a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Attorney General Paul Roulette, as an expert, has been witnessing for hours on the subject of investigation.
He told the audience how he used the cell phone records to bring a 29-year-old accused witness Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he was last killed.
Roulette said she had received information about the existence of several cells that showed that Telis had been with him on the night of the death of Chambers, which contradicted his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was near the Chambers' phone when he finally said that his friend was with Michael Senford, the police went to talk to Singapore.
Senfort testified from the witness's commission that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutor asked if Telis was right to say that he had spent those nights in the Senfort, he said, "That's right, because my carrier is in Nezhville."
Another misunderstanding is that Teles said he met him two weeks before Chambers died.
The phone records show that they've met each other for a week.
Roulette said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis had been down the phone with his communications, phone calls and contact details.
He said, "He's lost him from his life."
The protective side should start to present its final evidence on Tuesday.
The judge said he was expecting the court to pass on that day to the sworn candidates.
The High Breed.
A hip-hop bank wants to challenge the negative attitude of the music about that part, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group claims that the hip hop has been removed from its capacity to solve political issues and social problems.
They want to go back to its pillars and make the famous hip-hop again famous.
Such artists as The Fugees and the Commons have recently been transformed by such artists as Acala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
And one black school?
The bride’s wedding is judged by her husband for being fired after the “racist ” message
The bride's face condemns her husband to divorce her in a way that would break her apart after she got the wrong message that said she was "one black man."
They're married, they're racist, and they're looking at it as compared to "crowding."
The mother of two children, Lindsey Plasco-Flixsman, expressed concern at knowing that the new dance of the children was Sizel Moris, when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"WOOOOOOOOOOCH, AND MEK SEWAMOT," wrote Aunt Plasco-Fleksman in a letter to her husband.
But instead of sending her husband, she sent it to Aunt Morris twice.
After acknowledging his mistake, the "feeling sick" flicksman released Morris from work, saying that his current job as an African is bad, and that he was expected by the Philippines, says New York Post.
Aunt Morris was paid for her work one day and sent her home to Uber.
Now, Mauritius judges her husband by asking her to pay her off her job and expects her to pay $350 for the six months every day for which she was paid for her right to live in the workplace, even though she was not a conditional worker.
"I want to show them that you see, don't do that," he said to the Post, adding, "I know it's a misunderstanding."
The couple have responded to the charges of racism, saying that it was wise for Morris to get rid of work because they were afraid they could no longer trust him after he was hurt.
"My wife had sent him something that he didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people."
"But would you trust your children who you've been guilty of, even if it was wrong?
Your new child.
Give me the end."
The visit compared to the "crazy," he said that his wife had a child only two months ago and that he was in a very difficult situation.
"And you're going to follow one like him?"
"That's not a good thing," added the input bank.
Although the trial is still under way, the court of the public opinion has been quick to condemn husbands on social networks, condemning them for their detention and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers were afraid readers would not be connected to the speaking woman.
"It's hard to imagine someone who's reading it for the first time.
It's very fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success today."
He said that his father, who worked in BBC's office before he was inspired to write a book on a small scroll, added that the 60th year of the publication of the book caused negative feelings after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom he considered "the important member of the family," he added that his father was clearly proud of his likely success.
"She was a very modest man, and not a lazy person," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a child that has achieved something, you're proud of him, even though it's not really what you did.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Even though it was his creation and his appearance, it was his custom to give Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to give her a phone call
Immediately after the surgery, his daughter moved to the new Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Ned was calling regularly to say that everything is really bad that he won't succeed," said Aunt Edna Laparuz.
"Then I got a call from Ned, who said he would die in a few minutes, and I had to give him."
And I gave it.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, love you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who gave him the drugs to keep his heart at work gradually lost their power and got out of his body.
He was dead a while ago, and that was the end of everything.
I just had to sit there and wait to know that this would not be all right.
I couldn't sit or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Ms. Edna Laferrous, who had so far lost his daughter, but he and the passengers had moved up the plane, forgetting the experience he was in.
He said, "No one knows."
"I would have wiped my head, and my lips would have been broken all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was flying, I had an incredible feeling about Nede.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women were writing an open letter to avoid suicides.
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent other people from ruining their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey wrote open letters in Welsh later, with inspiring calls and phone calls that can call people for help.
Miss Davis' son Taylor was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, said his son was smarter than he promised.
"Everyone recognized him with his own smile.
They kept saying, "He seems to be insane!"
Nevertheless he left his work until he was dead; for he said, "The Lord was very poor."
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his own brother after his suicide.
And Miss Davis said, "I'm always afraid that this will have disastrous consequences."
Ms. Davis has prepared the openings, "To inform people that there are people who can meet and who can talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't stay awake, for you need to be speak.
Miss Humphrey, who had been Miss Davis' friend for many years, lost Marc, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he's feeling bad or in depression or something like that," he said.
"A few days before Holy Mother was born, we noticed a change in her behavior.
He was in great anguish because of the Holy Spirit. When the children opened their gifts, he didn't spare them, neither did he spare them.
He said that his death was a great shock to them, but they had to overcome it.
It's just destroying us.
But we must all stand up, and fight."

Brad Kewinha's status is very small because the HDB is starting the investigation.
"I think if we could really find what he wanted, there is limited time, limited environment, we could reach unity," said Mr. Fletcher on the Sabbath, adding that he feared that the committee was divided under military restrictions.
Why does Mr. Kevin and his government supporters want HDB's investigation?
Their suffering is only about time.
The mid-term elections have only been held for five weeks, which is on November 6, if such expected rulers fail, the country's highest court will significantly reduce their attempts to choose any person.
George W. Bush used the phone to call the senators to do their lobbying to support Mr. Kevin, who worked for White House Bush and who met his wife, Esley, who was the personal secretary of P. Bush.
What's going to happen after the HDB's account has been submitted?
In Santa, there will be elections where 51 percent are Governors, and 49 percent are Democrats.
It's still not easy if Mr. Kewinha can get 50 kilos in Santa, which will allow Deputy Michael Finch to get equal and establish him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's legislation has dropped down in Kimmy.
The number of North Korea's attorneys has decreased, as Kim Jong Wynn came to power seven years ago, said North Korea's law enforcement body.
Park Byeong-seug, looking at the information of the North United Kingdom, said there were 1127 legal attacks last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Paron Paris said that the stricter control of North Korea and China's border and the high levels purchased from the Mexicans were an important factor.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
Most of the laws on the north end up in South Korea.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally broken the border after the Korean War of 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the most narrow border with North Korea, and which is easier to cut than a well-protected protected military belt (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China refers to the refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often returns to their homeland by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically warlike, have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries have met in Pongang to fight against the use of intermediate weapons.
This was followed by a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Tramp and Kim Young Wynn in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work with the Korean army on the road to freedom from the Korean army.
But on Sunday, before the Arctic of North Korea, R. Jong John accused the U.S. scancians of reducing their success on the day of their implementation.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible to declare a military uniform," said Mr. Rainy in New York, U.S. General Assembly.
Nancy Pelos calls Brad Kevin, saying he doesn't fit in to work in the Supreme Court.
The President of the House of Representatives, Mr Pelos, called the Supreme Court's leader Brad Kevin, "historic," and said that he was not in a position to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelos made these comments in Austin, Texas, in the province of Tribune Tekhas, during the interview on Sunday.
"I couldn't help it, but I think if a woman ever acts like this, she's called a hysterical."
Kevin was emotionally critical of the charges that he himself had committed sexual violence against Christine Blaise, when they were both young.
In his opening speech, Kevin was very sensitive, sometimes in a dark mood, when he was talking about his family and school years.
He also publicly accused the committee's officials of calling the accusations he had made, calling them "simply inconsistency" by the Liberians who were angry that Hilary Clinton was held in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelos said he thinks that Kevin's order proves that he can't work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he's against the authorities.
"I think that he's trained him with these instructions and with his custody of Clinton and Democrats."
When Pelos was asked if he would try to accuse Kevin if his addiction was confirmed, and if the democracies formed a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this if he doesn't tell Congress or HDB the truth, he doesn't match not only the Supreme Court, but the court where he is now," said Pelos.
Kevin is now a judge in Washington, D.C.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the laws on the health of Mattuel or about the possible decisions of Kevina's opposition to the laws of his health or the laws of his own way, because he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In hearing of his stand, Kevin avoided asking whether he would change the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for us to leave this country alone, nor the time for the prisoner to wait for us to tell the good news of God."
And the woman has to rule it.
It's a fair sentence, the months and years of anger are out, and he can't be released without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinman 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a little bit like that, do I?"
He continued, "The woman who was the leader of some place who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she's built an opportunity that when she's angry and started to cry, she says to the person she's talking to. "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed to open up particularly because they are reasonably misunderstood.
One of my worst memories in a office where men were stressed, was when I was raped one day when I was crying out of unflagging anger, a woman of my age, a black manager from whom I was always a little scared, took my breath and gave me a kick to the stage.
He said to me, "You shall never let them see your tears."
"They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are sorry, but they rejoice that they are sorry for you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked in the pre-election process with President Gary Hart, who was appointed president.
In 1987, when he was attacked by a woman on a ship flying with a Monkey Business, and accused of extramarital relations, he came out of the castle, deeply disappointed that Aunt Schroeder thought there was no reason why he should not be able to participate in the election struggle himself.
"It wasn't a good decision," he laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven parties in the electoral struggle, and another trick was the last thing they wanted.
Someone called it "The White Bear and the Seven Tears."
Because he was late in the preaching work, he stayed with him as a banker, and he promised not to go to war if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a hard fight.
He found out that his supporters, who were worth $1,000, were giving him only $250.
"What do they think I'm going to get lost?" he wondered.
When he had a talk, saying that the official campaign would not start, he was so disturbed by the emotions (thanks to the people who had made him angry about the system that was so hard to collect money and the voters and not to exploit the volunteers, the hate about sexual harassment) that he was accused of.
"Karel thought I was in a neurological disorder," said Aunt Schroeder, recalling how the mob had responded to him.
"It was hard to think that Klenex was my corporate guardian.
I remember thinking what would be written to my graveyard.
"She's crying."
Like the U.S.-China Trade War can be held in China.
The first arms between the United States and China were breaking down, and the fight between the two countries could help China for a long time, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Tramp warns at the beginning of this year by setting requirements for the solar system, the solar system, the solar system and the aluminum.
It was a significant escalation this week when new issues were put, affecting 200 million dollars (£150 million) in total worth of people -- actually, it was required for half of the U.S. income from China.
The answer to this question has always been worth 5-10% in recent years, setting $60 billion on American animals.
China has promised to give the United States a valuable answer, and the world's second economy is hard to get by.
We have to stand up with Washington to meet the demands, but to be publicly humble before the United States would be too proud for China's President Si Xinpe.
However, experts claim that if Pakin is able to use his toys properly, U.S. commercial pressures can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the link between two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, whether in Washington or in Beijing, can create conditions for economic collapse in two countries is actually more dangerous than the observers had previously promised," said Abigail Regres, a researcher who is involved in the new Asian security review centre.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says the miner
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and it's been helping to rebuild the country over seven years of war.
Speaking at the U.S. General Conference, producer Walid Al-Mulam said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safer because of the advance in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore basic life.
Today, there are all conditions to ensure the return of refugees to the country they left because of the economic sanctions of terrorism and isolation that affected them in everyday life and in ways of living.
According to U.S. estimates, more than 5.5 million loved ones have fled the country after the war started in 2011.
And 6 million people still live in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam said that the love rhejim would be good to help restore the country.
But he pointed out that it would not accept any assistance or assistance from the countries that have led the rebellion.
Europe is winning in Paris’s Rio de Janeiro
In 2018 the European team won Rayder's prize, paying US team 16.5-10.5 in Le Golf National, outside of Paris.
The United States is now in debt six times in the European field and has not won any radar in Europe in 1993.
Europe renewed the title after the Danish Highness Thomas Borne team won 14.5 units needed to pay the United States debt.
U.S. star Phil Nikelson, who was fighting for almost all of the marches, sent the ball in water after the third attack, at the 16th time of the game, to Francisco Moulinary.
The Italian golf player Molinary won all the rounds, becoming one of the four players who have been able to win from 1979 on account of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Sceptin left out the winner of the 5th and 4th games, the Danish Tobourn Oliseen, the top-ranking player of the European team.
Dustin, the world's most powerful actor, Johnson, won the English Polter 2 and 1 account, which was probably the last time he participated in Rayder Gawatt.
The Spanish Serhio García, a part of the White Radar Gates, has become the most successful Europe of all time.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't move.
It was a hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose and trusted me.
I'm so happy that we're back in the cave.
The word is about the team, and I'm glad I was able to be useful," said Garcia after the European victory.
He's passing the water from his place, John Ramin, who committed himself to U.S. golfer League Tagger Woods on Sunday.
"I feel immeasurably proud after paying Tigger Woods a debt, I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods gave all four of his games in France, and now he's a director of 13-21-3.
It's an extraordinary statistics for one of the most famous players, who's raised 14 main title, referring only to Jack Niklaus.
Except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level games throughout the summer, the entire U.S. team was suffering for the last week.
U.S. senior Jim Fury, after a surprising game for the team, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought."
This morning, we've been pressureing the Europeans.
We're broken.
I'll take my head off to Thomas.
He's a poor old man.
And his 12 players came very well.
We'll be surprised, I'll work with the U.S. Professional Golfers' Association and Radi's Goth Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their age.
You need to be able to give the price.
We've been over it.
