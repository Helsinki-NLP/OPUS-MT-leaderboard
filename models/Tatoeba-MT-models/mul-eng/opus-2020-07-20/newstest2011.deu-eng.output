What should they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know the full place or the "Conditorei".
The new radicals of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain linguistic barriers in order to fully understand their former colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city.
The newspaper Aktuálnó.cz has been a little "deprived" by members of the new Council of ČSSD once again, as they have ruled the notoral Slang which has taken place in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were in Prague am Ruder.
The coded vocabulary, which was introduced in the late era by Oberburgermaster Pavel Bém by the Prague political elite, is some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new lines were missing something in the dark about these new terms.
At least they claimed it.
"Who's full place?"
"No idea."
"I'm rather a novelist in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new raptrer for culture, responded to the test of the "Patente-Vortatze".
But also Ratsher Karel Brézina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Gollow".
"This is the only expression of those you present here to me that I use and again."
"At least I don't like Slang much."
From the speech chart published by the daily newspaper Aktualnë.cz in June this year before the ODS election convention, the edition picked out six words, especially those that are notoriously related to the Prager Magistrat.
The social democracies should define the terms "Voldemort", "majest Prague Golfloch", "go to the conservatory", "Stianarchs", "Verat of the capital" and "revenge".
Three Prague racers agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Praguen Schoolesen - first talked about his participation in the conversation, but then he did not even take the audience off.
The fifth Ratcher, Petr Dolínek, dropped the test from the front.
"I don't care about these things, and as citizens' democracies hold together, I don't judge them."
"It is important to me how we understand ourselves under our programmes," he said.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the above-mentioned series that Roman Janousek is the talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he got when it was tested correctly was "the largest Prague Golflow".
"This is the tunnel Blanca," says Kaucký, adding to security: "But I know it better from the newspaper."
And he says, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" will then be distinguished not only by Matador Karel Brézina, but also by the ractorn for environmental questions Lukáš Plachý as tunnel Blanca.
But both social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort is and Lukáš Plachý knows where to find this figure and by what it means "to go to the conditionalaire".
"I think it means to go to some Prague gastronomic activity," is rather close to the solution in the Réxel, if you know it's about the seat of Janousek companies.
In line with Brézina, however, he means to have these knowledge created more out of the newspaper than he would have that word.
In fact, there seems to be no similar civilisation among the social democracies.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's no such thing with us."
"We call us by name, back and again we also use kürzel or spitznames," says the president of the Prager ČSSD Petr Hulínský - named by his party salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bríza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me so," Karel Brézina told us his name.
The newspaper Deník Aktualná.cz has tried the name and saw it - it works.
Ratcher Weinert is friendly to the party owners of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who was attentive to the choice of the party sponsors, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
These are the only names that allow social democracies to use their own language.
Hulínský may not appear to have been called "Hulda", but Deník Aktualní.cz registered another name of the president of Prague.
His Spitzname "Doctor of the Gumminimüpple Rights" has apparently done so that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to connect the folder of "Hexen" and gave a brochure out
Women who are forced out of school in Burkina Faso to Hexen usually display some common social features.
They belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are empty and they do not have children.
If one of these women "will become" to Hex, she will be severely isolated so that she will not be threatened by the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"You young and healthy women are also left to do this because they help with work and bring children," explains a sister in the capital city of Burkina Faso in a special home for over a hundred women who have been displaced from their communities.
The local government now decides to oppose this unusual "social action".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued that should link the "hexen persecution".
But it's got a hack.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" showed on the dilemma of the written statement.
However, in other African countries, the Hexerie is also going and giving.
In Ghana, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they took them with Petroleum and simply burned them.
This event was reported by the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would have been only a setback of unfortunate circumstances.
Your version will then be oil that will be used for ritual salvation.
And indeed, after the group tried to "an evil spirit" from the woman "to drive out".
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard for their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Fresing human souls are a threat before today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to eradicate the hexenjagd, the Gambian President has been working closely with President himself in the past year.
"After the death of his aunt, President Yahya Jammeh noticed a monster hexenjaggd, as they were supposed to have part of their death and would now try to bring the presidents themselves through black magic."
"This he called for the help of the nearby Guinean police, soldiers and the president's Leibgarde who took women and men violently out of Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Canilia," the Amnesty International said in her report.
On the farm, the underprivileged people were forced to drink a waste of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused darm and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not live on the farm.
First, because of international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A renter from Babala: He calls in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older supportive man just left the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlbaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments in Chechnya.
Under the arm a map with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for the own and the dwellings of his daughter and his son, who just has a port penalty.
All three were in the same context. "Deregulation" just increased the rent.
Instead of 3500 kronen months' rent, the son will be awarded for a 2-room apartment with the kitchen of the second category 4400 kronen in the next year.
"And there's no flowing hot water and heat in the apartment," he tweets with his finger on the son's new rental contract, to which he has full power.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-vote and half-sign.
BytyOKD.cz, which called the new conditions "inaccurately and immorally" is intended to prevent customers from signing the new contracts and wait until 7 December in which they think of public opinion as being against such contracts.
But the man's just waiting.
"One says this, the other says it," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region will thus become the great "deregulation laboratory".
After the new year, this deregulation is the most rented apartments in Chechnya, whose tenants have not yet paid any market-based rent.
Currently.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG space in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already nine hours early on this Tuesday.
Along the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a backup device with them.
"Miete 2011" thus lights a special keyboard field on the touch screen.
The device is short-clicking and already sucks out a number set.
We hardly missed the number "157" and they are already popping on the large display at the roof of the waiting room.
A half-second later you're on the line.
Some time later an older couple entered the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the entertainment in the waiting room is obviously not even applicable to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repairs, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts, with the new rental contracts, were the most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG Portfolios in the letter boxes.
RPG Byty suggests in writing an increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rents in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little bit over a week, which means it's only the beginning," replied the ladies behind the switch after a moment of tears when the "client" jumps out as a journalist.
Deregulation and balalas former mountain-working apartments are a fragile theme.
Before the elections, President Lubomír Zaorálek of the European Parliament of Ostrava had taken this issue quite casually, no wonder today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Never mind. WC-Brills could change them," says the man mentioned at the time.
So far, employees are particularly interested in the payroll to ensure that they are actually receiving the promised rent balance promised to them by the RPG if they sign the special offer at the right time.
In the interests of a half-yearly February, the remaining tenants who signed the new lease agreement should also come to the benefit of the half-yearly trade union.
So far, "Deregulatory switch" is in Havířov, but everything else is beyond demand.
"From the last 360 customers, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 were due here," the Schalter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall tables where necessary.
However, the contracting parties should not rely on the new rent, they shall be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a drooping, but it is as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal practice," RPG explains on its websites.
"There's no one going to court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre is at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (Kronen) interest, and I have 5,000 left for food, where I should take the money for a court war," he says.
Then the employees will be uncertain.
"Don't see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and thus wait for the people to come out," she continues to wonder.
The regulated rental ends in the largest part of Czechia in New Year 2011 and RPG Byty follows the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the company’s housing portfolio RPG Byty and - just the cancellation of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is according to the opinion of the owner of the main basis for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the single rents between 2005 and 2010, it was expected that there would be 5.2 billion in the four years 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display at the deck against the polyester cells in the Havířov Warteraum, several red lighting information is still available.
"The rent increases in 2011 amount to 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of the RPG's dwellings."
"This always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre and a month," is to read on the LCD monitor.
Only in 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase in extremely low rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre", argues the RPG.
At 2600 apartments the rentals remain at the same level in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push the rent to the height, but will take place gradually within four to eight years.
What more - the company has a further obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to re-enter the apartment, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heating.
But, above all, these people who sign the agreements on the rent increase should be welcomed.
The architects saw one - the office is also a child garden.
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.design.
But who would expect here a mini-kinder garden, with all that is involved: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-game space on the outer terrace.
These children's gardens have been available for the staff of Arch.design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the Ateliers produced a whole series of well-known brüner buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the room facilities for its company mini-minikinde garden.
In a weasel manner, because most of his 90 employees (in) are in the babyboom age and the company is placed on the ground that project and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, the children's garden is another bonus that Arch.design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers and architects have more eased their demanding profession and the care of children under a hat.
The Minikinde garden is an original idea of the staff (in) Arch.design and with the support of the management, they have been able to earn the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs funding for their project.
The operational mini-kinders are financed by the operational programme of human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's government budget.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2,8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be created and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the removal of the aid fund (2 years), the Society is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarten 3 years later at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place a year ago, where the Economic Rating Society provided effective assistance when the application was launched.
In order to care for the children fully qualified staff - a nurse and a nurse, the children can visit the children without ageing restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since it's about a mini-child garden, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day is changing over several children.
The childcare company is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights - without reference to the company hierarchy and their particular position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-child garden is still comparable to the pre-training framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, but they are offered excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, and they also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can look at the children at any time, and so the stress arises when the children are removed from a distant child garden.
Therefore, parents use their working time more productive.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employee relationships here.
Arch.Design thus selected among the Czech companies that provide significant benefits to new employees who are family-friendly and, through such programs, strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. Look at Gaudi's interiors
The roof needs to be like the back of a prehistoric excise, the steps such as the vibrating salt of a dinosaur and the balconies are raised fish mussels.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From these residents, the house, with its organic forms, came the top name "Knochenhouse".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, helmets, and mosaics, which remind of shoes and current soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fascade of the house plays with dream lines, dark colors and textures that remind of nature and life.
First, it is noted that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and transparency.
In the night, the whole fascination is still more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same smooth lines and smooth forms also dominate the inner house.
Well-formed wood copies the window frames, landscapes, track elements of doors, even gucklöchers and services.
The house Batlló in the fourth Eixample on the lively shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was built by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, probably the former industrialist Joseph Batlló, was originally at the rush of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper building.
However, Antoni Gaudí was not alone with the rent house Casa Batlló.
He worked with architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative residence of the real owner and also the use of music at the Fassade were created on this table.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the Fassad.
The joint work on the design of Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the park of Güell, where he also had other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Not long after his completion, the house came from the inhabitants of his organic forms because of the spitz name "Knochen house".
Another called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "extended house".
It is also said that all above the building was the sword of the holy George, the patron of Catholics.
But also other visual elements symbolize hidden religious motivations.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system for the time being with relief channels and typical fireplaces.
It's a little strange to see their 45-grade slope.
At his creation Gaudí ignored all the building regulations and did not allow any of these obstacles.
However, before the construction began, he kept the relevant construction approval from the city, but the information he had made on the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city’s fathers had been so quick two years later when completing the project that they requested assistance.
The raptors, among other things, took part in the construction of the building with its pillars even into the public building.
However, it was no longer, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the city district's request for it, Joseph Batlló submitted an application for the permission of the rent of the two highest-ranking buildings of the house - and it was promptly distributed to him.
The owner himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery at the 2nd floor there was a social salon, and in the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The earthquake was packed into a jewellery business.
The entire six-storey building runs a step up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the building, all the right angles and just lines were removed and replaced by built-in walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the Salon Towers and thus be able to make it easier for a larger society to listen without having to ignore a certain privacy when speaking more confidentially.
The house was also given a very unusual roof and two other stairs by Gaudís Umbau, apart from a new fascade.
Also impressive is Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed jackets with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the ceilings.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he failed to use the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight in contrast with it.
The Casa Batló House, which was included in the 2005 World Heritage List of Unesco, can be visited by everyone today.
In the first floor, the most spacious and beautiful apartment of the public is made available.
The owners of the house will decide this step only in the year and on the date of the famous creator's 150th birthday.
When it was found that this was a fairly demanding business, one held the visits, as it was extended to other shared and mental spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the construction site is not a piece of paper, which amounts to 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourists receive 20% discounts.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragons should try to close up friendship with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right matrices and the right bedrock? Women have desires other than men
Not the best beds, but the quality of the bed area - so matrices and rose make the good bed.
However, these need to be harmonised in order to satisfy the needs of the specific user.
When selecting, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health status, and not least the gender of the sleeper.
It is equally important that the interior in which the matatose and rose have been subjected.
A typical example?
In a weekend in which it is not regularly heated, latexmatets are not suitable because they need much longer to "heat".
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than normal polyurethane matrices.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough dilution channels in the core and are still on a hard drive, moisture is concerned: so it is not excluded that it is formed under its shape.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high matrices are common with wetting will be able to get used to a low matrice with hard surfaces.
"Well, all the Eishockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their expelled shoulders, shoulders and shoulders, they simply need a bottle of visco-scheme (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer). "
"I recommend this, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a breakdown of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamčýková, who specializes in dust furniture.
That's why I've been caring for many Eishockey players years ago, but also for other customers with visco-scheme (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, as such matrices are offered by the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous Eishockey player to appreciate the advantages of the visco scheme.
This "Wunder" actually works quite simply.
The shade optimizes its strengths and shape according to the absorbed heat, i.e., it usually smells on the warm body.
No matter how hard it is, at night you don't stand here like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscolastic layer also provides protection against decubitus (Wind fire).
When selecting the size of the matrices, you should still calculate the length of the feet, so it is approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women, who are 180 cm tall, require a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each shoulder should have a width of at least 90 cm, so together 180 cm.
In single beds, for example in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are added.
The comfort is half as well as for any visitors.
On the other hand, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should be still enough space for the easily converted arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, Vice-President of the Polish and Romanian State, who has been involved for many years in the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and this subject is also presented to universities.
In a double bed, everyone needs his own rose and his own matrices, but be careful when buying, so that the matrices are equally high.
On the other hand, there is nothing else left than to mount the roses at different heights and this is no longer possible at all stages.
Shoes should be at least 14 cm high, matrices with fibers of 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should fall on the shape board and the Feinpolster.
"With the hand or when connecting, the feds must not be in any case touched," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrice makes a special root type necessary.
All-polated beds with matrices and furnishings such as combined Siamwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These matrices are not allowed to slip and the relationship cannot be washed, which is already gone and given today.
And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l of Switzerland, it is clear that the matrices will gradually become a huge (and hidden) fish after five to seven years.
This is also the case with professional advertising blogs that promise a life span of up to 25 years, even long-term guarantee.
Everything's got her husband and daughter.
And that's why a practical advice from the dealers: When measuring 120 or 140 cm width, you should not look at the hygiene of the fragile, attractive relationships, but it is recommended that you use a matrix form that you can easily remove and wash.
Even if matrices are usually produced with round-clock closures today, so that after opening two-halfs (almost important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger matrices must be performed, especially alone, often as the fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a rose?
Oh, my God!
Or at least for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should view the plate with air bubbles (if they are no longer in it) and matrices with fibers and 15 cm below the height with so on. Use bag-federers and feinpolsters.
Polyurethane matrates are not included in such a description.
In the case of non-degradable latent roses with 14 to 18 federations (Lamelles), latex or sandwich matrices (e.g. combinations of latex and cocococs) are suitable (e.g., the combinations of latex and cocococs), the roses are always paid with a larger number of latrines, i.e. 28 and more federations, with lordosins in the field of pellets and the possibility to regulate the lattices.
There are no matrices with fibers, as they do not respond to ergonomic transfer.
In addition to setting up the flagship ranks, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
In this context, it is a special confirmation of the federal service, which enables the federal service to be pressed or even moved so as to enable it to allow the instantaneous suspension of the debtor’s debts.
Of course, for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even matrice manufacturers who have started to use haircuts for the shoulder area.
The women are also thought to - they are allowed these white zones in the wild.
For the most demanding customers, punctuated flying systems (lattoflex) or pinks with punctuated contact paths, including multi-torn feeding are determined.
The pressure is divided into several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (great and full) headgear for the right matrice and the right root, most benefits will be lost again.
Here is also a side line: the head pockets should support the head, its tops should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large pockets, such as the scanners like.
In the page box, the head pockets (with the shoulder load zone in the chest or the soft zone in the matrix) should be equal to the height of the shoulder.
Some of our modern matrices have mixed with the unique (filled with today) strip bags.
Modern manufacturers use more often natural materials or at least their fittings.
The new word "bio" is also used in matrates.
Instead of raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane foams more often natural oils - for example rice and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called by Matrates, whose core is of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matrices - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
It is also possible to send micropsies that spread fresh forest or lavender duft when sleeping.
There is also a difference between men and women.
While men are used as a "cooler" plant extract from beer leaves to absorb heat and cool the body, women have "heating" effects.
Extracts from red paprikaschots flow into the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes comfortable in bed.
And today's favorites?
Caltschaum matrates (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more active than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stages (hearts) of cold and visco layers, multi-zone matrices are created, which know exactly where heads, hips and hair are located.
However, for a high-quality matrice, you have to pick up 7000 crowns and more.
However, health practices are usually taxed with lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on the matrices and the rose.
Here and again there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers, the two matrices at the price of one offer.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the matrice duofreeze with Visco-shaum memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second is free of charge.
It was the material temperature that led the era of viscolastic foams with open cell structure and high density in close space.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
The temperature will cool at warm temperatures, it will cool again in a cold mile.
So it suits the human body perfectly and optimally distributes the body's pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure burning but also to increase sleep comfort in general.
Viscolastic flavourings are used not only for matrices but also for other health products, such as for special follicles that are to be used to make the bones and fats easier.
For example, local manufacturers use the raw materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of raising their own children and thus more and more parents tend to monitor them through GPS.
The system that was originally found for driving can be as good as people could, in such cases, be helpful as it would have been in the absence of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now as large as a cigarette bottle, but it should not have been bigger than a belt.
Many people have moved the case of missing Anička in fear and fear and thus keep their children better protected by means and roads.
Also for the price of a violation of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not about spying here at all but that it is an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Peter Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I suggest that in a single case, it may be possible to use such devices, for example, if someone gets into the bag without knowing about it, but we had not previously recorded such a case."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "chattel" serves and how to use it when necessary.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't want such a thing, it simply ends up his own.
"And very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"If the telephones had grown big at first with the parents, but they could easily turn off like these new surveillance devices," says Mrs. Bočková.
Your opinion is also debated whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"For planned performances, the kidnapper always controls practically whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged."
"Today's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for these as they would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step forward," the psychologists say.
However, it suggests that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
Roberta Čech from the company RC monitoring that local services are offered both for cars and for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set up in such a way that it indicates the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it is destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of toxic devices, even a measuring meter is integrated, i.e. if you like and stay free of movement, the device immediately sends a warning with the indication of the position," said Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services may also carry out intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only a special software needs to be played.
The problem with the current location device is that it is either about devices in the size of a string of wood-shafts, similar to the attached ones or on smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing it.
As a result, Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil is testing devices that look like normal digital years.
"This has the advantage that the attacker must not at all recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he notes it only after a certain time, which the police have a time-frame," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development is going - towards barriers or obstacles, the same technology will always be used, as in vehicle configuration.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many circumcisions that you could get rid of all Chechnya, but you can stay only two years.
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres south-east, and it has been burned with explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres to the army camper.
It is already too late to know that the fighting forces have taken care of 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of circumcision - two, but not more than four years.
The army purchased the coin from the company STV Group, a.k.a. for some 40 million kroner.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this violent quantity of zinc, the General staff MF DNES responded that soldiers would consume 60 kilometres of zinc per year.
The research of army pyrotechnics responsible for MF DNES is based on this statement that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of solar power stations.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be the case for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts applies that every new professional member of the profession will be fully sufficient to train two metre men, then the army has been created by these new purchases - even in view of the growing need for pioneer and special units - a satisfactory precedent for the already mentioned 225 years.
As soon as the Defence Minister Vondra complained, the soldiers of the fast-paced Brigadiers had almost no weapons patrols anymore, so that the lack of funds had been severely restricted.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I don't even know why they buy so many babies."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer who wants us to fight as dealers," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, argues that the sale of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur would have covered the army for at least ten years with this "munition".
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the police and army technicians for only two years.
"It may be possible for the four years mentioned to be in perfect storage," says one of them, who wants to stay anonymously, not to be seen as a soldier in the army.
After the period of use, every ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not extraordinary, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 455 kilometre zendschnur.
"They cost us six percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," said the speaker Pejšek, with the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics by police officers, liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brothers' army has been increasing for some years almost 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that they can still use before the end of the period of use.
The safety of the Pyrotechnics has already been ensured, and thus the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore more reliable births is open.
The Ministry of Defence has faced serious problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-hundred-hundred-and-a-half thousand Chechoslovaki People's Army was preparing for its appeal to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnics responsible for MF DNES, in a few years the same problem is expected by the Czech fighting forces in the case of the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old infants, which they have purchased so "good" today.
To this day, the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
Lukáš Pytloun has helped to sell his hotel in France.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the competition last year.
The history of his success must be seen as a film scenario.
You like to close the Pytloun trip.
First, he was aware that in Liberec there are no reasonable prices for having a good night's stay in the country.
From the savings of his vacation abroad and with the help of a bank credit, he established a permanent house with five apartments.
Remember that he was a high school student at the sixth semester of his life, this must have been a courageous reception.
"The price-quality ratio of the day offended me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He rented the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire profit, which he then built for a step towards pension with 54 beds.
After only seven years of entrepreneurial activity, he was able to open four pensions in Liberec, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable one of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In this year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our French concept and other stakeholders at the Francis of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number One of the last year.
"A large share of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just been the victory in the competition "Amployer of the Year", Mr. Pytloun added.
The victory has brought him greater fame, population in Liberec and the environment.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even at night, and I have to say it was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't need to win the same, any visualization is good.
He says that he is benefiting from contacts and knowledge that have not yet been reached.
"With some people I've met with thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relations."
The peace associated with success is still a little lower than any of its employees.
And then there's the 7th.
"I note with them greater loyalty and confidence that they are part of something that will be shared by the general recognition."
I also see this as not only personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is only in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my followers a peaceful year when we had it in farm.
The victory victory was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind.
In the past year, Karel Ždárský, the company owner of Farmet, took the price for the first stage of Vodafone’s competition.
The jury then praised the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice to start a company from the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this award not only encourages me but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort was made to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žðárský as a compensation for the Communists' property, he did not long ago leave his career in the company in which he had been employed, and set up with several cameras of his father a own company for the production of plastics.
A short time later they began to concentrate on plant oil presses.
In 18 years they have grown to the largest producer of automatic press in Central Europe.
But only through success in the said competition and its mediation, it has also become aware of non-publicity.
"Not only is our customers making the brand farm more intensive now, but our foreign partners also started to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žðárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory.
The valuation was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of industrial products.
The crisis, which at the time was less than the citizens, but above all the companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to implement their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't get out of this situation."
"The sales went back to 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even get fired," says Karel Ždárský
In the meantime, a viable company must also take such unpopulated measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation in the grip and keep the company in the black numbers, even though with less gains than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not interested in making cuts - in investment in research and development.
"From the board we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired key prices at domestic exhibitions," says Ždárský.
All of this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnover is growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"The new winner I would like much joy on victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žžárský.
A question of opinion which is covered by unreasonable rules
The question of the "insurance of the year" is for the fourth time part of the company's competition.
Some unreasonable rules have already been made to get out of the world.
To the two-sided winner of the next year's opinion, "Absordity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents to authorities that are available online.
More than one third of non-four thousand voting entrepreneurs were selected.
Thus, the Social Insurance Administration requested a paper extract from the Trade Register, even if it could have been obtained by the officials by two clicks of mouse.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require exemptions from the trade register in the future when checks of social insurance fees are carried out," the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Buranóvá said.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion "insurance of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the ceiling to meet the entrepreneurs in Czechia and to raise the uncertainties.
This year is already the fourth part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech Economics (HN) and enjoyed in the public growing popularity.
If the three thousand people were involved in the vote in the past year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations to serve alone and alone to stop business.
"For example, with regard to the number of income tax forms, we take a step forward in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators in the Czech Republic.
Simplify entrepreneurship in recent years is the declared goal of all governments.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in Chechnya has barely improved.
According to the World Bank, Chechnya takes the 74th grade in terms of company conditions, compared to the previous year, one of eight places is worse.
The competition of the year was first launched in the year, and each year plays after the same scenario.
Each Member may report administrative and bureaucratic failure from April to the end of the competition.
The Web address is www.ffaroku.cz. Then the competition organizers are looking for seven candidates for the "Antiprises" and allows the public to vote on the website www.ffaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
This is the absurdity that comes with most votes.
This year's opinion has already been reported more than a hundred, exactly as 105 meaningless regulations and arrangements have been reported.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from trade unions and journalists.
For example, among the so-called "Finalists" of the competition, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles have to be paid for roads and fast roads or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must be prepared every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The opening of the competition each early November at the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of an event, which includes regular participation in the personality of political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and business operators of the Czech Republic, as well as Peter Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, was at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state connects entrepreneurs between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to raise at least thirty paragraphs per year, which are still unnecessary for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unreasonable arrangements from the world show the effect.
In 2007, the majority of entrepreneurs were under an obligation to notify the company's office at its place of business three days in advance of the intention to carry out an exhibition or a performance.
This obligation has been lifted by a novelty of the company law.
The obligation to report to the Agency for the Services of Employees in the range of up to 30 days, which was granted the second largest number of votes in 2007, was abolished by the law on them.
And all good things are three:
To the absurdity of the year 2009, the Regulation was chosen, which imposed physiotherapists, to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the living room.
This Regulation was amended in some ways by the Ministry of Health this year - the carbon obligation was abolished.
A new category deserves socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the economic journal (HN) is the category "Responsibility-conscious company of the year 2010".
The main reason for this competition is to promote meaningful and fair businesses.
"We would like to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon's mobile company, the appellant and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special sub-category of the Vodafon main competition firm of the year, companies that are not the only long-term goal of success have joined the company.
The history of each of them is extremely inspiring and rich enough for a self-sustained article.
Although they differ in the nature of their activities, their efforts have a common denominator - support and feedback.
Here, for example, it is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague Software Company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, then participates in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a fund for disabled children for over seventy years.
A paper factory from Poddebrady is also responsible for its health-care-related employees, 70 percent of whom were awarded the title "Responsibility-Responsibility Company of the Region" and Vodafone Company of the Year was awarded the third rank in the competition.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft, which introduced, inter alia, an average working time of 35 hours a week, which was reduced without a relatively low wage.
The jury also respected the fact that the company was mainly purchased by Czech producers, supported citizens' initiatives in their environment and worked on environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our business activity and administration to the environment as little as possible," explains her business leader Milusche Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Sign up from the Ústí nad Labem region has been placed in the health of its employees and therefore it has made them available to all of the notebooks ergonomic sexes and keyboards, as well as to encourage them to use Cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not", which provides specific assistance to this Roma community," says Ondréj Suchý, the representative of the company.
In addition, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištíní" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to the interest insurance of their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We have provided our employees with contributions to provide, to the way they work, to increase their qualifications and to leave," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntal, the winner in the Märish-Schlesische region.
The responsible company of the year was automatically notified to all regional finalists of Vodafon’s competition company of the year who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the notification and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law enforcement companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "The most responsible company of the year", but they were not disqualified in Vodafone company's main competition for the year."
"A separate login to this competition is not possible only because it is only a sub-category of the main competition company of the year," says Karel Goldman from the agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - Police arrests at a public hearing
In the construction of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took steps in the last days.
This was carried out by the former media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. by the detectives in handbags.
It was said that it had tried to manipulate an existing public competition for the recovery of refund claims in such a way that the basics offered in the competition would be of particular interest.
This is supposed to have paid half a million luboš G. for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the delinquent behaviour in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner state government government of the newspaper "Právo", which could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
How he managed to manipulate the public competition can only be speculated in the light of questionable official information.
The Land Fund spokesman Lubomír Černá referred to the question of Pravo, which the police had actually taken action in the vicinity of the Ground Fund, during a public competition.
"It was about a client and about one of our employees," she concreteized.
Ms Černá's public competition followed the correct name "Requirement for the award of claims for the transfer of basic goods under the law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants showed interest in the proposed item.
"These persons offer a higher value in terms of demand than the excretion basis value of their claims to be accompanied by the transfer."
"In accordance with the tenders offered, the sequence of the potential contractors will be determined, and the bottom fund will then transfer the basic item to the person with the highest offer," explains the Fund's speaker.
Luboš G. clearly provided information on who had submitted to the request, and since he himself was a eligible person, since he had bought a number of refund claims, he indicated that he was of a principle that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat recovery.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had such a large amount of money at his arrest.
Luboš G. had very good contacts with Pilsner Ground Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former Chief of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he had issued basic articles in replacements, which had already been issued on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the bottom, for example, also acquired basics that were intended to build public roads, said exactly at the site where the construction of the entrance magistrates was planned for the Borské pole area.
Later, he met with the Master against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the basics.
At that time, the Council had to lay a heavy heart in order not to threaten the construction project by blocking the basics.
Housing costs increase by a few hundred a month
Since January, households must not only account for higher costs for all energy types but also for higher water and water costs and also increase the rents.
Since January, families will have to draw hundreds of crowns a month more from the port month than before.
Power will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities it will be necessary to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also to supply the remote heating supplies.
Only the electricity management costs the housing costs a few hundred more dollars annually.
The strong electricity prices were collected by all main suppliers, so it is important to promote electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic installations.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to warm most and have the highest consumption.
So it's also here with a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for city heating are different.
In particular, larger locations plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than $1,000 per year to families in Liberec per year from January to January for remote heating.
The inhabitants of Prague also pay 9 percent higher water and water costs, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure industry.
If the rents don't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, is still the lowest in comparison to the whole Czech Republic.
In the northern regions where the prices are now the highest, water and water charges are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
There are huge price increases, for example, to be expected in 120,000 apartments, where the rent regulation is missing from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, has the rents from January to increase by 100 percent.
Anyone who is not in agreement with this rent increase wants to take a legitimate interest in the company.
Regular rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, have to rise by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drink with remote and Rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Remote, Rum and Wodka, except for a good whisky, which you stole from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks that must be treated for the benefit of Czech teenagers less than 15 times the most.
No exceptions are children who have to get their cat back in the hospital.
This is from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children in clinics.
"Bears or wine are completely out of fashion, because it's just too long before you drink."
"Today's trend is clearly stronger than alcohol," said Přávo Ludék Pelikán, the head of the child department in the medium-term clinic Horóvice.
"Wishky, if it is possible to use the father a bottle from the household bar, and if not, then at least a remote or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is right.
"For the most part, it's on the phone or Rome."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also very simple about Slibowitz, which was taken from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán is therefore no longer an exception for 30- or 14-year-old drunks in the hospital.
Before the clinic in Horóvice, where he has been working this year, he has been working for ten years in the Paediatric division of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars delivered prisoners from Nah and Farn.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"They started their career at 12 years of age when they were first delivered with 3.5 Promille alcohol in blood and then in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition area in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that even her mother didn't notice that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief wondered.
Simply the lack of parental interest or their incredible tolerance in dealing with their own infants is considered one of the main causes of growing alcoholicism in children.
In order to be truly independent in the true sense of the word, experts do not follow in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term dependence on alcohol, as well as all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In those who continue to enjoy alcohol, it is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chafarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital’s motorcycle, Ms. Jurinová, was introduced to the present department for children and young people’s medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol consumption that made a hospital stay necessary are included in the statistics.
Deprived children who are brought to home after an ambulance treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only once had a bottle of Schnaps in the school bank, there are three annual amplitudes in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán, on which one hundred percent of leave is: Walpurgis night, Silver and the end of the school year.
"The last one for two reasons - either from the chamber because of the bad witness or from joy on the holidays."
"In the night of the Walpurgis, I have also experienced seven drunk children once in the recording," said Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is far better off than a child who only has to fight with an unbelievably cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be spread in the hospital with a fluid-sustaining infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They're clearly better off, because after the "heavenly" experience at night, they wake up with good sleep without doing anything wet."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán points out, where he at least earns patients through the good wages by telling them the costs that they will be treated.
Because transport with the rescue car and the night comes in an acute bed well and is willing to take a few thousand crowns.
"He and again I used it as a means of getting out if I had told the children directly at the visit what their drinking cost and that it could go through that they may have to work through all the holidays to earn money for such a single fat," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, he did not consider the cases to be a regression procedure in order to require the parents to care for the injured children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light combat vehicles L-159 of all five who have been replaced by the Czech Ministry of Defence against Casa C-295M transport aircraft have been flying to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish Air Force manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are located in possession of a foreign army.
In the country, they had just seen Mannovers or Flight Shows.
It's about the flying two-party version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When sending the aircraft physically out of Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, who is not yet known as the Minister of Defence, is not yet known.
The L-159 single combat aircraft was again separated from long-standing aircraft, without further investments and investments from the Ministry's resource.
"The double-siding L-159T1 was replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Pravo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without 2nd combat vehicles, since the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the construction of four L-159 superfluous to the second version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second of which wants to take over by the end of this year.
Pejszek has subsequently committed EADS to implement the fighting equipment in one of NATO countries.
"In the contract, it is clear and clear that the company is an EADS carrier of the L-159 aircraft and that they should serve as pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the receiver, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The economic newspaper (HN) further reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The sale of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of another $3.5 billion aircraft was still authorized by Mirek Topolánek's government last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase, but EADS spoke directly.
The then defence team argued that this exchange would support the future exports of L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she only uses 24 of which she wanted to consume the rest.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a court record.
The European Commission submitted to the Czech Ministry of Defence, namely the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken three casa aircraft, which will land within fourteen days at Kbely Airport.
A longer face finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose display finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostatic cancer.
This is the amazing result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This should be associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostatacrebs, and this is especially in men up to sixty," said the associate of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostatic cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, Ms. Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostatic cancer, while also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand finger was less short than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostatic seizures was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and display finger were the same length.
In men whose display finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk was 33 per cent, and in men up to 6 per cent, even 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers already formed in the parental age clearly reflects the different mirror of sexual hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator finger.
Previous studies have found that the testosterone only accelerates the growth of prostatacrebs.
Václav Pačes, head of the Czech genetics and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, had known him very well, but he did not maintain the relationship between the fingers and the cancer risk so far.
Chechnya in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just as the largest part of Europe is also in the Czech Republic on Thursday morning under a cut.
On the streets and slopes there are usually fixed snow, the winter servants were mostly all night on the axis.
The D5 highway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozwadov is blocked by accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
At a mile of 91, a LKW failed, two LKWs fell together at 93 km, and there were injuries in this accident.
A few pkws are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at a kilometer 185 of the D1 highway in the direction of Prague.
There are also two Lkws together.
The drivers should either drive behind Brno at 190 km or over Brno and drive at 182 km at the place of Kývalka.
There they form a mile long stop.
There is also an accident on the D11 and the same at the time of access to Prague.
In Prague there is a few centimetres thick snowflake and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons form, for example, in the city of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely closed.
The safest means of transport is the Metro in any case.
The roads run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and peaceplace.
About eight o'clock in the morning, the Prager Kristenstab will meet.
There are also problems on the train and on the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast-track connections due to snow movements.
There are problems, for example, on the road Prague - Kralupy or even Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should inform themselves of the current situation.
The Ruzyní Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Seas are only accessible with increased caution.
For Vyškov, three side streets are completely unfavourable, in the area of Brno, there are rather snowy movements, and in the area of Blancko it is forced to use snow-drifts on some of the above roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three streets are still closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
Here you will also have to use snowflakes.
If they are re-managed, they can't be underestimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is given in the area of the white carpaths.
On the roads that can only be driven from natural protection grounds with inert means, a length of up to five inches thick snowy, led by ČTK.
In Chechnya, snowflakes fall from two to ten inches [2 to 10 cm], most of them in northern mountains - literally up to 18 inches [18 cm].
In the Mediterranean region, up to 15 centimetres of Neuschnee fall.
But in Chechnya, it's slow to snow.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only as their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the existing conflict with the Taliban and move the relationship of forces to their own interests.
The new weapon is something like a supersonic cannon.
Your project will be reached through laser with a few meters of contact security.
The special shock of caliber 25 mm developed for this threat and containing highexplosive explosives works practically as small granite.
The shells can be programmed so that they can explode not only at the top of the target but at any point of their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use it against a enemy who is hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a shelter grave.
From above, it is usually not protected, so the killer steel plates from above can easily put it out of force.
Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, is the first weapon of combat that uses "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier goes on the basis of this: he sees the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he wins a precise point of view, after which he corrects the raised angle, then he just needs to print it out.
"Let's say once, you measured 543 m."
"If you press down, the weapon will open up and shoot the gun at the distance 543 meters plus less than one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are lost
The Fujitsu Group loses its lease in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year 400 employees will be placed in the Astro Park from the former office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group, Fujitsu, loses its lease in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, in July 400 women and men will be placed at their workplace from the former Marienbader building in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyon Street in the city of Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that more than 100 other jobs of the group should be allocated to the region, which has been distributed to the region.
The offer of rent has been extremely attractive, and the large burrows in Astro Park have been better opposed to the working methods of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
The competent business leader Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central location with excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt Neiderrid".
The excellent connection to the airport is just as important for a global company as Fujitsu.
The new turnover of an important company within the region was an early joy in winning and disappointment in losing.
Frankfurter Economics dezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again a "Global Player".
It was a "great local knowledge".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for the Netherlands.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city has been informed of the purpose by the business director in the morning.
"We have naturally offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts had nothing to do with the difficulty of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the real estate at Marienbader.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise to the challenge.
Now it is going to prevent a long learning at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far and the nearby "Little Verticals" were among the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago at the most controversial construction projects in the city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer between the railway station and Rathaus, a new city centre was created, which provided both for the massive construction of the areas used in part as a parking space and the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001 the company's consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel systems, startup Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and a year later it was sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu concierge in Tokyo is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The Netherlands in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, however, the largest of the most employed is Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad is intended to be Fujitsu Services and a company on behalf of TDS.
For this purpose, Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped basis - has its seat, inter alia, in the central chain of electronic technology and electronics industry.
Amazon shut down server - Drunken vs. Assange
Wikileaks is becoming more and more depressed.
The Amazon Internet service provider has connected the encryption platform to its servers.
It is possible that there are hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats who are behind political pressure after publication.
Wikileaks-founder Assange appears to be in England.
The Wikileaks burial platform is increasingly powerful in the United States.
Internet activists lose access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the Boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's prison list, is to be held in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wickleaks from the Amazon server are destroyed."
"Free speech in the country of freedom," the enthusiast activists shared with Twitter on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had linked Wikileaks documents to its servers.
Internet activists had withdrawn from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic frauds in order to manage the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter Wikileaks further explained: "Prima - our dollars will now be spent to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon had stopped using his server by Wikileaks, after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff had conducted research, the CNN television transmitter reported on the office of Liebermans.
The president of the Senate Committee for Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boycott, reported by the British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Dearman therefore called for the platform to ban the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unrecognizable and unrecognizable actions put our national security at stake and threatened around the globe's life," said a message from the semi-profit senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks-founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden for rape, is on the Interpol prison list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the findings in Sweden as the intruder of his opponent.
Wikileaks speecher Kristin Hragfsson said in London, it gave dreams.
"It even called after Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange was right about his safety, said Hrafunson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked that the official responsible for the Wickleak's funerals should be prosecuted and brought to trial.
In Canada a consultant from government chief Stephen Harper said - apparently ironically - on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a drone.
Between the white house and Assange, an exchange of shells was set up.
American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, said that Assange had called for the return of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recent claims of spying on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US government is now covering the protection of its databases.
As a special agent, the Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, shared the White House with him.
Travers would be responsible for developing "needed structural reforms" which were necessary after the release of the message by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US Government also announced that they should be threatened by the Wickleaks publication in order to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists.
"We have taken everything into contact with them," said foreign speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice-collars are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice coming from?
From gelatium and gelatium.
The gelatier, in German a little alternately of the icedientor, sets the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-mapping art.
The gelaio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a spaghetti, throws it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about Eis, who does not come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The University of Eis has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that ice creams from his machines will be justified throughout the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also daily special courses about chocolate and practice in the home.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply drive on the smooth ice of their wild sights.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an artist from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to work in a nerve-free job for years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice section in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in her bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master Galatier Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only good taste, but also the sweet taste and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the singing of the national and overall South-South overrun: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then every amount of Romantic is there."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano taps the groundnuts of milk, salt, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mix, which builds all at 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools up to four degrees immediately.
Then he lifts up a hair on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base screen, based on all kinds of milk.
The doctor is immediately asked: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you run your own experiment loss free?
Luciano warns to let himself be led by the journalist into the Irish.
Anyone who speaks of icecreme "only from natural ingredients" has, however, used stabilisers - most of them a natural product, about guarkernmeil from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabiliser, only then you have to sell it within a day, otherwise it falls together, and the customer is on a lot of ice cream.
Certain variations to the basic mass are allowed.
It's going to be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are sold in the fruit department or at the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to give you thousands of aromatized additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Both in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or at the ice cream from the white ground mass that becomes ice cream and cocoa powder based on all possible chocolate performances.
Now the trainers can ride the trainers.
Luciano is able to produce four different types of vanille, chocolate, mokka and haselnus ice - with or without eggs in the ground, with more or less Vanille aroma or other natural additions.
The same experiment will also be used for fruit varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit-purie - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnus ice does not taste even more fresh when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mix has the taste of a gelato right above it, says Luciano.
Exhibition is a calculation task: If Pfrsich purie is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar component must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A extraction sugar is needed for lemon oil.
Luciano has a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzer measures the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computers easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help automatically produce the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mix is simultaneously creamed and cooled at low temperatures.
All automation on the roof will not remain small panties.
The Brazilian Gustavo wears himself and his college colleagues from above to below with fruit purée, when the over-dimensional steel mixer has no control.
"In any course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something happens."
Double-declining depreciation [d]
The European Food Authority Efsa has been underprivileged by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This project is now formulated by the Expert Group of Test Biotech, which is understood as an independent institution for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Test biotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been also under contract for years with lobbyists.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Cooper has been working closely with the Efsa rules for breeding plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The Efsa regulations would be equally valuable to Ilsi's position papers and therefore the industry's manual, which is actually to be controlled by the Italian Parma authorities.
It has already been the second time that testing biotech is a collection of interest.
If a high-ranking efsa manager is still young without a set or a transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Singenta - and has changed the pages accordingly.
The Mediterranean Roundfunk (MDR) has also recently concluded a personal link between the EU control authority and industry, which has made the environment as well as the EU Parliamentary.
However, the Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
One turns back on all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, that is an opinion.
Experts working for Efsa did not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you have to open it.
Cooper's work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) is being carried out in the United States.
This itself is called a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts like Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding test in animals and the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts will not be tested.
"We want to know what, for example, technically modified maize makes on the acker," says Then.
At present practice is simply isolated proteins, but not to test the whole plant, which does not prefer any reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how should you find them?" then he asks.
The same is true of Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently active at the Technical University of Zurich.
As in the United States, the industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discourage critical scientists in Europe.
That's why there's hardly any researchers who haven't been involved with groups.
In general, critical studies would not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The trail of the rocks
Uli Gsell has also taken care of himself, totaling about 400 kilos.
At the Montagabend he stood in the shape of Stuttgarter Train Station, the tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's broken.
The story is known: In September, the baggage was stopped and had started to break off a large piece of the northern plane.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: thousands of demonstrators demonstrated against S21, the thousands of thousands of heavy bombings of the railway station.
When it got to the top of the building, most of the plane was in drummers.
Break in 6000,7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grave stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a housekeeper in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got a couple of brakes.
"These stones are reliquies."
"They can't disappear."
He exclaims: "A cheap and poor stone, easy and underground."
When he woke up, he had a cigarette drink.
What he's gonna do with the brakes, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Stone leads to a forest at Tübingen to a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stone.
He bought all the people who came to Stuttgart at the time of April.
"It would be a shame if they were thrown into a pit or disappeared in the warehouse," he said in his office, a wooden hole that was once a guardhouse.
He was shocked and threatened to tell him, when he was in the newspaper in September that he had bought the rest of the North Flight from the operator.
But he's been talking to the S-21 hostages for a long time.
And he told them that he couldn't even do anything for abortion.
And if it happens now, then it's the most sensible thing if the stones continue to be used.
About 200 S-21 geneners, one of the 80 kilograms of heavy quader, with a share price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reflection, some of them also hope to be able to give it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large Lkw loads.
About half still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, farmers, households.
They had come from everywhere and had removed what could bring coffeerooms and trailers.
The Stuttgarter stones of the Anstos have long been transformed into "Mauerle" or limited to grasslands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He rides in his car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of rich land.
Jura has studied and broken down, later biology, then he has become interested in computers and has finally become a stone dealer.
And Stein's lover.
40,000 tons of stone stored.
From all over Germany, he shares his treasure together.
He said he was the biggest old-fashioned dealer in the Republic.
It's hot.
There are artificial sandstones in the snow.
"They belonged once to Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, hot, he's cold.
"My Lovelingsstein."
It's going up the road through the woods.
It shows on a hill: red sandstone, former part of Karlsruer Railway Station.
And keep going.
"Dear Travertin."
First, the square belonged to the tribe of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Over the snowy stone and stories, Cannstatt Travertin from the Stuttgar police station, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbroner Hospital.
What kind of work, what tastes, what kind of sweat.
If rounds think about how the stones were lifted by hand and moved with simple bottled arrows and oxygen carts, he will be quite frightened.
"It would be a scandal if you were to hurt something like that."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't even been rocked yet.
But 14 people are working today, and the stone dealers have also laid themselves down in the woods of stone, a painting house, a smile, a glass glass and a garden building.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the restorative.
First, he has to go to Cologne.
There's rocks there too.
High-potential tally
It's King Andrang at Buffet.
16 Students strive for milk bread, tomato soup, and soybeans.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the autobuilder Volkswagen have invited the machine-building and design students to a workshop.
In an idea-making competition, together with VW developers, they should get to know the car of the future - and all along the people's cars.
In the fight against the worst leaders, many companies are currently engaged in the fight of nerves and, like VW, are engaged in cooperation with universities.
Your mission: The most dedicated graduates can recruit in the hearing cells as soon as possible before they get into the labour market and become recruited by others.
And since universities do not issue any ideas on the performance of their students, you try to slow down the exceptional metals in practice projects and join each other.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car companies will be around the talent.
A young lady from the staff department distributes books, rubber bars and maps with VW logo.
She tells the promising young people of practice programs and student jobs and shows them the way in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig maintains the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students are in contact with industry and collect experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, attract interested candidates, and pass on who comes into question as employees."
Such cooperation, so rare, is not unusual.
Newly, it'll be so offensive to the students.
"We must focus on the professional project," says Sele.
The fight about the fresh gradients will probably become even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer look at their employees from a large range of applicants.
But they have to offer themselves and fight for highly qualified labour forces.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineering VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering success is becoming even greater according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes to the Talentjagd for the inspection and consulting company KPMG.
It organises exciting Recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting-edge, where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company to the United States in the next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG files and get to know the company.
Anyone can decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Créme de la Créme de la Créme of many beers fly in the United States.
The protection of the high potentials at universities is increasingly evident in the skin and legs.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Just a simple sailor was too small for us."
For Talentjäger Dykta, the account seems to go up.
"To this day, we have contact with all participants in a similar action in the last year."
"Some will stand shortly before their end and want to appeal to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct budget at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classic when measuring their professions on the market.
"We're trying to reach graduates on trade."
"Evva on Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, a personal leader at the Solar Technology Manufacturer of Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the growth problem.
At present 35 posts have been posted on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to have comfortable positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the Uni-Professors.
Solarworld works with various universities, about the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can practice with us or write your diplomas."
Your ads are not reported to solar specialists.
The company is trying to acquire other advantages for itself: Personal atmospheres, flake hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't often be offered by a large company," says the staff leader.
Money is no longer the main trolley in the search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good growth opportunities are also crucial factors.
Solarworld conducted a study of the Great Place to Work Institute's 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual list of German employers.
It asks employees how they are satisfied with their work and their field of work and looks at the conditions for employees.
Staff leader step also expects additional points from the location of the job seekers.
"I think that the applicant looks particularly after external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Wareler from the German Employer Branding Academy tells companies that want to build a good reputation as a employer with a long-term strategy.
He's saving his customers for more authenticity.
And that means, according to warmen, in particular internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is to guide your own employees," he says.
In the sector, the internal employer branding is called labour market training within its own company.
"Happy employees are the best messengers."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would be hired by friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"It's like a game with bands," says the fighter.
Obama stops new oil drills
In the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new olive groves in the US state of Florida in the coming years.
An appropriate ban has been imposed by the government in Washington - and therefore their former plans have been completely rejected.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drills remain underway.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Exemptor for the strict prohibition to be applied for at least five years is the explosion of the Bohrplatform "deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost 11 workers their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his readiness to release new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The sponsors therefore want to reduce the dependence of the US on foreign oil imports.
Anyone who carries the responsibility for the glorious olive oil in the Gulf is not finally cleared up to this day.
At the centre of the crisis is the UK energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry in the order of Obama will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop after the explosion.
In addition, various oil companies had applied for new drill projects.
With strict controls and strict security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been subjected to numerous corruption, will be substantially reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close luxurious tax exemptions for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The Government's plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by BDO consultant firm - even before the ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also regrets the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new aid projects would be kept up to further - allow for growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is beer, it is abundant as at the tank station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the nature of Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live from fatty steel, corruption and illegal alcohol.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't give up," the eco-activist urges the journalists: "You're still getting enough oil in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerians have tried to expose a young man waiting in the water to thirst with the sludge around him: the scene is almost beautiful in the rain-coloured water-coloured glass.
It is not to be seen that the surface of brown roses is floating under the surface.
Previously, she had gathered garners here, told Esther Badom on the edge of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flow of liquid water would be complete.
Five years ago, it was grown from a frozen root ledge in the huge fatty area.
Fishingmen from the nearby town of Bodo now need to take six hours to get to fishing water: Ogoniland, located in the heart of Nigerdeltas, is considered one of the worst affected regions in the world.
On the road through the mangrove pumps carried by the river run, the whole dimension of the movement becomes immediately apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat throws brown bridges up, the one whose hand drops into the water takes out old fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees, like black lactating branches from the ground, are tragically left to hang their roots.
Bird fevers, as they are otherwise common in wet areas, are seeking forgiveness: as soon as the outdoors are moved out, the old paradise, which is like a tank, spreads out into the splendour-like paradise.
"What's happening here is environmental warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war has been made.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battleground for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe were involved here, organized here in the 1980s with later ex-executed writer Ken Saro-Wwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production in 1993 because it was dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still refusing to return to Ogoniland: During the entire three-phase region of Switzerland with over 5000 drills and 7000 kilometres of drilling, more than two million phases of the black gold are being pumped daily, while the oil fields in Ogoniland are so unstable that the group is in position.
All a few hundred meters of steel, such as strange sculptures from the water: "Christbuzuchen" are called the heads of the bohrlöchers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to Mark.
And then again, one of these bunkheads breaks apart, means Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have been flown into the Delta's ecosystem for 50 years according to expert estimates: the amount of oil per year, as it was during the summer of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the continued eco-GAU will be challenged.
During the shell-groups Sabotege and the organised oil steel responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmental protection guards see grass-roots heads and beautiful Pipelines as the main cause.
Shell lay significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner spoke to the Group in 2008: Only the rate of defects in the guidelines would be "of a variety higher than otherwise".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oily workshop under free sky, the mangroves come from the mangroves: they are split into pieces and until the neck they are covered with oil.
Under one of the many fascists that are partly connected with rhohrers, part of which are deliberately scattered on the ground, a fire is flickered: an illegal small refinery.
In the phase, the oil is built over the fire for several hours, Michael, the leader of the group, explains.
First, Benzin pushes through the rhore into the start-up area, then falls down at the end of the direction of kerosin and finally gets out of Diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four feet a day, Diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Delta residents use the chronic lead button in the largest state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The slightly low Diesel price with almost 40 Euro cent per liter can still be subsidised by illegal cooks: because their raw material is also obtained.
It comes from "bunkern", which the pipelinenet has been called by Ogoniland: In this way, experts say the country will lose at least 16 million litres of roh oil per day.
However, only a small part of the provisionally interspersed raw material is unlawfully distributed: the iron component is filled with organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking soldiers, in tankers and they are being placed on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is the cause of the population's resurgence or the low production method, holds Akpobari as a clean academic activist.
"The oil companies would not be regarded as aliens and would not have destroyed the life base of the fishermen so fundamentally, it would not have given neither Sabotege nor Dibstal and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell was especially destructive, but only one withdrawal of the group was asked: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese are better off."
Michael's getting nervous.
"The highest time you lose," says the Musculoskeletal Olmans.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil dealers are deprived of the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not arrested, but perhaps a painful blow.
They also want to benefit from the raw material, like all Nigerians.
"This fucking witness has brought our country to the dog in any way," says Akpobari.
Detector detects hazardous construction errors in A380 drives
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
In the investigation of a land-based machine, researchers have discovered a possible construction fault that could lead to a "distortion of a disaster.
The Fluginie Kantas wants to blame the engine manufacturer now.
The passengers of the famous Kantas Airbus in the beginning of November had apparently been much happier than ever: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the work of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the event of an oil connection, he could create a risk of injury and leukemia, which was the opinion of the ATSB authority published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic trial case".
They were designed by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
This includes the Kantas Airbus, which was to be registered in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided a basis for complaint at an Australian Federal Court of Justice in Sydney, which allows it to take further legal action against the company.
Kantas-Chief Alan Joyce said his airline will require damage for the crash in early November.
At the engine fire, parts had been dissolved and the surface damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil as the cause of the damage.
After the crash, up to 40 pilots have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further security tests on the superjumbos equipped with the works concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, ATSB speaker Martin Dolan said.
The security problem has been considered too important to inform all concerned.
After the landing of the Kantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines released about three of its eleven A380 passengers on the ground.
The airthansa changed its work as a precautionary measure at A380.
The two-wheeled pilot is the world's largest passenger plane.
Countrywide snowfall removes traffic noise
Germany all in white: Over the night, nearly all the country has snowed.
On many roads, Chaos, trains and flights fall.
At least three people came to life in car accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: At the required temperatures, almost all the Republic will be cut off on Thursday night - which leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east there are partly 15 cm thick snow blankets.
On several roads and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was extended, but it was not finished with the constantly existing snow.
In addition, heavy waves swept over the coastal coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency (BSH) is expected at the Baltic Coast Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning on storm flows with a water stand of 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxony, snowflakes on the roads and federal streets were causing serious problems.
According to the non-competitive central media, the highest level of alarm level was reported in the Swedish Switzerland, which is why alarm level was violet.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of snow, fresh and strong wind provided for movements.
There are several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
In Saxony, police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to amazing traffic and noise.
In Thuringen, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Germany, there are major disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringen and North Bayerns.
The main problems are snowflakes, broken trees on rocks or broken surfaces and wetlands.
In Saxony, the distance from Leipzig to Nuremberg was to be set.
In the Thuring Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with firemen and rescue aids with wool blankets, food and drinks in the train.
Snowflakes hung over the streets.
In large German airports, snowflakes lead to numerous flights.
In Munich, some cancellations have already been reported, according to a spokesman of the air navigation centre.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been hit by a Fraport speaker.
The winter service will be in service forever.
Although there were only a few isolated passengers at the airport, they still have nearly 400 field beds ready for them.
On many roads it has already happened on the middle of accidents.
In the evening, a Lkw-farer came to life at the assembly hall with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The locker was easily damaged.
In the vicinity of Nürnberg, there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: also here a truck was found on a train passage because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver came back to life.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had moved with her car to Aschaffenburg on the smoother road.
But the meteorologists still have good news: Although the snow will still be soft and pulverized and therefore it will be at ease.
But the wind is going to disappear.
Only the Ossetian is sought out by fast and exciting winds.
However, it remains very cold - either way up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her wishes
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for both offices at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could contribute to the real estate.
Only recently did the German Bank make its concentration good: the wheeling towers in Frankfurt Banken district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial companies are trying to recover the cost of the renovation - and they are looking for a buyer for the two houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes to a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale were not mentioned by the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then reassess it," he said.
As a result, Germany’s largest credit institution is already running its business after a short time.
The Bank had only received the double threshold for EUR 272 million from the owners of a home fund in mid-2007 and subsequently managed with a high level of health.
The energy building was estimated at around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring much money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the newspaper’s towers, which are listed in Green Towers, resulting in about 500 million euros.
Whether the building is resuspended to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, whether it is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands Disappear a Whole Couple
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the crushed mountain ranges that were declared after several explosions in a mine for dot.
Still, the bodies could not be protected because the safety layers in the accident are still precarious.
Just two weeks ago, there was a severe explosion near the town of Greymouth in the Pike River Mine.
29 mountain workers between the ages of 17 and 62 were beaten down under days.
A sin had been committed in the accident, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to rise for safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts had concluded that there was no more chance of survival for the team.
The bodies could not be protected until then.
Now members and friends with a memorial party are reminded of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand's southern coast at the alarming Sunshine in Greymouth.
It's been two minutes.
To the honor of the scattered mountains, 29 tables were set up on which helms, lamps and the names of the group were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothing items and surfs, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the fleets were almost half of them.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains "from the depths of the earth" would return to the surface, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the memorial celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Laurie Drew, whose son was shot in the grave.
In addition to the prime minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African origins were also destroyed.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the south coast of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas has been destroyed, it will begin to cool down the exciting temperatures within the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for artkino?
Director Nicolas Winding Refung re-examines the old general limits with his fighter epos "Wallalla Rising".
What publication could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Remfn have in mind when he ran "Wallalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his punishers and has almost superhuman powers specifically placed his opponent - sounds ideal for young male visitors to seek bloodless action, just because our hero likes rabies methods of killing and his enemies have already escaped the warmth of the living body when he has a bad reputation.
On the other hand, comments say, as he is actually called, that the whole film is not over word, and the other figures are at least allowed to fit into one or two sets or a couple of quelling deaths.
Others will be moved and in the very beautiful Himalayas Scotland, which the Viking world offers the Kulises some thousands of years ago.
Ideal more for adult cinematists with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It's nice if a movie has several target groups, it's only harm if they're excluded from each other.
Director Winding Remfn has been using his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but is reluctant to make his works with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the art house.
Most of the artkino fries should be removed from the splendour of the brain and the nerves.
The action-Fans will die no later than long ago, when, for free interpretation of reasons, they send out a bunch of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and establish an eternity in fleet and nebel before the people appear in America and move further.
So no wonder that "Wallalla Rising" in Germany has not found any cinema rental and has just appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the beautiful pictures, but also because behind the pretentious façade to the bloody façade is hidden a bit of exciting piece of kino, which deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogue or a strict action, it's all atmosphere, a filmful feiber room.
And from it there is no entrance for the viewers.
Reffn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and speeds him up with his necessary pictures and the window Transceiver soundtrack to slow down the neck, but especially with the incredible hair that compares him from the heart of the figures.
Only a small pale young man, who trusts on the side, keeps himself as innocent as anyone else will be moved by Zorn.
Most of the common people, whose motive is never declared, will at any time become a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, which may be the messenger of the devil himself.
He means destruction, but maybe only for the innocent.
"Wallalla Rising" is a racing film that you can hate and admire, to care for, raise and stand.
An experience.
Direct work on land
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country remains to take a position - it can still control it.
By midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting aircraft attacked a mysterious, wild-flying building in Syria.
It stands on the edge of the Euchart; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-saur.
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which has apparently built Syria with help from North Korea in the Quader, is hidden in a valley that escapes from the current.
According to a letter from the US-Ausland Secret Service CIA at the end of April 2008, it would also have been well suited to create plutonium - from which the nuclear weapons were built, by the name of the nearby site El-Kibar.
For other purposes, however, the technology is rarely derived from the fiveziers.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unscathed satellite images.
Through computer animation, they highlighted what components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which was a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbion nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the start of the operation, but it had not yet been filled with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is almost more known than at that time, since the councils have become larger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush has recently realized in his memory that the CIA was quite sure that Syria had built a reactor in El-Kibar, but soon found that there was an "active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a "problem reactor", even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plaisible".
You don't have any hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of himself, a high UN diplomat in the summer only responded to lapidar, who the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The protection of the alleged "unused military buildings" created the Syrians honestly and planned the land thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar trails from Uran, which was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from a Member State of commercial suppliers from time to time following the attack that might be more powerful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always meant never to operate a secret nuclear program or to have a reactor built.
The uran comes from Israel's armies, Damascus declared.
However, this proved to be an unlikely return to the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Seither refuses to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it calls for the control lights to have a second inspection in El-Kibar and access to the drummers of the bombed building.
But Israel also weakens.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed young Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "increased into a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA's seat in Vienna - in conclusion a serious breach of the nuclear weapons agreement in the room waiting for the IAEA.
As a key to progress in the declaration, the IAEA clearly sees three other facilities that should be "functionally connected" to the requiring reactor - and yet more than that.
The inspectors have not so far identified what facilities it is dealing with, what function it has or what they appear suspiciously.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to as Marj as as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah in the IAEA and are again driven by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified this place and established a building complex at Masyaf, where it is likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or immediately in addition to a military support point - with this very reason, Syria of the IAEA is refusing access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent from the United States to withdraw military facilities.
Because nuclear detectors have become aware of the facilities by means of a tip of U.S. secret services.
The IAEA has indicated, including satellite photos, that material was imported and retransmitted between the three places and the square at the Euchart.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be "in relation to fuel production".
But there is "no reference to sensitive activities", so uranium recovery or reconstruction; processes needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uran, which is not sufficient.
But where the Uranus was to come and where later the Plutonium was to be removed for the bombs, these central questions are all subject to plausibly confusion.
It is also unclear whether drums that could mount valuable trails were stored at the three locations.
If the hundreds of trucks were to disappear from the ground, no one wants information about where the protection remains.
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat, Salzmine al-Tibni, which in 1998 was examined by Syria as a warehouse for radioactive mills, is unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought her into contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Records from the Orbit show, however, that Syria took over the three suspicious places of work and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has been using several months to develop an inspection plan there that would allow Syria to verify any military secrets - alone shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
In fact, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had been weakened, the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter had no high urgency, bringing some US messenger Glyn Davies, a few months ago, so-called special inspections in the game, one of the most severe means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he is still late.
There is a high risk in this way: for one, there is a majority in the Governing Council of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than a scalation.
Others, like a diplomat, think, "What if they find nothing at all?"
Love in Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working at her so-called Régiedbütt in summer, there are concerns.
The book has written itself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more is known about this - but it's enough for rest.
Suddenly, the hunger, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love during the Yugoslavian war in her Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some of the three days planned in Sarajevo were recently transferred to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women's war victims wrote about the UN refugee relief work UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is himself a messenger of the UN refugee relief work.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary several weeks ago, but what they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in violencescamps have not given it, and Jolies holding the victims told you enough about the Drewbook.
Your organization has recommended that the UN refugee relief work be abandoned as a messenger, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her book, has given some hint and her approval to Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author himself claims that she does not pursue political views with her film, has worked very hard in the Yugoslavian conflict, wishes to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the contents remain visible.
So a second synopsis of film on the network, which then sounds quite different: The lovers could be there before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are thrown into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds very different, though, than the variant "Violence Victims of Violence".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - it's so safe.
The pressure on her, Jolie, is "unfailing and based on misinformation".
Now you can probably only get the hackers from Hollywood peace: by putting the drive book as many times before, illegally.
Nothing like out here.
This evening it is finally running right around the Irish again.
No trace of surgery.
To that end, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans jolt in joy at rocking music, they stick with their feet.
The balley pub in the Southern Cork is because the players shoot and meet the tableballs over a three-metre distance in beerbecher.
"Bierpong" is called the strange spectacle to win, there is 500 euro victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this brilliant drink game and the back-up computer that doesn't really fit together.
But the 26-year-olds try to avoid the question of what the future will bring.
On his plan, he is not in Las Vegas, and he will be conducting applications in New Zealand in January.
"I have a feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I haven't got any work there."
Emmerhin: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had gone, got her wishjob as an event manager, maybe a good sign," the young man says and laughs.
Because of bad perspectives, two of Tanners have already sought their happiness abroad for three weeks.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT brother in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it appears on the island in many families.
100 000 Ireland is likely to leave the country in the near future, said experts from the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Research in Dublin.
By 2015, they even numbered 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, it will be comparable to the one in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of excitement, which led to great prosperity for the Irish, it now spreads itself again.
In particular, the economic crisis ensures the young, well-educated Irish, for which it has been only a mountain.
The loss of employment and social growth seemed absurd in the years of the tree.
Everyone was used, there was money in excess.
But three out of ten women and men are out of work.
In the Irish Times there are also readers of young immigrants who complain: "All is going down the Bach in Ireland."
"There should be opposition to politicians and banks - but who can, go and lose our country."
"The last one makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, looks forward to a bright future because the government is doing only eye-browsing and offers young people no more prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-olds.
It observes how their comilitones are drawn from an unpaid practice.
Your biggest concern, she says, is that you have to leave yourself in four years.
"This thought is tragic and oppressive."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to make the subject positive.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a round-up service to work abroad.
"Work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first step on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website show photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but it also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to be done for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just take a fashion house high.
In January it goes to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
His home is seen by O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra payments to pay the loan for his house.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, when he takes his home for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am as good as ever."
He laughs at something and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a nice residential area with furnished facilities, in the parking lots, large, expensive cars.
Along with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380.000 euros for four years - 100 per cent of credit funding.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could happen with the credit?
O'Donovan gives up a long, hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes on, I can start from Newe."
The construction engineer does not want to hear what he is hearing today.
"No one should be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a long time, which is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who has gone to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open up and just look at how it goes with life everywhere.
A few years of work in London has already been behind him, and why shouldn't it run well for him and his friend in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is that he belongs to these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could happen in a life-saving party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and drinks a great fortune from his beer.
"Life, it sounds overwhelming."
"We'd rather call it a street party, quite funny, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democatrian Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private enterprises.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results resulted in the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This question has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
There are two facts in this year's survey from September and October, especially in his eyes.
First the Good Voice in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries at the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been restored since the strong collapse in the last year, such a trend is to be recognised.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most affluent countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% in their government. Both values match those of the last year, but there is a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises were undermining efforts to increase democracy.
This also happened during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America were experiencing only a short recession phase and have recovered rapidly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(As reported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the rate of poverty in Latin America rose only slightly, and this year it fell again by 32%.)
However, there are strong differences of opinion from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the different president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a broad-based approach.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was stronger and committed violent crimes, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the investigation, many questions in Latin America in crime in their country have seen a greater problem than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
About 31% said that either themselves or a member of the family had been victims of a crime in the last year. However, 38% in the last year, the values were low and thus reached the lowest status since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents said that the private economy was indispensable for development in 2007 was 56% (see Figure 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has been publicized by many private companies.
Brazil has reported 19% of respondents (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
In Mexico and most Central American countries, however, the most influential country in the United States has seen this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A menu bar
Nobody expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts overemphasize the fears of the electors, who claimed to help the affected country.
Overwhelming elections, multiple votes, election appearances in the ring, broken elections, and beatings were just part of the problem.
Selection area opened with hours delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom became homeless by the earthquake in January, were searching for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A thousands of presidential candidates, including some of the required leaders of the summit, called for the withdrawal of the election results due to an alleged report.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as right in many interests".
According to a cautionary statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities make them so serious that the process is not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is entrusted to the unfathomable President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Celestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected choice is for January.
There's still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial complaints of invalidity.
If Jude Celestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, is explained by the electorate to win the election, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earth’s victims still live in cells, a small selection was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, about 250,000 copies needed for the election were not yet distributed.
It's a lot on the game.
The parties considered a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves have the same opinion.
Secretly in the Middle East
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy, which led her popularity rate by 20 points over 50% to the top. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you help this in the next year to re-election depends on whether the apparently grieving Cristina Fernández compromiser is her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, also following his wife's choice of economic policy, often set out budget plans that did not take full account of taxes, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to issue extra revenue on their own behalf.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost most of the Congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27th led to further conclusions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Persians stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after Chaoto's meetings (when a parliamentarian struck another face and others visited the government of the occupation) it was not possible for the Congress to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I won't discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, which gives the President more opportunity to spend money on his own gifts.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow to up to 9% this year.
For example, the official rate of inflation is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and the wages requirements of trade unions - range from almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was hit by economic crises, explained growth and the fight against poverty in its main objectives, not the decline in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, dissipated the private sector, and established the National Institute for Statistics and Populations INDEC, which in turn praised official inflation statistics.
Can Farnández now include a more moderate way?
She called on the private economy and the trade union leaders to speak.
And official statements should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation is undermining the growth gap by a large devaluation in 2002.
It is possible that Cristina Fernández would, for this reason, want to re-enter the rest of the world financially.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to insist on an agreement with the money providers from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Churchers had always refused an audit by the IMF, as otherwise usual.
However, last month, economic minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in creating a new national consumer price index. It looks like this would be the first step to take on the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her career, even without the support of her husband.
If so, they need the support of the media, which is largely sufficient for churchmanism.
If the Argentinans return in March from their summer vacation, the wave of sympathy that you have been denied will be abolished.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she will make many political decisions for her husband and raise them lightly.
Poor apple for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the country.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother outside the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible electors, rose to choose mayors and mayors in the five urban districts. This will be assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of bus-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of the relations with the country. Her policy has changed the relationship with China's mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma's got the test, but just a little bit.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) has established three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which represents a greater independence of Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the votes received by KMT by 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the majority of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city boards.
During the election, it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck coaches with Krawall Makers, flag-skinning massages and only bright-skinned dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honour president of KMT, held a speech on a KMT candidate at the election,
When a man from the crowd struck him, Lien was wounded and killed by an ally.
It is not clear whether the protection of lines was intended to kill or fight with the candidate.
In spite of this, the approach was called Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, who influenced the choice and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Noteworthyly, the relationship with the country has not been thematicated.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their real independence and fear China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like its relations with the government in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also prevents the anti-Chinese feelings from being too loud.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, we want to confirm that the majority of Taiwaneses are promoting their Chinese policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy to turn Taiwan back with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a contractor to Taipei to prepare a summit meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but first of all.
It is therefore more likely to be followed by the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has found itself in the meantime.
Two years ago she was very weak: the former leader Chen Shui-bian because of corruption in prison.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he made a major contribution to absolute independence.
However, under the Thai Government, a new generation of qualified politicians developed and the DPP was fighting for the votes of the professionals and young people.
Tsai, as presidential candidate of the DPP, found great agreement, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party now does everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plants an idea mix as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, sets forward open-ended discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustful alternative" to mass early approach to China.
Chen seems very disappointed about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates had done better to be independent of Taiwan.
He even called for the pragmatic Su to abandon the presidential candidate.
The DPP also finds it difficult to choose its potential candidates without being admitted.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-assessment.
Most values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to fight without it.
The main reasons for his lack of love appear to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between poverty and wealth.
According to a KMT speaker, he will reorganize his office as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only threatened with limited re-arrival.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no more return."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was wonderfully awarded in the Newcomer category of the year
If you answer a president's question, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the 2009 Nobel Prize Award at the ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was appointed to the Newcomer category for this year's Grammy.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since its album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears somewhat unusual. However, it is in line with the Grammy rules that an artist may have issued at least three albums before publication of the album, which he was known in the wide audience.
Your glorious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its impressive voice and a good taste for pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spartaning peacefully with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of naming Slidings next.
In addition, the "History" album of Vijay Iyer Trios was named in the category of instrumental albums. This love of the critic was the result of a huge follow-up.
The competitor Iyer includes "Moody 4B" of experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positoothly" of the keyboard John Beasley.
Thrombone Shorty, a romantic favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which other albums are found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk Musicer Darcy James Argue received considerable attention in the category of Great Group. So he takes a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader against Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurer Dave Holland and his Octett, whose life album "Paths" is a good example.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a beautiful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestras with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", is presented as an eclectic orchestra, with three votes.
Among those nominated for connections to South California, Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and executed in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer of Avner Dorman in L.A. was also appointed for his Mandoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestras, operas, chor to solo receptions.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the famous classic albums are Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertebouw Orchestra; Daugherts "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificum - the Art of the Castrati" is presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
The opera category included the mountains "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and Chor of the Marinesky Theatres; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, party for Symphony No 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionation Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Parts Symphonie No. 4 was executed and recorded in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former olive oil engineer Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dormans "Mondolinen concert" received a nomination in the Instrumental Solo category with orchestra.
The composer of L.A. said that he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for Mandoline artist Avi Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tone and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The director Pierre Boulevez, 85, received a nomination in the category orchestra department for recording Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As an instrument soloist, the pianoists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the genius Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year only women were appointed as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie from Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vicica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Class Crossover category, Sopranistin Jessee Norman was named for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosquee in Temcula won the approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula after a five-hour public hearing often resulted in the unanimous announcement of the local planning committee.
Critics wanted the project to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to the Commission's statement on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre conforms to local regulations and becomes an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There's only a few enemies," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, where the votes on both sides were distributed equally according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the page of the newspaper.
"There's no America anymore," said one comment.
"It is another planet of openness, and the state of freedom is still in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on 11 September 2001.
In Temcula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmousch called for violence.
Its community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they had rented with a manufacturer for water filters.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two Minarettes and to become about 13m high.
It is intended to be located on about 17,500 m2 in the main area of Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still challenge the project at city level.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on earth or otherwise.
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria, including arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is their view that life is also possible without the elements previously considered essential for life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs to grow either phosphor or arsenic."
"This makes it very special, although it's almost a form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies from the Arizona State University and Co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
To date, six main elements have been considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor and sulphur.
However, as scientists have discovered, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake continue to grow when it replaces phosphor by arsenic.
"That's what else is possible," said Co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists must recognize life and its forms, so on.
The study consists of microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were known for the discovery, allowed extensive speculations on the Internet that the report of the discovery of alien life could be carried out.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms can implement biochemical processes using other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we think are absolutely necessary are not necessarily established," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, selected the Mono Lake because of the high arson content.
Since Arsen and Phosphor are chemically similar, they assumed that the microbes that are exposed to both may replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the chemical attitude of phosphor."
"It is therefore difficult for the organs to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that Arsen is different from phosphor. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it is almost all smiles," explains Anbar.
The researchers set out the GFAJ-1 bacteria at an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe is growing better in phosphor, although it can survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsen-based form of life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, more often on the arsenic.
According to Jamie S. Foster, doctor for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea is that phosphor can be replaced by arsenic, not new.
Arsen came more often in early years, she says, that is why science has concluded that early forms of life have used it.
"There is reason to believe that life can also have evolved differently than in the early age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Symon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Find other stolen exhibition sounds in Compton
The other two of the four exhibitions that were stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the statement of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs on Thursday.
The four exhibition sounds - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknown to the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were delivered before a Bellflower Motel 6 night, are reported by the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
"The good news is: the dogs are silent," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate data on the background of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The findings are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some trails."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for guests.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district hall in Downey in reception.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery car and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old red, and Didi, a 10-month old hüddin - were reportedly unharmed by the authorities.
However, the Corgis Bunny and Peter, the Rickard and Peek wanted to represent their Japanese owners on the competition this week, remained missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the nearly-one-month tour of the pair of dog views.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the hotel.
They often stay in hotels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer waver, a parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with her motel.
The dense Akitas and Corgis remained in the delivery car because it was colder there.
They let the window open a column so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m. as stolen.
Peek promised to anyone who could give a hint to the corgis, a finding reward. The animals were introduced microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet determined whether a finding pay was paid.
Once again, after the legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a new Yorker contestant officially awarded the “prepared” faith plan to raise the debt of $5 billion and to open the 86-year-old maintenance company the way for new films and television shows.
According to the announcement of Thursday, the plan fulfils the requirements of US competition law, so that the re-start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglas Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to around 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is actually in force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM products.
At the moment, an investment bank’s consortium, which brings itself $75 million, will run the company. The funding will be in mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio started in May 2009 with the mandate of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, which fought against interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the business leader Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring experts, known for his activity at Krispy Kreme Dughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve MGM's finances and to pay more than 140 believers in the studio lasted longer than expected.
Following monthly discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction took only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the believers.
In the spring of this year everything began before the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was signed by the believers at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM officially won the competition in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly for the company’s management of $375.000, receives a "follow-up bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. In this year, the studio carried out only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
In addition, they plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in Co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio therefore needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films that are to be created under the reign of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has funded about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder is him.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in equal weight
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Video console. Both games can be a huge deal in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX rows for $99, while the price for a kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump lines or about 48 doses Play-Doh.
But you may already have your gift budget.
I recently visited three electronic games in $80 three national players - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I was immediately informed that Moore's law was in force. This year the technology instruments are more efficient and cost less than in the last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of these types, websites and Club Penguins.
There are increasingly buttons-manufactured toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable battery.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plastic figures, as large as seaweeds that sing a note when you press on your bag.
Once you press a note, you can play a song by multiple clicks.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in Harmony.
Attention: If you have started with the pressure once, you can no longer stop.
The Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animated doll exchange games such as 'Symon' are provided, and thanks to the new snowflakes, they control the moon-walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dancer. However, their parents complained about the lack of sound control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alpha, one of the first computerized learning tools.
Now he's back there (hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a full head of question cards, which can be a car trip to an hour of instruction, with an expert with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child’s smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a quarty keyboard. However, the games included are not as teachable as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with the first major reprocessing of the Leapster series with a new, bright screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older tapes.
iXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses for games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to SD card work, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a strip of wood and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to combine the blocks with words before the time runs out. It is a great deal for an improvised book competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the games fields, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online time in the Penguin Club, for example a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will get enough credit for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
That can be roll shoes or a puffle stuff.
The newest head cell-operated microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The vessel moves fast to 12 vibrating silicone levels in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an iron gate.
And he's holding out something.
Ours fell from the kitchen and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police settings in China will be softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked through a city square, checked his nervous subjects, and gave him orders with military authority and a soft voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the city order, scared and despised for their volunteer races and their commitment to violence - to impress the visitors.
"Get up!"
"Look at you!"
"Shut them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls did not grow up to the teen age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and hosen.
Four pair of black pumps stood in just a row.
Four regular Heats are in perfect shape on the hair held with blue-white strands.
"They look mean to me," said Mr. Tang with appreciation.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to raise the image of China's urban inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a high school term.
The province of Guangdong instead of the Grains introduced a light blue uniform.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced violence by Dutch stars: in 2009 reports were reported by 50 officials who were not properly equipped with an impasse and started the operator until they arrived after a half hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city area in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, wants to make a major change in the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the city police force. They have been selected especially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a cold, feminine aspect.
However, it would hardly be possible for Scarlett Johansson to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of this city's command.
With the right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers can only apply the urban laws with money or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show another picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei tried to kill a viewer when they filmed a protest against a mobbed.
In the last year, a school manual of Peking's officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be tortured without blood transfusions.
In this year, a Shanghai watermeleon dealer experienced a wave of brain damage with five employees.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan fears the government," the national newspaper China Daily complained last year, after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "real basic soaping".
Sceptics have the current approach to clearly insufficient.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October through the announcement, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real jobs or should only serve as optical relaxation.
Probably both.
According to job announcements, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial hair".
They should be oversized - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment ratio ends with the achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women is too intense for women over 25 physically.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district official at the nearly government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial hair, etc."
Then there's temperature and "inherent qualities".
"The female Chengguan are like flowers," he said, adding, "but besides, they have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City Administration of the District, does not want this description to be mandatory,
However, it added that in China size standards are not impossible for both sexes.
The same applies to equal facial hair.
Whether to compare it with a good look is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical resolution do not need to compete.
"We can't use no lams or bucklings here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled at the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bucks and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel like sessististist that such a great value would be placed on her face.
"Can I look out in this uniform sexy?" she asks with ironic glance.
Her colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the city's image."
As a result, they do not regret the short-term approach because they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to throw down traders through the gas to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning the strip consists of about twelve street dealers trying to sell as many breads and pastries as possible before continuing.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you that so often!" explained Mrs. Xu, a dealer who was flying on foot and had recently left his naked kitchen on a wheelchair.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than demanding.
"It's almost the same every day," says Huang Jing, 20, who studied in free time.
"All Routine."
One reason is that female officers cannot confiscate the goods of the dealers, as their male colleagues do.
They can only drive criminals to report their men's actions.
This is to protect them from public assaults that are often exploited by officials in China.
In this year hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, had been randomized after the funeral, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured during the night accident, 14 government vehicles were repatriated or burned.
Xindu has been deprived of such violence.
However, disturbances are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officers patrolled this morning gathered over 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated an engine wheel that was repaired in a workshop instead of against the rules on the town wall.
The owner calls Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of driving, the officers walked on the road to their cars and continued on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the men's ranks, remained back. He turned his white name to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not meant to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we'll talk."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains below.
"Most of the time, the people started fighting."
State lawyer will not be accused of Senator Ensign
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign, have made excuses for the charges that, after his case with an ex-election assistant and his attempt to get her husband to have a lobby activity against him, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal case against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Until the scandal, the country-wide guard for battle lines and his career, he was considered a potential presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" after the one-year investigation.
However, the ethics committee of the Senate could still defer a disciplinary sentence.
According to Ensign's attorneys, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been conducted and that no further charges were made in this regard.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to be outside the case.
The trial was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your opinion was given sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were first opened in the New York Times in October 2009, gave permission to suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistant, slowed down his contracts to purchase his fault over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during an election campaign of Ensigns as a treasure teacher.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton's job. According to the documents and hearings, he took over for them after Hamptons Lobby's job.
As Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he had to do no lobbying for his former employer or the whole Senate for a year.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which was close to the case, was against the so-called ban on the right-to-be-of-the-law act.
According to the published index, "all seems to be about a discussion and about the loss of the lawn states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the protection of customers who are visiting the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to give reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical people said that the ministry seemed very cautious in the adoption of political complaints after a number of low-interested reports from the media, including the decision last year to let the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens fall because of the lack of state law.
Public prosecutors, Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the United States Parliament and Government rounds), said a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr Ensign before the court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now refrain from applying the laws for them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr Ensign, said in an interview, he had received a phone call from a state attorney on Monday and another the next day he was informed that the ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns had co-operated with the state attorneys to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins pointed out that the legal arguments he had made against the public prosecutors were more precise.
"I'm not sure that I'm going to go into the details of the debate between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much has been said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to submit the findings on the basis of a separate complaint by the ethics group following a payment of $96,000 from Mr Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The election commission said that it did not provide sufficient evidence that the money had been something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 suggests that, after the company passed on Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, had a message with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he had been arrested in the Ministry of the Interior for a case.
Mr. Ensign also opened a meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Alligiant Air, on Wednesday, and asked the Minister for Transport to agree to a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up for lobbying.
In the last year, for the first time, information on these events was made available to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and expressed his position in the Senate where he had been in the hands of the Republicans in the fourth place.
After he had not been up for months, Mr Ensign told two weeks ago that he wanted a third office time in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr Ensign would no longer be the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, expressed the hope that the ethics commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up its findings very quickly.
"Senitor Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call focuses on Twitter
Half a thousand of them fell into the Krawalds in the courthouse.
In the minutes, they sent out their reports on graphic testimony on Twitter.
At the end, such defense, there were more than 120,000 Twitter notifications about the process of rape and beatings children in a house that fell into flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the death warrant is dropped by the jury.
However, Mr Hayes' attorneys have already filed applications to the Court for grounds for a profession and the courts will be held for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through intensive reporting on the process, including through the extensive use of Twitter by media reporters, to a "circus atmosphere" and so wide that there has been an overhaul of disturbing details, so that the jury has been adversely affected by public equipment.
This claim could allow the Court of Appeal to deal with the question of whether new rules are needed in the Court of Justice.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is a real danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courthouse affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The President, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, showed last week that the applications were brief and kindly returned when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been subjected to torture.
But that was not the last word in this case.
For decades, court rulings have found that reporting on cases of reputation-enforced doubts can arise in the light of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the sentence against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that because of the new media, there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the court hall".
Some believe that the television series and the game film "On the flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers said that the court's claims that Mr Hayes' judgment had been considered half a century later might follow the argument that new rules had become necessary to regulate the communications routes from the courthouse that were still unprofessional in the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be alarmed about the influence of the new media in processes followed by a broad audience," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appellants might be fascinated by the idea that restricting a communication from the courthouse could make the process better.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who represent Mr Hayes' legal counsel to discuss for years and therefore extend a ruling.
The defenders also claimed, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have already been condemned, as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential juryes by showing them graphic tattoo photos during the jury election.
Some of the jury said, photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had been filled with abortion.
The defendants said that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge had falsely exchanged a jury that had been a critic of the government, and that he would have had an unacceptable pressure on the court if he had made the impossible decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a court hearing they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election fight for the government's office and for the American Senate by the candidates.
They argued that the new media had constantly re-encompassed the flame of emotions over the case.
"A daily alarm of the media, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyer writes, "there has been a long time ago in New Haven and perhaps not even in the country."
Your focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages would be more dangerous than reports that would be slowly replaced was a technically hostile view that would undermine reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellants would often be faced with the argument, and social and technical changes were necessary by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyer reinforces this claim.
In their statement, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's judgment was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media need new rules.
"This case," they write, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st Century."
Can Humidity Link the Distinction?
After a campaign on skiing words and negatives this week, little flexibility has been broken down in Washington.
Is it a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the battle of the parties in the capital?
On Tuesday, the meeting between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not interfere with the big issues with which one had to deal during the "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government, in which no decisions were taken.
After everything you hear, there was no formal discussion between two different sides or a view of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial assembly.
The public meeting of the Committee on Deficiency of the President on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist among the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that leads to the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is required, while trying to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-warning.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants was limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that would have prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November election of Washington was at least mild for a short time.
"No question has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after election.
Elections cause partial suffering that cease again.
And that's good."
In some matters, especially those on the agenda of the 'lame duck session', Republicans and Democrats hardly have a choice to find a solution."
Bush tax cuts at the end of the year, and no one's threatening that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
It is also a compromise with regard to increased unemployment, although only because the Republicans cannot afford it, that they believe that the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while the unemployed refuse to support them.
After meeting on the Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can ratify the new START contract in these matters during the "lame dock session" and at the same time.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the Lame duck session" does not have to lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-stop voting is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that must be done are done, this short-term psychology will be transformed into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this creation is shared by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's going on from today to 2012, as a front fight, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 event," he said.
The reasons for this are much to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty electors who were responsible for their education.
As the Republican leaders may also be concerned about high poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government expenditure and to put the health reform out of force.
These sections are already in the first reaction to the Commission's recommendations on deficits, which include a tax reform and the addition of certain taxes, as well as the accession of the pensioner and the reduction of state expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much pressure to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan for official recommendation and they fight very hard to get close to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the group, since in financial matters, at least today, there is only a few playing room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston says two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place in the form of joint meetings next year when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, the taxes and the health system, followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the participation of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation in a tank gas leads to what happened in 1995, both parties must pay attention to the public response.
Anyone who is always sentenced to loss will have to change the course and find the compromise.
This may actually be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than in his time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 see as a pure example for a wide-ranging selection of consequences 2012.
In this way, many Americans may be welcomed by the generosity that is taken into consideration this week.
However, it will require much more on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two into one another.
Secure US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control lies in the hands of the "kleptocratic" and it gives part of the deposit money and the protection money it collects on the Kremlin. Thus in February, the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service express high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every record of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin referred to as "vertical authority" - takes part in the money that the leader goes up.
The memo, sent under the name of the messenger John Beyrle to Washington, was published on WikiLeak's website on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was a mayor of Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was burned in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been raised in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a known construction company, have repeatedly referred for corruption over years, and has won numerous accusations against such charges.
In September he explained a Russian television transmitter when he was asked for a document suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's drunk, it's dirty."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That has raised questions.
But it is unusual that, as is the case in the messenger's report, individuals are named, and it is unheard of that happens by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Government of Moscow with crime has led some to refer to it as "damaged" and to conclude that the government is more like a crater than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which is also extended to the police, state security (FSB), the service surveillance authority (MVD) and the government office of the government as well as the entire government bureaucracy of Moscow.
Experts have discovered a threefold structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is the Captain Stella."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow the lowest level."
"This is an incompetence system in which criminal groups in some areas are failing because the city has no help."
The report further states that the FSB money is being spent by the largest companies and that the police arrest small business people.
A source, it says, "was stated that Moscow's business owner understood that it was best to obtain protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), since they have not only weapons, resources and power as criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason the protection of criminal gangs is no longer asked as earlier."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very clear; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - due to one condition or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time, he has noticed that he has made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men who were probably full of money in the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev must leave himself to the bureaucrats," said Georgiy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a division of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
In many countries, according to estimates, corruption in Russia costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is in place 154 of a new study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are listed by "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The reconnaissance of the memos of the American message, which took place in later weeks after Moscow, will certainly resolve cases within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's error, it may also be possible for the Kreml to claim that it is possible to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a falsification and responded to the suspicion that American diplomats named him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and so unethical and way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a low-light, double classroom with dirty and exciting walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it to the later Khmer Rouge Leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he felt sorry for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalisation of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term attachment to Anlong Veng is required.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face the public confrontation with the people who initially supported the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book, which tells the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, who had been sentenced to 35 years in prison by the former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng Volterroom, Kaing Khek Iev.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge Veteran Alnlong Vengs, and their efforts to reintegrate and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still aversion and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glory, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It's the family itself."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were executed or died from diseases, processing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese arrived in 1979 and the Pol Pot-Ied government broke down, the rest of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement was capitalised, restlessness.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok led the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN peace agreement promoted to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to pass on to the government what led to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not followed, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Darkrek Mountain.
He died in the Phnom Penh prison in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
When their teeth were no longer protected, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of the rural Cambodians, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they dropped their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, unimaginated farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitalisation," said Sok Long from the Center for Justice and Debt, which is located throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are rooted in the utopian agrarianology of the regime."
"They grow up without any knowledge of professions."
So Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in Dschungel about Anlang Beng before he died in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"To Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
In the beginning of the next year, the court will try to present Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
It is the duty of the Court to condemn the older leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the criminal acts, but it is not said whether further action is being taken on these four cases.
This has helped a little to calm the worst in Anlong veng.
Current media speculations have concentrated on the Chaem, 64 years old, which had been in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told officials from the documentation center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot night, the Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the lost grass it was slowed down in the Chaem to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had asked her, she would have refused to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"No more persecution, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also warned again that the situation would be uncertain, even though experts and historians would discuss this.
"Cambodia must bury a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Resurrection with the Khmer Times means a combination of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything."
The centre created the first approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often as in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family has many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people are judged by the court."
Such resistance makes the disintegration process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court come after and after influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dark Mountains leads one of the superseded and plastic-dried roads to a rectangle of black roses, covered with a red glow.
Paul Pots Body was burned here after his death in 1998 at a railway station.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a telephone vendor on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots last restroom where she was going to hit a bus bringing bananas - hoping he would make her happy.
Belarus is agreed not to collect further armed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign on global nuclear security, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that no longer will be collecting a highly equipped uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint state after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security case.
The US government had tried to convince Belarus for years to collect no longer enough uranium and seemed to have achieved a harvest last spring.
However, U.S. government officials told Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Swiss research agency.
This prepared the stage for the convention on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the topic.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's Nuclear Safety Summit of 47 Nations since April, which had been concluded by Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear safety shelter (2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Lugo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all pre-nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
A thousand countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Safety Summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high-qualified uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is essentially armed, and less-adhesive uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"That's our raw material... we're not gonna make any dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus approached the United States when it showed interest in a meeting of the agreement.
The first attempt to remove the Uranus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily depleted, said officials.
It was sent to a special train, which has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal plant for, says officials.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was conducted by air officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these coins, where a large part of the money flows into the White Russian research with a weakly equipped uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and agreed to build confidence", led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniewski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated that in this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium as well as hundreds of pounds of highly armed uranium.
In line with the common agreement, Belarus intends to terminate its storage until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States had been heated for years, firstly because of Lukashenko's grave human rights abuse.
But the state from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, as the United States of America and Belarus recognises that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says.
No objection from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory after Guantánamo, as reported by a U.S.A. messenger telegram in Madrid.
This reflects the documents submitted by Wikileaks and the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former Deputy Head of Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish government be informed "to ensure that foreign aircraft flying Spain be properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid to human rights practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was accused, the former North American messenger Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega were interviewed.
The Deputy Head of Government said that the report of the Council "had Zapatero taken away" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega under stress, Spain has no objection to the secret service flights across the Spanish state area."
"They just want to be informed," says Aguirre per cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the messenger that the Spanish Government "does not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence since it is in the hands of the judges."
On the other hand, the government lawyer Vicente González explained in January 2007 that he would not block the legal initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burden or sensitive information," the messenger explained after a conversation with the state attorney.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the "problem coordination between the Spanish Government and the German Government" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will be complicated by our efforts to deal with discrepancies between governments," Aguire laments.
On a Wednesday in March 2007, when the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba commented that "although the Spanish judges were constantly scrutinizing their independence and doing what they considered appropriate," he gave his staff instructions "to avoid excessive rhetorical comments in order to reduce tension."
The messenger also expressed his concern about the way the PP acted in this regard.
"In spite of their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt this, as a sign that the Government of Zapateros can be exposed to, tolerated or ignored as possible human rights violations, capital will be hit, even if these findings could have a negative impact on the US government," he said.

In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is very self-sufficient and expensive because I have come to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to send the boys to you."
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boys with my mother, I'll take him away when I get back."
In May, she says from the return to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because I have to introduce myself to work on 20th if I don't want to lose."
She explains that she takes her first child when everything's going well.
"He will be with the one whom he must be, that is with me. I will not let him live with anyone other than my mother," a doubtful idea if you consider their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is said that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was killed on the 10th is dead.
"To the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, not to the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She speaks from a shift to Mallorca.
"There he (the young man) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
At 17: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of Caesar who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, like, a mistake."
On the 30th, he said, "The boy's going well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there's one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from you.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison camp".
"Terror a la galley (overscript) ".
The last man who spent his life with her, a convicted hunting officer, explains to have consciences because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a lonely mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Center for Prisoners to Menorca in the province of Palma.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that they could not remember the execution of the case, "and they did not have the intention to add the small damage."
Before that, however, she had been drinking Caesar in the bathroom and had to hide his body in a suitcase.
Defence and state government called for a psychiatric attitude.
Partido Popular won 4 sessions in Congress and lost PSC 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and abstentions in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on Parliamentary elections - whether or not. Their expectations are more positive than they are, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is normally double as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 voted.
If this rising trend - the result of the re-enactment of the PSC vote and the binding of the PP election, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congressarians in parliamentary elections, while the CIU would also win four (now 10) and lose at least 9 Members (from 25) of the PSC.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a decommissioning network - at present it has three - while the ICV could hold or win one.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next term will fall with the elections in May 2011. The People's Party (PP) may also be on the watch to prepare the socialist leadership for an end, namely in four provincial cities and with most of them in Barcelona City, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists are not able to reach a majority or return to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debate, it is not unreasonable for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona Community, where it had to reach 5% of the votes.
The PP listed an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that the main trolleys in Tarragonas can be played around. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
A Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Angel Ross, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election battle, they met several times.
Even in other important places, such as Badalona, Castell defels or Reus, the people's party was able to mark a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia, and the formation of lists in as many places as possible.
Al Qaida was concerned about thousands of passengers
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers of the Barcelonas police station, arrested by Pakistani and Nigerians, formed the dschyhadist cells controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Move for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - later the author of the bombings, who requested 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister shows the importance of these investigations, which goes so far as to ensure that with the "Operation Campai" the Falsting Device Al Qaidas has become "weak" worldwide and "with their ability to act".
Researchers point out that in the two years in which the cells in Catalonia were active, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they fell and then to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was formed, so that their "wars" could pass beyond the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only dschyhadist network active in Europe, which is why other European police units have also been involved in research in addition to the Thai research bodies, and it is not surprising that there will be similar alerts in the EU's area in the next days, such as the one carried out in Barcelona on the last day of service.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistaner Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) was arrested in Thailand, where Pakistaner Muhammad Athhar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikallaya Kijbumung were arrested.
They were led by Bangkok from the cells below in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of which was lost in 2009 - was particularly silent on tourist paths according to the standards of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 and were still valid for several years; they were not required to show a visa stamp.
In the investigation rounds, it is underlined that so far no links could be established between those established in Catalonia and the alert in Bombay, although the author of this alert, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the group of recipients who were stolen in Spain and in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before the assassination of Catholics from a cash transfer company, several thousand dollars were sent, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", prepared for the life of 106 people.
The police have made extensive documentation available.
PP requires Mas to cancel the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present to him their terms of support for his office as President of the Generality, who are not different from the former president of the General Assembly during the election struggle and are able to combine with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independenceists, such as a financial equality agreement that the regionalist leader wishes to propose at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to the safety of Artur Mas, who had won the 18 members on the last Sunday - a figure which is more than enough to feel unforgettable. As the candidate from the civil-regional party CIU is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is involved in voting at his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections at the Congress depend on a possible understanding with the PP.
With regard to the PPC, it calls for the support of the Office to "all talks concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - as in the Basque country - and even a referendum by the CIU Party.
Both political leaders are common to make the established political apparatus of the regional administration easier and want to remove the taxes on inheritance and gift.
With the details of the negotiations on the entry into force of Mass, the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolor's Montserrat are on the other side.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a strong opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The age-care authority confirms that deaths are not returned to "missing measures"
The owners of the old home in Olot do not conclude that her guardian killed over 11 older people
Yesterday a press conference in Olot (Gerona), in which the officials of La Caritat's old-fashioned Homeland, presented the damages to the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmés - the guardian who had killed at least eleven people responsible for his work - added to the institution.
The head of the elders, Joan Sala, in conjunction with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, spoke before the court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the right and our liability force us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only take a loss of social vision because it did not determine the criminal actions of the debtor in due time, but also pay a high amount of compensation now calculated by the legal representatives of the victim's family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé found that the first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he had continued to kill.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he argued that no doctor had personally examined the dead, but that the formalities had been developed by telephone because of their age and disease.
The leader of La Caritat took this point along the way and explained that "permanent measures could never have been the reason for the events."
The Lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the law that a person other than the accused shall be given in the law."
He had already been baptized as a "deadbed" before 11 murders and declared that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and that within a month, the second old lady had been killed.
In this case, he died with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first offence in which he had mixed a mixture of various remedies.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to the medications is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the solvent cocktail were used by the nurse in six of nine cases to release the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will be revealed whether Vila lied and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or if he burned it from inside by dissipating them, as he had done in the case of three women, who he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat there is no belief in the pleas of the debtor, not even in the number of the alleged murders that could be too much. This is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it would not make sense to change his actions after eight successful murders.
They say that they are based on this reason and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
Trawls of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors reacted yesterday to the pressure of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our reaction potential."
The risk estimates of the euro periphery countries have been dramatically increased and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can shut itself down and that the euro has not given rise to any concerns.
The events of yesterday are typically for an illiquid market, which is to the extent that it is repeated, however due to the closure of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional agent will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, where the ECB will have to make a return tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and perhaps a few more times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the closure of the plan for the purchase of State debt, as they were ineffective, as well as the suspension of all exceptionally-fashioned liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the four-year statements with unlimited access to the fourth quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June will be maintained.
We also expect the programme to continue to purchase obligations and to issue a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will come back from yesterday and if we are strongly forced to return our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that it would not take into account the purchase of State debt securities and that the markets would collapse in the future, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and necessary.
In May, she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot of money that brought about a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's title in Portugal was quite weak.
The government managed only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fall at 30 base points throughout the curve and thus reflect a change in the market according to the words Trichets.
In Ireland the figures of the debt debt of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10,000 million short-term and possibly 15 000 more. There is time until February to create private capital or these banks will be made public.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not know the problem with the stress test in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the Government must receive parliamentary consent to its new budget plan, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel designed her speech in view of the summit of the Head of State and Government on 14 December. There was a political unit asked to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the nine sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, development of state deficits, liberalisation, privatization and labour protection measures, measures that are heard in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish beer has reached 4.5 percent, doubles as much as the rest of the European beers.
Compared to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year state loan that will take advantage of the Trichet effect. Therefore, we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt capacity.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be a self-sustainment.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The stock has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are too expensive and the access to the markets would be free of charge.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the Motto César's wife: "Now it is not only the being but also the shadow."
Just be quiet, we'll make it!
The President of Eulen shall, at the request of his children, hold the Society Assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not cease.
David Álvarez, the founder of the company, will be affected by the company assembly of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, because he holds them "no matter" for absolutely nothing. His children will try to get a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Weinguts Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his children, Jesus David and María José, prepare the legal measures for a new chapter in their dispute to control a part of the group.
The reason for the greatest maintenance of business services does not seem to be ready to monitor the control of El Enebro's organs in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Administrative Board by five of his seven children, who were appointed to the Administrative Board members at the Administrative Council meeting of 18 January this year, which is already registered in the Trade Register.
The El Enebro Society Assembly, which was convened by Judge No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has dissolved a new Donnerschlag in the stock of the Álvarez family.
The call by the Director for the promotion of the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the inclusion of the assembly.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be interpreted by David Álvarez as a "decided means of the applicant - his five children - in order to be recognised by legal dignitaries, frauds and abuses of law for a non-explained assembly on 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the adoption of the assembly in the neighbourhood in order to explain it as "so far as it is not necessary".
The same protagonists who stumble indiscrete weaknesses have tried successfully in June to appeal to an assembly in a just way.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicily, besides other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
In spite of this, the service group's leaders claim that family protocols require the right to use 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the case that the judge in the hearing has to decide on handling the application for which no date has been established.
Red Bull sees in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
Cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004 entered the world of Formula 1, her story has been recorded in this published universe of speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave the Newling observation and despite his sleigh-up performance during the last season, all on the final November of Fernando Alonso's Ferraris victory.
Without the ability of the German pilots and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the renault engine, the "heavy weapon" was put in the hands of the many Siemens Red Bull and thus created a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful tool to simulate processes that the German company carried out in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with autorents.
This computer program, called PLM, was used for the development of Montenegrins in factories around the world, energy tools and high precision instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid such errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous utility vehicles.
Sigfried Russwurm, director of Siemens' Industry Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Fabrik Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that will be made on the race and on the test.
Russwurm suggests that in 1992, average ten technicians were employed in the run-offs, which could introduce three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bulls team, 180 high-quality young people are employed today. With powerful EDV systems, they conduct analyses and all possible changes to the race cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software could be able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred through progressive production facilities and high-tech cars within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend in a season.
Red Bull has built his hightech factory for the development and manufacture of his race car in a 50 km away from London.
It is about two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that's going on there is Top Secret.
The crew includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the World Master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls is true formula 1 - Hell is certainly the newest world master Sebastian Vetell.
Other protagonists, whose support is priceless and their reputation is zero, are behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer places in the service of its participation in the race.
The technical head of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the field of F&E for race cars was contributing 50 percent to victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology makes 85% of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15%.
Nevey admits that vettel and webber can never be replaced by EDV because they "are not predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty-two own countries in two years with local distributors
Hewlett Packard (HP) left his first exclusive load in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of the twenty-business sales network with 80 to 100 square meters each, which aims to open the Multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-market industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-Presidents of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned for example the built-in cargo at the Grand Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, worked with the HP for thirty years.
The North American Company Group aims to establish 200 shops in Europe by 2010, of which 20 discounts are available in Spain.
The first weeks were spent in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr Herrera did not want to tell the next openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice-President, who is also the leader of HP Personal Systems, ensured that the philosophy for opening up is always the same. It supports a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American Company Group tells about this and takes over the exclusive charging equipment (with interactive products to capture). All countries in Europe will look alike.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the loading staff.
Helena Herrero said that it did not deal with a franchising system and stressed that with the exclusive sales network, "the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing and then even optimising the packages."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantees.
An online service builds a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, as the large companies have already completed their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herro explained yesterday.
Sababell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'klauen'
The executive member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first, a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he sees a rise in interest rates that the banks are trying to compare with increases in the fees and prices for loans.
Sababell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - a new job.
Sababell has found the way out for the next three years, and so to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000 if the customers who lose the bank - are left to grow. This is the big challenge facing this bank, as it has so far devoted its business customers more attention than its private customers.
In this year it has access to 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Your market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers make up more than 10 per cent.
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks are trying to set and publish in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has brought together all the banks' plans to one another worldwide.
Sababell will conclude its four-year-old guide plan, which was originally issued for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended to a business year.
The customers who left the savings are the main target of the bank.
In an early morning organized by the APIE, Guardiola, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with great wealth".
The manager goes out of it, Spain just came out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if it appears that the fight against Passiva - which penalizes the profit margins - is to be lifted, the risk claims that banks and savings will have to be paid for their emissions for liquidity will have to be compared to fast profits already at the price of credit.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will be printed on credit."
"We haven't turned the hair off, but the interest differences are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto had already arranged for its branch network to limit the payment of long-term loans and increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the rule of law, "to raise the fees", but "under a competitive framework".
Sababell's lead plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It does not, however, ensure that in Spain "greater companies are needed."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is now "absolutely rising" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions are breaking up in red numbers.
It is the opinion that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of a loss of capital.
After ensuring that Sababell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he echoed the argument of a banker who has already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put in place, but in contrast to the events in June, short-term funding could be obtained on mortgages and thus the crisis would end.
The CECA excludes a second fusion shell of the spartacus
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, sought yesterday the possibility that it might come to a fusion wave of cracks and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish spartacus began, several spartancies were not involved in the first phase. They were held in front of the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, would not take place in the second round.
"I believe that most of the mergers are closed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was much more about adaptations."
"The largest part is closed. It may be that we have instead of seventy-seven or fourteen, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
In an early morning organised by the business leader and manager Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta pointed out that the concentration process "has been completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely run, which in times past has not been established within the framework of the business plan with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically uncomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much larger than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta explained that "there are a number of unexploded opinions about the length of the process, the seriousness and insensibility" because "Banco de España urges us to close the deadlines before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the ECCA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most powerful financial systems in Europe and perhaps the whole world, and added that those who doubt this "without further knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic context, we need to make "no concern" about the position of financial institutions and savings that have undergone a "very important" concentration process, which will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very good records of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro but at the same time set conditions for the European Union as a whole.
The market tensions have doubled the Government's response.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, initiated by tax assessments for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of temporary enterprises or suspension of EUR 426 unemployment support, which does not relate to unemployment, up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 per cent of the state lotteries.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It would have been assumed that the brand's position is no mistake in its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the euro's refinance.
Germany therefore introduces a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of traditional traditions of a large part of its partner.
In view of the opposition in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
First: a stronger euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries had to leave the euro area during the South.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it is currently listening to science fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirdly: a reorganisation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budget management; sanctions of countries that exceed the standards; possibly setting up certain countries as well as extending the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawing from time to time. That is why there is no reason now.
First, in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission launched challenges and the German Government launched a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the cooperation between Germany and its partners, including France, between what was necessary for Germany (strong tax plans and stable public finances).
The second sign set the Central European country, as a mark, the decision to save Greece was painful.
It was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and public opinion were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October, Markel comes out to New with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union Agreement to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time obliges private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was explained as an anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and all the following.
However, its proposal, even if something is missing, has been adopted, and we will be involved in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think too much of it.
It is said to all that - even if unfavourable measures must be taken now - it will no longer be given the old functioning of the euro.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area in which the neighbouring countries are severely punished, which may be forced to declare themselves able to pay, and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to engage in a strong growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption reduction, productivity improvement and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances.
The other alternatives, based on an apology and construction with huge losses in the balance of payments, as they were introduced by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken into account.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about lowering the state deficit by three per cent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we can do under these conditions is to blame ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass into more peace.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after discussion with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Markel, the mortgage, ordering in his own house, has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
In view of the possibilities we have to leave the euro area completely closed with little serious countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regularity
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game show the invention spirit against the Ajax, but not the will to take a penalty.
The resulting exclusion of two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the League champions led to the loss of many inks of whether or not it was an unsportable act and whether or not both players should be penalised by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the gameland (their team had already gained clear time) and played several fouls so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid group would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanctions at the next league against the Auxerre and thus increase without cards in the next game phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee condemned the trainer of the Club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often encountered in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this kind of sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who presented in his Hymne edelmut and honor and at other times punished his players for similar events) played the main role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, which has added an episode to his long history as a theatre and procuring technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether these behaviors, not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, are contrary to the principles of sport, namely whether these actions constitute a regular approach. In fact, these practices refer to the statutes of sport, but seem to reflect their meaning.
In this regard, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical inconsistencies of the opponent, a aspect that has not been threatened by these actions, because it was not aggressive.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the abusers taking unfair advantage of the team. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the behavior of the real Madrid player is that it does not match what we normally understand under false game or rule, because the context of the rule has not been secretly completed to avoid a penalty, but should be as casual as possible so that it is punished by the judge.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage should the dealers draw from the intentional foul.
Here it should be noted that the rival was not put in a more unpleasant position or benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not then have this player.
The advantage is clearly that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could endanger their participation in a future game.
But it is about a long-term, up to a certain degree unknown, since the team could at one time also differ. Furthermore, the players receive a penalty in this manner and go through the second round of cards, where they divide by card usage with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether it is really a benefit.
Finally, such actions are not directed against the sport spirit, which includes strategic decisions to derive the greatest benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to make any sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of regularity), they wanted to choose more if they would submit to it.
They have taken a strategic decision without any punishment or to fly before them.
Although the gap between the acquisition and the settlement is uncertain, I believe that this is a clear case of the acquisition.
I have the impression that the policing was created by two factors: because it went about two self-conclusions and because of the nature of the persecution.
The damage that has been added to the principles of sport through these actions is less ethical than much more aesthetic.
Adebotoffensive for customer reception for group holiday guests in Barcelona
This year's calendar dictatorship may fall on a number of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turón and the Christmas lottery, there are also groups of guests and leisure companies in Barcelona. However, due to the economic crisis, they solve a price-frequency problem in order to also capture the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a dinner or dinner, confirming the entrepreneurs and associations concerned.
In order to make the booking a little more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) has all orders fell on the week of December 13 with the result of a two-day reservation of evenings (of 16 and 17) and almost no orders on the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up the group budgets for budgetary reasons.
In order not to ignore this tradition, many workers pay these from their own pockets.
As the conjuncture is always required, low prices are required, confirmed by the president of the guest camp in Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the board of directors is not waiting to see how the holidays will be viewed this month.
"The people pass it 'zig time before they book it."
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he stressed.
The business will go to those who will "supply the quality of good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls on us to remember that customers are saving in times of crisis, so prices are asked at the highest price of 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it is clear that on the evening of 17 December, the offerers will be brought to the collapsants.
The Soteras Group says that the applications for this Friday with a view to spending less than 30 euros would be grown. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers of €25 to €35 to the conjugation facility.
In another leading group, Andylana, which holds 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), has conducted the property of the calendar to be reserved from the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With the AN group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 locals as a whole, optimism is not lost after the second quarter of the incomes are resuscitated and good, even if only a few days of concentrated views for the Christmas business are opposed.
The sources of the company group suggest that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more as a price. It has been shown that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details, for example, Cava.
In some companies it is also seen that there are green spores, which is why employees are invited back. This explains the impression that the groups are back in the wake.
Vensesites of the Facasarm roof (with combinations such as Barcelona's knife, restaurant and leisure connection), the deputy president, Henri Gomá, is confident to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are "lived" in total, although the customers are "extended a maximum".
However, the pleasure of the festival did not go back, regardless of who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad presents nuclear weapons here "faster than any other country".
Wikileak's findings confirm the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American message in Pakistan and the US Department of State, which is the main concern of the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington, is confirmed by the Internet portal Wikileaks.
Along the lines of clear and fair details that provide documents on the content of the talks and the reflections of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they imply that cooperation between the two countries in matters is not strengthened in terms of atomic security, but rather "takes" and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that weapons are not combined, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction difficult when it is possible to be destroyed - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the messenger in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The approach of some nuclear installations to the region affected by the Taliban, the possible expansion of nuclear material and the occurrence of transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear weapons and missile programmes is no longer considered by the United States, but also by Russia as the cause of violence.
"Pakistan has to set up strict staff of faith to monitor the nuclear installations; thanks to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or rocket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New documentation from Julian Assanges Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in matters of nuclear proliferation and the growing pace in Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster in Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson invites Washington during a visit of the Supreme Leader General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear up the responsibility" that "Pakistan Army has to introduce its infamous support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new flooding.
Interpol gives a red warning for the prosecution and detection of Assange.
Everything associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts are only hard to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "rote warning" for the "recovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for adoption.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia must put itself in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authorities with seating in Lyon (France) requested Sweden's order, but it was not known to the Swedish authorities until yesterday after obtaining power.
The 188 Interpol countries are directed to identify and find assange, "to identify and deliver it in advance."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the organisation's statement that the red alert must be free of arrest - which has to be carried out by the national police - particularly if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England where Assange is likely to be held.
Assangese lawyers who had recently published a letter informing them that Wikileaks' 39-year-old reasons are ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities at a video conference.
They also recall that Assange has requested the exits from Sweden and is compared with the state-owned Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the safety officer of Stalin, who received the relevant authorisation.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," is charged in writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia, because of her son's innocence - Assange is standing in an unknown place, yet not moving.
On Monday he gave the leader of the magazine Time per Skype from an unknown place from an interview. At the interview, he called for the return of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and therefore had failed to enter into an international agreement signed by the United States," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who referred to the application for return as "light and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN sender.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documentation distortions.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's speaker to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views of conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The President of the Congress, Peter King, who has been taking the chair of the National Security Committee of the House of Members since January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to take over their money and to anyone who supports them or supports them."
Tom Flaangan, Canadian President Stephen Harper's adviser, was still gone, and he had to reject his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target ship and an unmanned aircraft or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"If it has always been the one who has provided information in the government, he is responsible for the contract and everything that is not directed is a very mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC.
The Republican leader shall allow the Party to make a secret vote on its continuing stay in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the road for the last time of an internal revolt in the series of 11 votes after the loss of 11 votes and half of the voter votes.
The president is aware that his withdrawal threat does not satisfy the immediate presence of former party leader Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor himself and will not protect him from the same headaches as other previous flows.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with an eyebrow, which would ensure his position to the next municipal elections.
At first, it was announced that over 200 regional members of the ERC could be kept secret about their stay in the office.
With picklists, not with raised hand.
If the charodists wanted to pass on a list of punishments to the president, they could do so without fear of repression.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of sectarianism and of subjugation under his own person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel half the votes plus one who was not confirmed, and he added without adding percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod's neighbors ask the president more than the party to make his office available. An insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to make a return, they will agree with the Board on a plan of action from now until May.
They expect to be able to influence the preparation of the strategic immunization document, which will lead to the Council's vote on 18th.
Its purpose is to build Puigcercós. In contrast, this is to promise to present the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what the party tips already hold for a fact.
The president of the ERC is the view that the "polyphony" is damaging stability and he is trying to bring the organization into the process to wash their dirty washes behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which was signed by the official consul Joseph Huguet in his blog, is sympathetic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideology, the holder of Innovacción held it for a fact that the president of the party "in exchange for various objectives".
He numbered five of them in advance.
Firstly, the "instruction" of the board, so that at least 90 per cent of the members of the party are involved in the involvement of new faces from Cardos Environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finalise the principle of full assembly as a function.
In this way, he advocates a reform of the statutes that enables the Congress to be held with selected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which has already fought for it at the last two conventions.
In fact, at the 2008 Second Meeting, the Party was assigned to review the principle of full assembly at a conference to be held with the reform of the Statutes.
This is still the case, since it was not advisable to report this matter in the last year's internal appeal.
Now, without the critical sectors on the market, the time could have come for this to be resumed and to be concluded forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated on COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon trace and would maintain its offer to build 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
During his first public event at the 16th World Cup of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei, his country, had made enormous efforts to re-establish the carbon trace and convert its industry.
He pointed out that his country has invested $245 million in the last four years to capture the emissions of greenhouse gases.
However, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community in this regard.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all respects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, which contained the objectives for the re-establishment of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the Federal States had worked with the Central State and the Communities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, the effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he pointed out that a number of multiannual plans have already been taken or concluded, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those received money from other countries.
For example, he worked on the energy-efficient programme that was introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
It is also running a project at provincial level to climate change, a further exchange of traditional glaciers through energy savings and a further reduction and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser to climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far more widely accepted as a community.
He pointed out that the pro-head emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tons per person, while it was 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent in the last five years and will take place by 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party president had the right to refer to the National Order Commission and to ask what the right was to do to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN president had the right to refer to the National Organisation Commission and to ask what the right would give him.
In an interview conducted before the complainant, Gabino Cué Monteaguados as governor of the state, he explained that Espinos was a decision that had been taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Committee on Rules of Procedure in Sonora."
" Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Rúsional to make a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not to be considered at the time of 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never been established in the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Akção National was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, at which his successor will be elected.
"The (a Alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the Community election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we do not lose internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best president or the National Action for the next three years, and therefore he would pass over the Staff "to those who would decide for the Council."
"I'm so worried and open, I'd be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the president of the party."
He predicted that the rise of the party, recorded at the last elections of 4 July, would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is going to support Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that formed alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the prisoners and observe them throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and aspirations will be put in them and I am sure that Gabino is on the highest level of requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his speech within his four-year government, César Nava called on the MPI to consider the six-year period of the former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come from the forest," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the Federal Government expressed the way he could do in his speech in the National Auditorio, because in this country there is no prohibition of mouth and even less a accent.
Obama joins in Twitter for law-enforcement of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - then your senators call and press on the adoption of this Act," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and press on the adoption of this Act," Obama tweeted.
Its brief communication contains a cyberlink to a wide-ranging document which requires the public to contact its senators, as the voting of the law is taking place immediately.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stressed.
The message was spread, after the 42 Republican senators called on to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of the tax arrangements from Bush's times and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he was confident that if the tax issue had been resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax procedure must be developed before the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at any time and then we can plan the rest of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "the vote at the end of the debate would be requested" so that the Dream Act, with which the initiative to legislate undocumented students, could be agreed on the next Thursday in the Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the law of the American Dream would legislate about 800 000 young people who had emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in that country for the last five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the legislators need to vote in favour of the sixteen votes, because they are directed to the votes of a number of Republicans. At the time, the organizations of the sponsors of this project have an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have more than 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defences of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats should decide to return the initiative.
Most of the Republicans who were recruited belong to Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they state that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act is in the Senate before the greatest obstacles.
With literature put the finger in the corner
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a step of space, where participants made themselves strong for the story.
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wonder? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la langua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and used the title of her question at this time (on another occasion the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the cave... "brings us to difficulties", the Argentine writer said to the audience, mainly composed of young people gathered at the International Book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this moderate round table of Marisol Shultz, at Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she gave to Gonzalo Celorio, and then she identified the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what a "winde" is, and comes from a doctor who does not answer, but gives guidance for the guidance of her story.
Infectologists leave her convinced: "Tolerance is not my strength, maybe it's my miracle."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who threw her breath in the middle of the stage, and who explained that the ghost is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalytics include the secret: "The monster is really the open, the symbolic is the narcissist."
The main figure of the story makes it easy and concludes that "it's only the miracle that it's really open and it doesn't exist" but it's convinced that the fun in the language and its events are changing.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating story that he called 'the praise of discovery', which does not mention the finger in the wonder, but is discovered.
He told stories of a famous magician who had touched the clouds, brought back the angry men, or who had lost a girl again. The story made a repetition and reported from America, the great Roman who was not at first missing from his own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the passage of the stories told by the Europeans.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers) to meet the expected witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with educational power that even caused the feeling of shame."
However, he goes on to say, "if there are the crazy and liars who best imagine things", and there is reality and lies about each other, where one no longer knows the side of the story where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have called to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the film had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wonder'.
The Cubans and Puerto Ricans devoted their contribution to the great miracle of social violence, which their country commands - as a whole Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a steady, not pre-planned engagement," she explained after she had highlighted that literature is communication and binding which builds itself between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "the finger of the engaged writer in the wonder of the writer" above.
He noted that in a fast-lived world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness are also passed on to dogmatism, and will be forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a small no, and behind every experience a small yes."
"In order to have our thoughts and to be reality, we must encourage: And nuances are often important to put the fingers in the wounds and to punish those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, black and white, in pre-renewed ideas without innovation, and also to persuade the authorities who prefer to share the world in black and white, and then smile over the meaning of the writing.
Romano fought for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three lows in final games, he has experienced up and down in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles of their respective trainings, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three lows in final games, he has experienced up and down in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and he has kept himself well, why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has raised himself with the medal to the second champion, he is a step behind the winners, and he has miraculously spent the same team with the same team of finals.
The Santista strategist achieved the first game as a trainer at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', as Del Morelia had the bikes in his hand, with which he experienced a great fall against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive doll, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to hide again because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play was different, but at the Elfmeter he went forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to sign his title, but finally three of his players ordered the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two games with the Devil Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the accident and free himself from the evil magician to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he affirms that the game is the most important for him.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, it's for a club, for my engagement, and that's why the title will come to me, but what's happening earlier is the most important," commented the tax man when he was asked about the lost games.
The last game is still strong in his mind, he assures him, much to learn from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the judge doesn't finish, we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, too, because the last time we were already prepared for it with two elephants, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is over, there's no way to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elfmeter shooters, he doesn't disappoint him because he trusts his players: "I never want to get to the elfmeter shot, you want to finish in the regular game, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, we were prepared in the previous tournament, but unfortunately we were prepared for a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or strong effort, to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this game, and we hope that this time will not come to it."
It is in Romanso Power, not only to be a second champion and to spend the first time with the title.
The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation at the consulate at the service points for visa application; the costs will be so reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States' message and in the consulate shall be amended.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their conversation in the consulate at the service points for visa applications (ASC, the original English letters).
The staff of the ASC shall take into account the biometric data of the applicant examined by the consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the roll-out of the visa are reduced, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the language of the visa application, the processing of the visa application and the transport service to which the document is issued.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the present value of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for Visa with an application (including Visa for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who want to only extend their vision must not engage in conversation in the consulate, they must only present themselves at the next ASC where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As biometric data are stored in the ASC, the applicants who need a second term for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the 26-dollar service fee.
Further information on the new visa application procedure is available on the following website: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the fund of foreign life
The North American Space Agency introduced a press conference to propose a fund tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for life in all.
The National Air and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States gives an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA in Washington, Washington, U.S.A., at 13 p.m. on a press conference of experts in astronomy. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a transparent fund for the search for foreign life", which would solve speculations with experts from other countries.
The discovery could explain the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that you have previously held to be unalterable, human creations. The hypothesis has been raised that they could change into intelligent beings - as humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that has been kept too toxic for all forms of life on earth, since the sea is highly arsenic.
In some ways, the microbe uses the arsenic as a resource for survival. In view of this ability, the chances that other planets that do not have a protective atmosphere could give similar lives.
When these organisms change their drugs, it is shown by astronomers that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from that of us."
At the press conference tomorrow, the space travel agency will be aware of the real wealth of its funds.
At the conference, the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on March, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Rules of Procedure on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they will regret it.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block had already been installed, introduced by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who represented themselves as independent. The following four questions were raised: the introduction of the 'Two-party system' into the chamber.
Prior to the introduction of the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo fought against the reform of the system, as they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, they continued to introduce a 'double-party system' because now there would be two persons, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Vice-Presidents Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political orientation with these reforms.
He said that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and they went out of their political will, and if they had not, they would have been re-submitted by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until I come here (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patron and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after he was monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that will rule a two-party system at Congress."
"This group starts with five members at the beginning and they talk with other colleagues and colleagues to make it more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led in a play on PAN and PRI that the convention has now turned into a 'house' for two.
"Before, it was just a party, now they share this together to the second."
Patrón Montalvo asked the members to respect them and to give them their place in the negotiations.
"It must not be put out because of the top five decisions, which are likely to be nine members, but the five which are now seen as being divided into different groups have decided to agree to enter into the negotiation process, because because of the reform carried out by the others, we remain outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check on the conflicting owner of the company for electromaterials.
A further check of more than 200,000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means the sum paid to the owner of the company for electricity in the second half of the year is 1,200 000 pesos.
According to the website for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso issued with number 9258447 on last 16 November, with the use of the "Calculation of Open Accounts".
Mr. Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would go from the community to these suppliers. She will be watched by the Auditiaa Superior del Estado because she sells too much prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum that you still owe and thus the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought at her, it's just the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last check was "baptized" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of October 15, 19 October, 29 October and last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when an ASE company is asked to avoid other administrations from applying for its services, the Chief of Staff assured that their services would not be re-appropriated.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published the examination of the records issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that by March 2008 until 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez had paid the community more than 10 million pesos with 42 Czechs to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam where they took over 3 million peso in value.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the loss of foreign tourists due to the bad situation of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the storm of a foreign tourist into the entrance of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán called on the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas in which they are in a bad condition and to cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Dorada Trade Union, recalled that it was called for different opportunities to pursue the travel goal and to turn the bad conditions the tourists are facing into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and roads had been adversely affected, as the tourists came to their senses and saw the regulation, where they would use the nearby countries to return.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you spend, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work this way easily and purposely."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's storm had made the city’s side of the city’s lack of prevention and maintenance work more noticeable.
"The community has to assume its responsibility and avoid doing something like this again. How should it do? Now, instead of taking preventive precautions to improve everything in the neighborhood," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean living room. The city administration must change its strategy in order to get the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that are also unattended and unprofessional," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to call tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and tourist attractions always in sight," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of events are the only thing that is obvious for all: a maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Turística, pointed out how important it is to save the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they would not use properly and let a bad picture develop.
He mentioned a number of places that were to be brought to the city along with the city. The city was to be designed clean, orderly and attractive for foreign transport.
"Mazatlán, fortunately, offers many historical and cultural cities that have to be cleaned up and cleaned first in order to make them attractive for foreign transport and to lead them to the inventory we are using for this purpose.
IP required results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that the members should assume the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which is faced with many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán calls for a strong Parliament, free of debate between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is angry and faces great problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was enlarged. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 MPI members, 13 PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alliancea, two of PPDs, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. This is a total of 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, feel obliged by society and different social groups, which are assigned to a responsible parliamentary work, and do not repeat the same patterns of participation and patriotism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Board, suggested that the new members should assume the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which is faced with many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will actually exercise their right to conduct free talks between the parties, because it is common for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, in which they become partners in Carnival of the Government and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they perform a reliable work and put their trust in the society and their groups in front of everything, because they were the people of Sinaloa who spoke to them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the state's economic growth, because today the economy is extremely complex.
"The most important thing is that they pursue economic growth, create investment approaches and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
In the context of the foreign transport sector, he asked the new members to share the required position in the state budget in order to promote the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the least of its means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings loans and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated money, the State security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been re-established in the previous legislative periods, must be brought to the latest stage.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want to see themselves.
For parents, it will be difficult on the next three days to satisfy these wishes, because the budget is no longer set up and not less than twelve persons and a pair book.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not entertain the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they see as they do.
The family lives in a small house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband has no job, but we're selling Mandarins and Cartofels... I'm going with the groins to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a pump or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie pump.
The 10-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for a while and for his eight months old cousin Jesus presents Cayetana clothes in the size of one year.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I'd love this monster', but I answered him, 'Let us wait, young' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled terriblely.
For the older children who were in school, dress and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of the 12th year of Isaiah the 10th year, while the eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by spending a toy or bar money in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 Duty drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the 10 household surveys were carried out in the administrative region of Estonia in the context of the completion of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Forty persons were arrested and various charges were brought against them.
The household tests were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the drug production was mainly used.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four Kilo Haschisch, bar money and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of Quebec's security police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, from which two men, who were considered chief drug dealers, came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest before the court building.
They may, inter alia, be accused of the production of Cannabis, their possession for sale, the complex and the service of crimes.
These domestic investigations have been carried out following a long-term investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr Ruel.
The 70 police officers of the regional intelligence unit Austria of the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police station and the Memphremagog police authorities had participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be pursued without problem
The draft law of the conservatives, which the Government calls on the Government to address the problem of ships loaded with domestic immigrants, will be brought to light after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not comply with the proposal.
"I'm going to stand up for this chart with a blackmail."
"I'm with a party that has put your feet on your feet," Michael Ignatiff, chief of the Liberals, said after the weekly Caucus sitting before the gathered members.
The liberals, who claimed that the draft legislation, which allows any person who came from a ship identified as the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, would be affected by the Canadian Bill of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Ducepe, Chief of the Block Québecois, also pointed out that he could not support the legislative proposal because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against this and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said Mr. Ducepe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has shown the critics by hand, who demand their party did not feel strong enough against the domestic immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats are agreed to take action against the blind passengers, and we are also trying to implement this by means of another legislative proposal, the C-35," said Chow.
We did not endorse the bill of conservatives because he seeks the debt of refugees and keeps children in custody for at least a year," Chow explained.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the wishes of the Canadians.
"Canadians are finally telling the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treat the country as a footstepper."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The Government has not announced any reliable vote on its legislative draft which could have led the country to vote which the Government had rejected.
A conservative, however, pointed out to the QMI agency that the government would take a vote in order to explain itself immediately to its voters.
The new unit does not find any consistency
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, existing unit to combat corruption and corruption since Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject since January.
Since 1870, the Metropole has a strong anti-corruption unit.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has only one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at least in spite of the presence of Robert Dutils in the last year of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police on 29 October.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québecois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "out of the heat-cooked rabbits" as well as "on a teasing-based solution".
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, once again used those who feared that political power had too much influence on the question, a future unit.
"They will see the result when we preach it," he said to himself.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parents, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the execution of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest needs to stop this investigation committee's education, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to form an investigation committee is the return of Jean Charest," stated Yves Boisvert, a professor for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State School for Higher Education and Higher Administration Officers).
In order to get out of this bag, he suggested to Quebec that the financial audit should be carried out by a special mandate so that it can set up research on corruption and secret talks.
"I should be able to extend the mandate of the inspection," he decided.
He also expressed the view that Quebec's audit control could assume the same power as Commissioners, which would allow people to make a statement.
The formation of an existing unit is not the only project in the government's warehouses.
Quebec will also be asked by Ottawa to amend the criminal law accordingly in order to be better placed on this kind of crime.
This request is from the Supreme Court of the Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the legal proceedings in this form of prosecution are not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed by his colleague Justice Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain innovations concerning this file.
During the operation of Princemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcyclists, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
That is why Ottawa passed the anti-gagstertum law.
Streams under strict monitoring
Several rivers remain under stricter surveillance because of the high rainfall that has taken place in some regions of the province since the day.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauritian Administrative Region, there was an earthquake on Wednesday.
Two houses were evacuated.
Another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere Administrative Region.
There's a road that's broken into.
Between 40 and 70 millilitres of rain fell on several regions from the middle of the day.
Between 20 and 40 other millimetres of decline were expected here, according to the regions until Donnerstagbend.
The northern regions of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouai region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimetres of rainwater down here.
As these lows are still to be counted the snowflakes that have already gathered in certain sub-areas, the transition of several waterways is feared.
At the middle of the night, a warning message was issued by the Quebec Security Service about the Oureau and Achigan River in the Lanaudier region.
The river runs in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentina Mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière will continue to be monitored here.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy snowfalls have taken over some lakes in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an outbreak was continued due to severe rain falls.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain seas has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract community.
The security service remains in alert alertness and monitors the situation precisely, as is the case with Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Country Water Centre, on the other hand, has issued a warning signal of the strong rise in several rivers, especially from machinery, assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Whether to give blocks random sizes
The Quebecer Roundfunk Moderator Stéphane Dupont, in front of the Canadian Board of Supervisory for Round Functioning Standards (CCNR), has experienced a partial return because of his controversial remarks about social care and Haitians as well as his excellent reference to funk.
The CCNR shares the opinion, M. Dupent and his CHOI 98.1 FM team, although it had the right to express its opinion, but certain statements had "inaccurate information on the social care and improper negative representations of the Haitians as well as such unconstitutional statements which are not appropriate for the broadcasts issued over the day."
The Board of Supervisors has also concluded that a discussion on suicides involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide against the code of circulation.
The CCNR received several complaints regarding comments made during the submissions issued in 2008 and 2010.
As a result of a complaint from the "common front of the person's social assistancees du Québec".
The most active organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were not accurate.
The moderators should distribute more solid than non-directive outputs.
With regard to the theme of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion that suicide was an expression of innocence.
The majority of the supervisory board members had taken the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Board of Supervisors takes into account that the implications of the "Dupont le Midi" would have been reduced by a sensitive topic in a legitimate and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was treated with no offense against his own person.
The last point concerns the statements about the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort had given themselves a medium-acting argument that there were many reactions.
The CHOI Moderator had explained that it was not for the benefit of Haiti's aid, since it was not sure that the needy would also receive the money.
The Board of Supervisors is of the opinion that these comments have not been unnecessary characters, but that their cumulative effect presents an improper negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already handed down my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My act has been young for over a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors announces the spread of an unencumbered expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM functioner has dealt with "on the basis of his obligations".
The consequences for the operators, inter alia, who should have been informed only within a period of three days within the main time limit of their decisions, shall be limited.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacerddine Zemmal, a Montreal Algerian origin, has completed a very special course.
The Athlet, which shines in "Sanda" (full contact with King-Fu), in the Kickboxes and in the Thaiboxes, is now looking for new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxings of the world.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with combat sports such as kung-fu and kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been involved in the Metropole since 2008.
I personally seek the fight of all kinds, because for those who present the fight on the ground, such as the mixed battle arts, there is no pleasure in fighting in North America."
He recently shared his character as a security officer as well as his rivals with the UPS company, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have achieved the victory in the categories of the complete contact of the Kickbox and the Thai box," he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"These fighters were invited from each category who had been placed in the first four World Championships."
"I was shot in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became behind Vietnam."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China at the fifth place, while I became in Toronto Thirder in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in each fight."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are native disciplines from China, in which foot-and-mouths and foot-and-mouths are also allowed.
The two battles usually play on a platform, rare in a boxing.
The most famous box fighter, made up of this kind of sport, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of war art.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event left in his career, he would certainly have called his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest level and seen in China," explained the sympathic pungent.
"It's a little like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
He had won his first battle in the semifinal of his category (80kg) before he lost it in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four blenders per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the stars to celebrate a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without a declaration
Hydro-Québec has granted 450 million dollars to projects for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-rupert waterpower project in contrast to the companies.
Among the more than 100 contracts in this valley is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor companies, which has received the most important share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without exception.
This Consortium, called "Energy Gerance", was formed in 2004 as a partner to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, its responsibility to respond to this important hydroelectric project of a total of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the "Energy Gerance" Consortium concluded the lucrative contract without giving a public statement.
For the Québécois party, the withdrawal of company associations is a serious ethical problem which poses the risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new type and way of a carded game and enhances competition."
"This means, instead of carded games, is done in a secret way and in an open form now," said Sylvain Simard, PQ's spokesman at the press conference yesterday.
On the morning of the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems hard to him to understand how the public interest can be expressed in this way and in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalia Normandeau had responded to this afternoon by putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that this contract had dealt with a detached game.
"I remain on my line," she added, strengthening the PQ to be "unfair" and "we miss you."
She said, "it's the least," that PQ is sorry.
The model of the Consortium is a world-wide practice.
It is usually a time-limited association which allows two or more companies to grant their expertise on an invitation to a description for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity with regard to its work scale.
The construction process is under way and will be scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the possibility of a competition dispute; it had already been negotiated.
In addition, the model of the Consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception for relatively simple projects.
As noted last week in the newspaper "Le Devor", the model of the Consortium object of government statements in the area of construction engineering and consultation.
A short transfer of the Quebec Company Register allows for more than 200 concerts, some of which appear to be of permanent duration.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and there are several thousand of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As the "Energy Gerance" Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special dynamic of work and that Hydro-Québec should take account of this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose has made the fact that the contract on project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make a statement and there are only a few bidders, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are present on this March and tell you that you will be able to negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not decisive, but the understanding of people," confirmed the report.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Energy gerance" is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 received by the Québecois Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-rupert project.
After an audit, the newspaper "Le Devor" numbered more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, companies or branches, including, inter alia, resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had reached 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Energy gerance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalling $449,783,344, including the "Energy guerance" contract over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had left that the four companies forming the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "liberal part of Québec must have known".
Minister Normandeau had agreed that the PQ should be equally linked to the companies they "financed", before she specified that it was much more about their leadership.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not reliable
Greens, but unbelievably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main factors of sustainable growth, but also less of the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
Unfortunately, there is a medium-acting universe where information is only as refreshing as information for a responsible consumer: Barometer responsible consumers have a lack of credible information, a lack of urgency that makes itself known as a bridge of commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have promoted the consumption of the so-called social products, in 2010, Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population have to give the company's environmental commitment as little faith as the green company's bid, so this is the instrument that is excluded from the relevant consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another insight: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official, mostly pure products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that claim to be environmentally-sensitive, the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discussion of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
The information on responsible consumption appears to be important for stimulating this consumer segment, which is currently only a third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and suspicious nature of the information affected the egg of 46% of consumers.
This is according to the highest price of the products the second, since the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, a third of the Quebecers are suspicious of the specific performance of the green products and services they are trying to put on hand.
According to another communication, over half of the consumers in 2010 had changed their habits and changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases by merchants in their city district and benefited from the purchase of food built in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmental awareness had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to remain before his car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or prefer the transport centres to demonstrate their ecological interest.
In addition, the additions and the driving cycle were encouraged by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural question, which feeds on the clicks.
State aid for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the parallele company to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complexe eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The development company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped to receive an amount of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of Daniel Langlois, a kinocomplexe eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to respond to this again of its real Chinese function, is obviously not receiving what they have demanded.
Although the Government has agreed to involve itself in this matter, it is subject to its own conditions.
Instead of the expected funds, the Quebec Government offers a loan of less than the originally expected height that could call for a viable solution to the conditions of life, at least in the opinion of the sources derived from the state backlog.
A first action plan and a request after 12.8 million had already been withdrawn last spring from Quebec, which has been corrected since the resummary down.
A proposal, together with a plan of action, has already been sent by the President of the "Société de dévelopment des company culturalles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who leads the eXcentris act.
A few days ago, he had given her a final report.
However, the Board's opposition proposal was sent by SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31st time to answer this question.
In any event, the state contribution premium seems to be actually forced on the side.
We call to mind that the Quebecer owning community of cinemas and cinema complexe was opposed to a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by offering the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he had not allowed to come to any other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment called for substantial economic aid.
Kinochof Daniel Langlois, after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years, had presented the author Kino in the rooms of his cinema complex, which could justify exclusion from the state cache.
The lack of kinosals, which show independent films, is more obvious in Montreal than it is, and eXcentris knew to keep his client at the stake.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on the other hand, controls a private-funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to finance the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one Leinwand has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future contractor is to open three cinemas next February 27th with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et deux" again.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not exceed the newspaper "Le Devor" and you ignore what he and his group hold on to the proposals that have been corrected.
The secret of Canada's complex shell is used
The new American diplomats, which were spread by WikiLeaks, revealed the secret of what the United Nations thought of under the Canadian minority complex against the Americans, but they also opened up the feeling of superiority to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters do not have Canadian-American relations in the election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were distributed publicly yesterday, offer even more impressive details than the mere substantive content to which you have to approach.
A data link of 22 September 2008, i.e. the period during which the federal election campaign was fully in place, tells of the fact that the United Nations no longer participates in the implementations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, an American messenger employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"One of the Canadians who live close to the local minority complex may require the Canadian political leadership to talk much more about internal conflicts of the day than the United States will send the black Peter to this election (as in 1988 in the free trade campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is therefore "the oral Goliath of this election: unpresented but potentially threatening to speak of him".
The messenger understands this "inexhaustible style" much less because both countries are deeply involved in political and economic relations.
"Logistically," he estimates, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind at the beginning of the race as a key actor."
The other expression of this feeling of importance appears on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure that the Government continues to remain in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada's first deficit will be announced after more than a decade, which has been set up by a budget programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," explains Breese.
In any case, he stated that the Government had to reject Parliament's sitting before Christmas to prevent Parliament from being cut off from the coalition and that the continued stand by the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed consumption programme.
A further, dated January 2008 and by Ambassador Wilkins's message, Washington is aware of the ever-increasing picture of the spread of the dramatic series of CBCs from the United States.
The messenger is excited about shipments such as Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle performances on Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or even performances for the purpose of muscle parts of the CIA.
Another report is detailed on how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meetings whether Europe was ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "fall to Case" decision.
But at the end of the meeting, he described it as "the Secretary of State has issued a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has said to re-examine the act."
Finally, we note that the mutants build themselves on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flaangan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained through CBC that the responsible responsible for this massive Leck should be "incarcerated".
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Refreshment of Light
In Cancun yesterday, UNO proposed a plan to update the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to the development of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position as part of the concrete large projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction obligations of the industrial countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW produced on the ground is to be avoided if the white-fashioned beers, which are still representing 50 to 70% of a monopoly on the market, are replaced by fluorescent or even better, light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world.
In Copenhagen last year, large gas carriers such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it was necessary to remove 5 gt from this balance in order to stabilize the climate level of 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this out of control.
In the white glowing beers, 95% of energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED bulbs, this energy demand is again reduced by the double.
The compact lamps are between 6,000 and 10,000 hours apart.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips brought this week into the market - this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-light beer, which provides an increase in the opportunities for the exchange plan to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that the ice of completely new raindrops only produces very little heat, they can also function with a regular resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact lamps contain reserves, as they contain mercury and that they need to be removed as a special powder, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers, to provide an admission proposal.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, is not the compact lamp, but rather the coal power plants that release significantly more mercury in order to generate electricity used by the white light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants cost 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report provides details of the gains that would be generated by each country through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Elfen cost expected to be announced by the selection results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the publication of the results of the presidential election of the Elfenbe cost immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Election Commission to receive its work and to make known the preliminary results without further delay," said a press speaker from the UN Chief.
"It calls upon all parties and institutions of the Elfen cost to demonstrate their responsibility and to include each initiative until the initial results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deathline established on Wednesday night, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the press release, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "go on with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from around the world were heard, but the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the distinguished Laurent Gbagbo and its opposition Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo warehouse, however, is due to the cancellation of "refuge" votes in the north by the Constitution, which was obtained by the former rebel warehouse of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed Putsche in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign at the Elfenbeinkos, confirmed that the manovers practiced by the United Nations in favour of the electors in the north of the country had urged the president's candidates to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo partners are now more likely to see that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who cut off any connection to the ex-rebellious ex-rebellies, has considered the delay in announcing the election results as "unfailable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to ask for victory.
His party confirmed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results as he knew he had lost; and that a complaint was filed before the Constitutional Court after the election of the Commission had prevented it from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were held for the crowning of a country's union and marriage process, which was split into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the policy makers of the elephant cost that they could be held responsible for this in the event of any fines.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who welcomed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% stable in the Metropole for the International Labour Agency (IAA) (with the involvement of the overseas departments to 9.7%), thus showing the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Statistical Institute of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the Metropole is 2,631 million.
The data of the second quarter were 9.3% of the eligible population in the Metropolis and 9.7% of the departments in Overseas.
Over the year the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter of the French Metropolis, 3.4 million workers were not employed, but they wanted to find a job, whether they were now able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were working or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has increased by 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the area of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed.
The seniors, on the other hand, have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (see + 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% with the involvement of the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the Metropolis (-0.1 percent over three months, +0.1 percent over a year) and 8.8% in France.
Following a review of its accounting procedure, the Statistical Federal Office of Insee has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to carry out this method and announced a 9.8% quota on Tuesday in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a relief company and brother of the President of the Bouches-du-Rhône Council of the Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was placed in prison in Luyne near Aix-en-Provence during a investigation procedure.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with imprisoning the assets of society, the destruction of generals, Heherrei, the co-operation in corruption, illegal possession and possession of weapons, as his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is prepared to address all the issues that will be put to him by the government, instead of spreading iron pens."
"It is easy for him to present a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Raul of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his mandate.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (part of the socialist) department, had the honour of allowing the judge, before hearing him, to come up with a memorandum of understanding.
Philippe Rapezzi, an official of Guérinis, was also accused and arrested on Wednesday.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her husband had never done anything else than his deposition that he had to lead to keep running.
With regard to the business competence area or the objective of the fund associated with it, he had never known, as Simon did.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Balming Room, was also charged on Wednesday for defeat and complicity, but then, under the pretext, to be kept under judicial supervision by the protagonists of this act, on a free footing.
"My mandate was able to provide explanations of the facts that were foretold to him."
"The leading government lawyer has taken into account that he is not deprived of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and were released from prison on Wednesday night at midnight, including two of them under legal surveillance, such as the Chief Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Managing Director of the management company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted due to "unauthorized influence and passive deterioration".
Two state officials from the Ballungsrooms Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringeier were also arrested, which, under the title "Averagement and Rehabilitation of Generals by a Public Service Officer", were arrested because of the other "Affiliation of Public Finance".
The life-threatening of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "heavy and depletion of society's assets".
For the persons who were transferred to Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard is recently arrested because of a similar case of fraud involving Corsica.
The hunters suspected his company of helping him to clean up money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X due to potential fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the field of procurement, will be conducted in April 2009 by anonymous letters in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation suggest that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the addition and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, as well as on waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exceeds its central function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", the French public in Atem, replaced the diplomacy in alertness and highlighted the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents from WikiLeaks and the "Le Monde" newspaper show some basis for this crisis.
She described how Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far to give these advices to deal with their own crisis of "circumcisions" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of young Frenchs is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and the American justice has been punished by the Iranian nuclear programme for dealing with material.
Finally, they set out the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose, to make these ideas believed by the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad, who played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 includes the title "Iran: French comments on the way and way of dealing with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée-Berator in Strategic Questions, joined with Patrice Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegron.
They explain the French method.
They urge the Americans to put everything in their hands to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Matt Lärm", they said, "articularly and clearly and without permission" the words "Generic human rights", "Unfortunately release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into line, which is very sensitive to its image.
"This is so much more than the Iranians ask you not to do."
Because "Styllswheit doesn't solve anything", the discussion test goes on unhindered ways, the Iranians are "masters in the Overseer".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "prolonged, Iranian tactic": "receiving for the purpose of political repression".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should come on August 16th, on the day when she moved into the French message) "demanded the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230.000 euros).
And he's got to admit that the elysie is more anticipative of the brain, a phenomenon that "will get stronger".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but remains in Iran.
An information was provided in progress: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, was dismissed from the port after the decision of a director in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American message raises questions about this disturbing connotation.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of nuclear material, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a corn trade?
The liberation of Iran from those of France?
On September 4th again, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the decision of the Director", but also tried to settle against it.
"It has given a rich exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the legal decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strong" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée-Berator selects a phone number, puts it up again, informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "now in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris".
While Clotilde Reiss's reality in Iran has not made her efforts to believe that by means of transportation and by the media organized "flight tests", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential midleral role".
The Americans did not observe this activity without irony and found that the manipulation brings fruit because several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 called out "the French authorities' media bloc".
On the basis of so many "thanks" against Mr Assad, the Paris message is asked.
"In spite of their statements of praise, the French authorities are secretly saying that they have only a vague knowledge of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document thus deals with the reasons why Elysée has brought this fiction to fall.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up against Syria", he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was adopted at the time "by many critical votes in France and abroad as early and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building" tries Paris "to lead Syria in front of the eyes which you can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also the aim of "to be a source of support between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On 11 August François Richier assured her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything else."
"But we have always been grateful to them."
"This should at least upset the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our people".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Ash brother", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight, preventing them from accessing government officials.
A bill to ask online players to refuse access to these games within 16 years after midnight will be submitted to Parliament in December, representing representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life every day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, with this draft bill of the French press agency Agency France Presse, explained.
The online games will then be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies had been preparing for the application of the law for a long year, so he specified it.
The government also takes note of the request by the manufacturer to withdraw the time limit for access to these games on a daily basis to those young people whose parents ask them to do so added to the responsibility.
It will also provide free programs for those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also an infamous champion in the online game competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea had reached 58 other nations with four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the Country of Directors
In the wake of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the countries of the World Championships 2018 and 2022, the highest political choice, in which the ranges of influence and lobbying should influence the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, the Netherlands).
The issue of 2022 will then appear more exotic; the International Football League hopes to be able to win for itself new territories (Katar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent's premier, or to continue its subsidization in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of economic and political use of a world empire.
So the manufacturing companies behind the scenes are going to be held up to the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the funerals, would also have been able to destroy the chances for her own country, the shores of the football, which only once claimed the world champion, namely 1966.
The BBC had re-enacted it on Monday by issuing a documentary report, which was adopted by three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
There is enough reason to despise the FIFA and bring the English officials in possession, first of all, who had an intense lobbying with David Cameron over the past few weeks.
The Head of Government is looking forward to a new surface of the prize won by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Spanish portugual is not lacking in drums with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial side of the two countries could capture their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English as well as the doubts about Solvenz Spain and Portugal will increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its location in the file (Stadian, Hotels, Transport), has become a major outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to express his unintended appreciation to the English press for "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"A man argues with pressure, tries to compromise," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
The first economic world power, the seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages against Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
These new candidates, however, appear to have been disappointed by two countries that had organized the wars in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 by the FIFA, which will allow Asian opportunities to be suspended by 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had taken all the registers with the expectation of future tourist stadiums, the FIFA monitors its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because of uncertainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by the European countries (on the basis of time difference), which is the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second Mandate: the Publicity
The Gaulle had really fallen.
Meanwhile, he would have thought he was slow.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the smallest teeth.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than this one.
A mandat in Elysée calls the next call.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not the face of the mystery, which takes place in the Presidency.
So you have to do as much as the doubt continues.
In one way or another.
In 2006 the appellants Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third term should not be excluded without believing in it itself.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure to meet his decision to "extremely in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would be able to secure the prospect of "two mandates" on the day of service in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians would have made a little sense of Fierce.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
We're in the wrong place.
The President merely reminded us that the amendment to the 2008 Constitution had limited the number of five-year periods to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he mentions the presidential election of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You've been with me for seven or seven years, or best," he explained in July 2009.
In a new May 2010: "I don't think about the phase after that."
His words from the previous day will no longer make him a candidate than the previous day; nor will it be less.
If they are to make comments, then for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the wind speed around the candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, who seeks to reveal himself.
On the other hand, it is its obvious candidate in 2012, which many PS members are recommending early to fight.
Bad questions on the other side.
For the first time, the right-holders would prefer a candidate from François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister responded immediately and carefully.
"If he could find a download as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," says Alain Juppé, who has discovered himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to keep its purchases of state paper
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank in the past year should provide an opportunity to show how one comes out of the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures to come to an end of the year.
The crisis of European State debt requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can't achieve its own chances, even if today’s situation on the European loan markets is more tense than it is.
The political costs would be too high.
The French Minister of Finance Christine Lagarde had recently welcomed a press conference, which the ECB had adopted as an active role in solving Europe's debt debt.
It did not wait to say whether it was the view that the central bank could do more, for example by refurbishing its procurement programmes.
"I kept my views on my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels, on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, did not show very much about his work, but was more pleased to show that the purchase programme of state paper would "continue" on the secondary market and that we would "see how the decisions will be made on Thursday" at the meeting.
Only certainty: The ECB will be able to maintain its leadership by 1%, the most historical lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Board of Auditors were doubled to about EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to the indexes of some dealers, they should have made new purchases in Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the euro system’s central banks have totalled EUR 67 billion.
Among the dealers, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase course is not confirmed at all (see page 29).
People's prices are no longer expected to be a significant change.
If loans are already lost from the ECB's Arsenal for more than three months, they will still be made available to the unlimited reserves of funds free of charge over a period of one week to three months.
People's prices are already considering that this measure will be extended within a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
" Otherwise, they would risk putting new efforts into short term," says Michael Schubert, the People's Bank of Commerce.
"A progressive rise seems more likely to me for the first quarter of 2011," predicts Norbert Brams, Volkswirt at Sal.
Openhouse.
In the area of their intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchase on obligations that sustain the market," added Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the position of the European banks on the euro area debt markets, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"They must make every price available to the operators of the missing investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent early interest on the payments paid to the weakest countries," said one important obligator yesterday.
Because if the interest rates were to increase, it would be even more difficult for the States to reduce their debt or only to stabilise.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi goes to Italy to cover
After a week’s break for Italy, the situation has been a little slowed down in the past 10 years.
It's a return to a triangular style.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional president, Giulia Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "uncountable" and had heard it with a "unpredictable" week, however, what was immediately demented by the concerned.
On Tuesday, however, the threshold with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts for the coverage of the competition risk had been estimated at 263 points, which had led to a certain flexibility in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out at his ministerial council that the Spanish discrepancies are based on the German interest rates at 400 base points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had been described as "hardly concerned" by the "market bubbles" and a possible risk of closure from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In short, its problem is that the lack of economic growth and the resulting fast-paced taxes that threaten the state are no longer able to cover its financial needs.
The last Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian increase of 1.1% will be expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for auditing the Senate is estimated at 1.3% relatively 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission will calculate the budget deficit in the next year by 4.3% of GDP (compared to 3.9% by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7%).
This is why a new collection of budgets could also be used after the holidays to a total of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new precautions must be taken," said economic inspector Olli Rehn.
In an hour, Italy will receive support from international institutions.
"The fundamental foundations of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are in order, which we will continue for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, entrusted to the IWF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either on short-term or long-term terms, as Italy has been calling for less stabilization progress than other countries, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) in Italy," observes Pier Carlo Paduan, CEO of OECD.
The question remains after political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be presented with a mystery item from the Chamber of Deputies, which may be organised by the end of March.
There is therefore a low-cost period for a decision on a serious crisis.
European concerns the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had expressed it yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been proven on Sunday and on the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency."
Despite completely relatively recent withdrawals in the interests of European State obligations, water was at the expense of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of a normalization cannot be the talk.
The rating agency had announced Standard & Poor's, they could capture the debt note of Portugal, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May there is a real lack of clarity and political certainty, which is particularly responsible for banking systems," says the opinion of the peoples of Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time is much slower than the markets."
The European countries, which are aware of the danger of both this scourge and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the already existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and their opponents of the G20 go well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the absence of non-conventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area in the chain of markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, their Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernot about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If his visit is not an express fundraising goal, he will certainly prepare this ground for it.
The first publication expenditure by the EU Stabilities Fund is planned for the next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the U.S. Reuters agency was entrusted with the United States to support a possible increase in the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first line, are sending on their side structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be brought to the wake but will have to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have chosen another way, as they have done in Greece and Ireland.
Both one and the other need to avoid any price to seek international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and have decided on non-accessible structural reforms that will give them confidence.
The European capitalists also have the options available to speed up the normalisation process of state loans.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on 24 November, had first developed the idea that if the 750 billion euro mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to relocate it into its own pocket.
As regards the European debt market, the people's prices of Barclay's capital would be sufficient for an extension of around 100 billion euros, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity gap.
This means that the European mechanism for financial stabilization is now EUR 60 billion.
A team which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the main European cities.
Especially when market conditions are met.
Snow and ice cream: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snowy episodes still lead to traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Britain, and tend to interfere with various economic activities.
Four-six departments are now located in Orange Alarm Station due to the disturbing snow and ice risks.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have already reached 20 departments in Orange alarm level; 18 from midnight to midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, so later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intensive skiers reach the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the Et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, cuts of 2 to 5 cm are also expected from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to raise traffic barriers and affect certain economic activities, Météo France said.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads for heavy traffic are closed by over 7.5 tons, including the Guangamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Britain is according to the traffic police, who opened up to use their own vehicle only when necessary, very difficult, and the use of some TE bus was spent the whole day.
In the Picardie, the school transport for Thursday was up.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the medium-term.
The Prefecture "needs the car driver to be more careful about the roads and the appropriate adjustment of their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to strike 25% of their passengers on Thursday from the Paris airport Roissy and 10% of Orly's flights from starting flights due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
The Gatwick Airports in South London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial dividends
Since the debate on modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France has been in full progress, it has been worth billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is called to mind.
In order to lead the construction of the GSP into the way, the State has issued a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would enable the SGP to give on the markets part of the financial sum to its double.
Today it has finally come to first calculations.
The 2010 additional budget, which is provided by the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the measures envisaged to cover the first part of this money.
There are two measures in this regard: the creation of a special tax for the creation and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
First of all, the adoption of Article 15 of the Bill of Law is "for the benefit of the public-law agency Société du Grand Paris".
This is the case: "The product of this tax runs at 117 million euros per year".
Second, it is a new regulation of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise this to increase this from its product and to offset this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
A bullet.
This sum is not in the text.
Out of the 4 billion people, you're far away.
"It is estimated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euro of the capital taxation imposed by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris will be used for the project," the statement is made.
The SGP does not even find this system offensive.
"Since the moment you are booked revenue (the two taxes, R.), you can cover the project over three years and then create from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget, after and after."
The SGP undertakes to start 2013 to notify the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which is still able to search for 4 billion people, is about to raise a legitimate parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Justifiable hackers and impeccable spy
The WikiLeaks case has a double significance.
On one side she has pushed herself out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of holiness, which governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and there is a premise on the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-like nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary" American speculations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than what you have been able to read in months as well as in every x-like journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the amazingly characterised profile Gaddafis has been inhabited by Cabaret artists for a long time.
The rule that the secret files can only consist of news already known, is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and that is not only in this century.
If you go into a library that is devoted to the esoteric publications, you will find that every work (over the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the Rosenkreuzler) is repeated exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish occult texts (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existence), but because those who turn to occultism, believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The Secret Powers, too.
The informant is false, and false (or limited spirit) is also the chief of the secret service (and otherwise he could always be anything, for example editor at libération), who only considers what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American message had sent to the state branch in Rome was the same as those that had already published the Newsweek last week.
Why, then, was such an increase made in the contents of this file?
On the one hand, this is what every trained person already knows, and although the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government authorities can call each other or take a plane to meet at evenings - have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of detection films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of sincerity that you do so to ignore this.
However, the fact that it is publicly repeated damages the task of cleanliness and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-like hacker can unlock the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the great fight against the prestige of the state.
In addition, the scandal reduces the victim's sacrifice as much as the "scraper" in stress.
But we love the deep nature of what is happening.
First of all, at Orwell's times, you could surrender all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Whether prophecy could have been completely correct since it was possible to determine where any movement can be controlled by the telephone, any transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would be the total victim of the power.
However, if one turns to what appears today that even the secret encryptions of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process will stop, be focused on one side and will become circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the ruler of the citizen - the secrets of the power can bring experience.
How, though, can a power that is no longer capable of verifying its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be buried); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or markers is basically a secret free of secrets, since it offers the public treasure; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it is clear that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, which means that they exercise any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but against Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this disorder, which has been added to such a powerful force?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer be provided with any information stored online - that would be equivalent to a statement attached to the road link.
But it is also obvious that it is committed to the current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State continues in a plane and has contacted a colleague.
In the future, how can personal relationships be maintained for certain ears only?
I know very well that my predictions at the moment are being heard by science fiction and romance, but I see it necessary to present to me the government agents, moving in a secret way and in a manner that is uncontrollable on uncontrollable routes, keeping their communications elsewhere in mind, and in addition to the few written information they have received, which is stored in the shoe section.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: the spy test of watergate would have been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology has advanced today as a cancer, i.e. back.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) videocassettes had enabled the film researchers to discover a band band by being able to jump from the back and all the secrets of the assembly, while today's (numerical) CDs do nothing but jump from chapter to chapter, so in macroporations.
The high speed train takes you within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this takes three and a half hours, including flight, including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual for policy and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what had been damaged for secrets between the messengers.
At present, it is the messages that require reliable information from the press.
Climate: how France enjoys its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the rapidly resolved financing agreements (also referred to as "fast start" or early financing) which have been implemented by the developing countries.
And they're already covered by the grave French beauty scenes.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
On the basis of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn up all registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to the fixed-start financing: detailed progress report by its Member States, press conference, major disadvantages, distribution of brochures.
The operation transparency is noted and graded for its real value: developing countries and civil society are pleased to see if all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced that it would have released EUR 2.2 billion, which would lead to the proper way to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been made without the benefit of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission has proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the value of the guidance he considers best.
The EU Commission has, for example, identified itself as a guide for those of the year 2009: international funding will be maintained and will last for more than 150 million years under the fixed-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either for a year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding of the 2010 "all new projects" would be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total sum of the French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even give up) - France proposes to fulfil its obligation with regard to the "new and additional" funding.
Another decisive element is the award in grants and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his accounting mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 euro borrowed as equivalent to 1 € distributed.
Obviously, this is only difficult to represent: the power is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (also related to emission reduction projects based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it would be a mistake to present the euro, which is agreed to be equivalent to a spent euro... and only the cost of the loan to the country of capital should be estimated as an undertaking (i.e. the equivalent of a profit rate).
But France has nothing to do with the following considerations: it 'respects' its commitment to 420 million euros, taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that employs loans to a large extent.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (included) to meet their commitments to 100%.
In other words, when the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France only gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
In all of this, France operates in its fixed-start funding with a double-wind: to part with a further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of the financial use.
France is able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" has been issued in accordance with its commitments and saved to EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to have been Bercy's conduct of arbitration) could have a double negative effect on itself; once the EU is inside (why do the other Member States continue to spend it if it is sufficient) and then in the negotiations that the developing countries are not going to be fully closed...
The chapter of early financing is just a small question for relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope this won't be the case.
As is always the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year's early funding.
Firstly, France could declare a change in its accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the nature of the long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently under discussion): the question of the "probability" or the nature of its loan could not be raised.
France could change its position in order to be further on the issue of conflict, as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for Environment Kosciusko Morizet, which will be held next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fixed start of France and its vision of the "surprisingness" and the use of loans would, of course, be based on the international confidence base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - from children’s simple pesticides
A 10-year-old takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, so a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which states that "in view of the low number of analysed samples, no statistically significant value has been repeated, but is an illustration character of the problem-treated", was generally within four years from July to September, from a 10-year-old child to the mealtime, plus an average meal time in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meal times - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were also examined as nests of laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other harmful substances.
The teller balance is low: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are possibly or possibly cancer-related, and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine-distorting factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for any chemical, individual-intensive substance are not exceeded in the near context of the cases, however, it is well taken that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogens or substances with endocrine agent is significant," notes the Union.
Already in the morning, only the butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as planned for the mid-term study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungizid banned in France.
The same applies to the green roots of Kenya, which are included in the mediums where the study has established traces of a strictly banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacks, the tuna fish from the belly, even the baguette and the rubber of pesticides and other chemical substances were picked up.
In the guide water, the analyses brought the presence of nitrates and chlorforms to light.
During the evenings, the laxstick was not loaded with 34 detected chemical residues at the "richest" and even the plastics used to heat the meal in the microwave were not unheated.
The ultimate risk of this "drug cocktail" for consumers "will probably be underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, on the other hand, "in view of the urgency of the situation", to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "calling on civilisation diseases".
In July a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
