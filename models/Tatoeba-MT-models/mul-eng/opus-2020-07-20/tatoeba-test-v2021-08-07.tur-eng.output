I told Tom I didn't know the answer.
I told Tom that Mary was telling the truth.
I told Tom to call me.
I told Tom to rest.
I told Tom to see a doctor.
I told Tom to keep going.
I told you, but you didn't pay attention.
I told you to clean up your room.
I told you Tom wasn't busy.
It's only been an hour.
I'm worried about him, too.
I've been making a 20-minute sugar.
I've been interested in her.
I've got a French class at high school.
I've seen French in high school.
He took it to the Queen of Kyoto.
I'm sure he'll win the fight.
I was looking forward to Tom being there.
I made sure that Tom was there.
I was definitely looking at Tom's not gonna do it.
I got my place at the end of the series.
I've got my motive.
I got the book.
I went to a wrong car.
I understand exactly what he said.
This proved that he was a thief.
It became clear that Tom couldn't understand French much more quickly.
The day he was born, the whole day was raining.
I'm practicing two hours a day.
It really depends on when it will be.
It's really a mess.
I tried again, but it's empty.
I've tried a soup prepared with Karides.
I tried to make him jealous, but he was the only one who wanted to stay.
I tried to forget.
I tried to convince Tom to use the car.
It's a bad habit.
It's a trade.
It's a nice day out there.
It's time to stop watching TV.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's a reason of war.
Cassus bee.
It's on me to see it again.
It's a hard word to translate.
It's a big commercial for a record record record chain.
Good plan, at least on the paper.
It's a great place to start.
This is a group effort.
It's almost full of hours.
It's almost written.
It's been five years since I started working in English.
That's already done.
It's great to win the prize.
It's a high-powered device.
Visit your eyes to watch Tom play basketball.
It's cruel to hear people speaking loud in a library.
It's an old joke, but it's good.
It's an ancient treasure used by secret tunnels.
It's a continuous period.
This opportunity will come to a man's feet in 100 years.
Such an opportunity will pass into man's hands once.
It's a chance to come for the rest of our lives.
It's a perfect place to start.
I'm sorry Tom didn't come here today.
I'm sorry Tom died so young.
It's a pleasure to be able to help you.
It's a pleasure to be here.
It's a political engineer.
This is a popular resort.
It's Nisan today.
It's a public security issue.
That's a short way to school.
That's a little problem.
This is a step that has been taken.
It's a treasure.
He's an amazing animal.
It's a mess.
It's impossible to talk when you're full of your mouth.
That's because he loves me.
That's why you don't want to be alone.
It's late one morning.
It's been a long time since I last saw you.
That was a good year.
It's been a hard year for me.
It's been a very difficult year.
It's enough not to do anything like that.
It's cold.
It's hot.
It's raining since morning.
It's been a few years since I was camping.
It's been two years since I last saw him.
He's been hot lately.
It's best to make calls to people from all over the world.
Being alone is better than being with a couple of idiots.
It's better to have a drink without running away.
This scares me a little.
Of course he doesn't know what Tom should do.
Cassus bee.
It's cold today.
It's dark here.
It's hard to analyze.
It's hard to get out of the car in cold mornings.
It is easy to fall prey to the desires and actions of others.
It's easy to imitate your feet.
It looked like a fairy tale.
It seemed like a lot of trouble.
Looks like you're all wrong.
He seems to understand the truth.
Looks like he's lying.
The rain looks like rain.
They seem tired of married life.
It looks like you won me.
We're still here.
We're finally here.
I'm hungry.
It's fun to watch you dance.
Game time.
It's getting harder to follow what happened.
It's gonna be a shame.
It'll be sunset after breakfast.
It'll be worthless.
After that, it'll be hotter.
You're going to be so beautiful.
You're coming too good.
It's great.
I can't talk to Tom.
It's hard to find a good place to live.
It's hard to find a job in the U.S.
It's hard to think of a life without a pet.
It's hard to say no to them.
It's hard to sell houses that need to be trained today.
It's hard to tell you something.
It's hot outside.
It's hot outside.
Doing this doesn't take half an hour.
It's impossible to love him.
It's just a time of isolation.
It's like the air's hot, isn't it?
It's like being at a sugar store.
It's probably raining today, so you'd better get some ice cream.
It's like selling fresh vegetables.
The station is more than three miles away.
There's a deadly heat today.
I've got a call.
It's never right to do this.
It's good to be a role model for others.
It's good to think about it.
It's nice to see the dream.
It's just good to talk to you like that.
It's nice to see you again years later.
It's tonight, but it's Sunday in Boston.
It's not a secret he's been lying under.
He's not a good car, but he's a car.
It's not all bad.
It's not always that easy to do the right thing.
It's not that simple.
It's not bad.
It doesn't look good.
Not very much, but it's never better.
It's not possible to live forever.
It's not exactly what I think.
I don't want to go, I can't watch you go.
He's not friendly.
It's no use trying to convince him.
It's raining all day.
All night long it's raining.
It's raining in Osaka.
Ten more hours.
Today's payday.
There's rain coming down from the bardak.
Very early.
It's very empty.
It's awfully scary.
He's really hot.
It's really nothing.
It's said there's gonna be a new airport in town.
He said Tokyo was a very safe city.
Tokyo is said to be a very safe city.
It's said Tokyo is a very safe city.
What they're writing about in the newspapers is a bit suspicious of what they're writing about.
It's raining in Boston now.
It's easy for Americans to say, "I love you," but it's impossible in China.
The air is very cold.
It's still hot.
It's in Paris.
Write.
It started with a kiss.
That's the best for me.
He's the best French restaurant in New York.
It's time to pay.
It's time to count.
Now's the time to pay.
It's time for us to get out of here.
It's time to leave here.
It's time for sleep, so close the radio.
It's time to go to bed, close the radio.
It's time to go to bed, close the radio.
Party time.
It's time to say goodbye to Tom.
It's time to start.
This is where the human eye is cut off.
This is Tom's only chance.
The air is hot.
It's too late to do this now.
It's too late to get back.
It's too late to visit them.
He's so quiet.
It's a bad thing to have fun.
We weren't supposed to be here so early.
It's cold in this room.
The weather is cold today, isn't it coming to you?
It's easy to worry about you, isn't it?
He's very funny.
It's very romantic!
It's hot all year.
The air's hotter.
It's written in Croatian.
You'll always love me.
You're not left to go.
It's been the weekend for us to paint the garage.
It took a long time to understand what he said.
It took five minutes to get to the station.
He's been released from his illness for four months.
It took me hours to do this.
It took a long time to decide where we're going.
He took time to sort out our problems.
It took some time for you to increase your speed, but now you're gonna be in love with it.
He went out on a beautiful day.
It's always been.
It's always been.
It was a bad try.
It's a painful trap.
It was a cold night.
Ticari was a fake.
That wasn't a big deal.
This has been a terrible experience.
It's a good job.
It's been a long time.
It was a mistake to stay.
It was an incredible feeling.
I'm sorry he didn't come to our party.
It's a very exciting moment.
That was a strange feeling.
That was a terrible day.
He's been watching.
It was very pleasant to follow.
She's been cold until Martha's.
It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?
It's hard for you, isn't it?
Oh, shit.
It was easy to find his office.
It was like I was hoping for anything.
It was exactly what I was hoping for.
It was like I was hoping for anything.
It was exactly what I was hoping for.
The air was cold.
It's hard to say hello, isn't it?
That was unregistered.
That's the problem.
He was lucky, and we got tickets for the concert.
That's what I wanted.
That's what I wanted.
It was Mike who called the police.
He was boring.
He was my last show.
It wasn't as easy as we expected.
It wasn't as easy as we expected.
It wasn't easy for him to keep his word.
He wasn't important to me.
It wasn't their first time.
It wasn't Tom who did it.
He was one of the great discoveries in science.
It was on the list.
He could've been taken in.
It wasn't really a problem.
That's really funny.
It was the call that made him do it.
He was very secretive.
He was still there.
It was a full "wow-mak" memory.
To sell our house was Tom's idea.
That's Tom who told me that.
He was very soft.
There was no water in the morning.
She deserved to try.
Mike took this rocket yesterday.
It'll be a long night.
It'll be over in a day or two.
It'll be raining tomorrow.
You'll have 100 dollars to fly.
It'll only take a minute.
It's probably gonna rain.
It'll rain in the woods.
It won't be as hard as you think.
It won't be easy, but it's possible.
He'll be fine.
The air won't be open.
He won't come to her.
He's been working hard.
Thank you, Tom!
It's sad if we're not allowed to do this.
It'd be nice to give a party.
It'll be hard to do it.
It would have been so easy to do that.
That wouldn't be right.
I understand Tom's a tired program, but if I can get a date from him, I really appreciate it.
I understand both of you.
I understood everything.

I was caught in a hurry yesterday.
I'm totally in a state of shock.
I liked it.
My eyes were empty.
There were pirates flying in my ass.
I was sleeping in the cold.
I was easily taken in by his mild speech.
My soul was in despair.
I wasn't smart enough to believe him.
I've been forced to follow my orders.
I was going to Boston next week, but I changed my mind.

I'm done.

I wish you hadn't found me.
I wish you had told me the truth.
I wish you good luck in the next round.
I wish you were here.
I hope you don't do this anymore.
I've been up before.
I woke up every hour.
I woke up with my headache this morning.
I woke up in an office where my girlfriend was standing.
I was wondering why Tom was here.
I was wondering if Tom didn't tell Mary to do this.
I wonder how Tom managed to win.

Who put this here?
Who is responsible for this?
I wonder who's responsible for this.

I wonder why no one's telling the truth.
Why is this so bad?
I wonder why it's so expensive.
I wonder why Tom gave it to me.
I wonder why Tom is so weak.
I wonder why Tom's a bird.
I won't want you to do that.
I'm not going to join the party.
I'm not gonna do it today.
I'm not gonna get hurt.
