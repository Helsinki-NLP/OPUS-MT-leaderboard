Please don't give Tom a false hope.
Don't give it to Tom, he doesn't deserve it.
Don't give it to that bastard!
I recently met Tom here.
I recently met Tom and Mary in the supermarket.
He didn't give in to fear, and that kept him alive.

According to the Tatoeby Guide, members are recommended to simply add the knowledge in their native language or translate it into their native language.

It takes a lot of time.
I'll kill him.
I'll kill you.
I killed two mice once in the morning.
I killed them.
It killed him for processing.
I'll cut the left.
I started writing a new book.
They started fighting about money.
I started reading the book that Tom hired me.
I started reading a new book.
You've started breaking up.
He started to explain what happened.
I spent the beginning of my life in the incubator.
Be very careful about it.
He's dealing with him like something.
She saved my life.
You saved my life.
They saved Tom two hours.
I started being in the front.
I'm starting to be like Tom.
I'm starting to understand.
I'm getting cold.
I'm starting to feel a little guilty.
I'm starting to lose patience with you.
I'm starting tomorrow at 6:00.
You're starting to push me.
The lock in the room began to burn.
Let's go!
Let's start a meeting here when Tom's here.
I'll start tonight.
I asked Tom not to do it.
Did you ask for a job in this company?
Did anyone ask me?
I want my money back!
I'm asking for the money back!
No words will show how amazing you are.
There's no giraffe going through this river.
No bones are broken.
No conversation during the test, people.
There is no solution.
No trees have fallen.
None of these tricks are mine.
No honest man can go to politics.
No man ever asked me about it.
There's a big garden behind the house.
He took the game.
The event is still unsolved.
We took the horses to the building.
He's missing the driver.
It's funny.
How long will you be ready to leave?
For what purpose?
What team is Tom playing for?
I'd be interested in what Tom should have changed his mind.
I'd like to know what the future will be like for Tom.
I'd be curious how Tom got into my house.
I'd be interested in Tom's idea.
I'd like to know if Tom's busy.
I'd be curious if we could save this situation.
I'd like to know if Tom slept with her.
I'd like to know where Tom is now.
I'd be curious where Tom ended up.
I'd like to know who's going to lead.
I'd be interested in how many mistakes I made.
I'd be interested in how much Tom knows about that matter.
I wonder if Tom's still tired.
I'd be interested in what Tom really meant.
She was wondering where Sam is and what he's doing.
I was curious when you came back.
I'm interested in French speaking.
Are you interested in that?
You're interested in art?
The forbidden fruit is delicious.
I bought a new computer.
He's trying to convince the teacher.
She screamed at him.
Shut your mouth when you're thirsty, you're crying, or you're crying.
I'm sorry her hair had been cut off.
"I care much about you," she confessed.
Please wait for flowers.
The warehouse was paid.
He's stuck on her.
Put it under your armpit.
She fell in love with the Russian passenger.
You fell in love with her for the first time?
To love is one thing, to take one thing another.
I put the gun on the ground.
She's locked up in his bedroom.
Did I close the main entrance?
I've been thinking about this role this time of preparation.
Don't lie to me.
I don't care about anything.
You paid more than you had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid the payroll.
You paid more than you had.
I'll pay for Tom's list.
Will Tom pay for it?
Please turn off the radio.
Please shut down the radio.
Please shut down the TV.
Joining Tom would be dangerous.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Did you forget everything we did for you?
Forget it, it's not worth it.
Forget about this sad incident.
Forget I said it.
You forgot to call Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to take a note on the envelope.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to ask for an account.
I forgot to go home.
I forgot the money on the night table.
I forgot my password.
I forgot to get Tom out of the airport.
I forgot Tom could read French.
I forgot to fuck.
You forgot your act at home.
He forgot the keys to come back.
He'd sell his soul to the devil.
For the first time without the crown, for the second time.
Did I write everything right?
The rules do not control oxygen.
I'm the last one to learn the truth again.
I've lost my chess again.
You're lying again.
You came back to your old ways again, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talk.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We slept.
My heart stopped.
Will anyone stop dealing with people?
He shot himself for unhappy love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot both of you.
They took her to the castle and raped her.
While I was reading, I called.
While Tom was sleeping, Mary was already upstairs.
You can still be with me.
You're still not breaking anything.
Did the police arrest him?
Did you arrest Tom?
Hold the gun.
I don't pay for this.
I won't pay for this.
That's what Tom's bothering you.
I can't handle Tom.
You have no responsibility for Tom's death.
Tomov's fault was that the whole group was raped.
I love you for that.
I'm not paid for that.
Three months ago Tom was dead.
They paid me five dollars for that bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call back when I get back to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back later.
I'll call you back later.
She's calling back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, okay?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call the rescue!
They shut Tom down so he can't escape.
I locked the door so they can't hear us.
I closed all six windows.
Close the book.
Please close the door.
Close the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translation.
We're singing another song.
I called the bell and I was waiting.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She worshipped him.
I worship the ocean.
I love you.
Military industry brings profits, but also suffering.
We've got the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What's the butter made of?
I don't agree that this is how it happened to me.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.
Looks like she was hiding.
I felt like I was fighting in the war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
I felt like I changed my job.
I thought I was on the bike.
I thought it was about a colleague at work.
I thought about Tatoeb.
I thought about this day.
I thought about Tom how he got back from the dead.
It seemed that the officer was afraid of their revenge.
Looks like Tom didn't realize that Mary was there.
Looks like Tom's got everything he needs.
Tom didn't seem to understand anything you said to him.
Tom didn't seem to be alone.
It seems to be very sleepy.
I think Tom is responsible for Mary's nerve cramp.
It looks like it's too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night tonight.
It looks like it's coming very quickly.
It looks like I'm still asleep during the day, but it looks like I can't even sleep at night.
Looks like I've done it all out of my mind.
Looks like you're comfortable with yourself.
You seem to have the same problem as me.
I don't think anyone understands me.
I don't think anyone understands me.
You don't seem to take me seriously.
He seems to have found a lot of money.
Looks like nobody's ever noticed anything.
Looks like the war hasn't ended yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do it.
Tom seems to be blind.
Tom seems to believe how much more people are going on.
It looks like Tom's crazy if that happens or not.
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
Tom doesn't seem to remember any of us.
Looks like Tom's gone.
Tom seems to have lost the meaning of life.
He seems to know everything.
Looks like he's neglecting his duties.
Looks like they're losing motive.
Here's a picture of my school.
There's gotta be a roommate here.
We left home early in the morning.
I'm going to go ahead with her.
I'm gonna take care of Tom asking for help.
Health relations develop freely.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
She's holding her back from work.
Only one of the twenty students read that book.
What airport am I flying from?
What are you drinking from?
You're going to have sex.

Women must feel that they have the opportunity to do whatever job they want.
Women don't care about him.
Women like tea.
Women don't care about him.

They asked if they should write a new dictionary.
They asked Tom if he felt safe with them.
I asked them where the train is.

I asked Tom where I should put him.
He asked if he'd come.
He asked if he'd come.
Let's ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
Ask your mother.
He made a sound, so everyone heard well.
He's got some radio.
He grew old, he was jealous and divorced, but he also got rich and became famous.
He tried his best to stop thinking about her.
I didn't like him from the beginning.
Shut up, please.
Get out of here!
I'm sorry.
We live alone.
We've been living in this town since 1960.
Do you like living there?
He lives in bed.
I live modestly.
I live in town.
I live in a community where most people can go to work.

The life of the banker is difficult.
Life is a gift and love is the answer.
Life is like a furniture bubble.

Life is tough and difficult.
Life is wonderful.
Life is a lot of suffering.

I found out the food's a little sharp.
I found out my bike's gone.
Did you find out how much Tom is?
From driving the bus, she got so bad that she started to get back.

You ruined Tom.
Who are you afraid of?
Check if you haven't forgotten anything.
Check it out, please.
I tried everything.
I tried everything.
Damn it!
Experience brings wisdom.
She tried it on her own.
I tried everything.

Try to feel a little bit.
Try not to be stupid.
Try talking to the police.
Try it yourself.
You're trying to get that shit out of you.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try to explain it to Tom.

Knowledge itself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.

I know him very well because I've seen him often in his father's office.
I know his name.
I only know a few words.

I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the real reason why you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.

The mirror is locked up.
It's broken.
They set up a new company in London.
I'll see you and Tom soon.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd give up all the matches if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Give me that advice.
You're breaking up the meeting.
She's got her face torn.
We can get a lot of valuable information from that book.
You're out of your mind.
That's why I wouldn't be playing.
Tom's a man now.
It's a waste of time.
The loss of the work she loved so much for it wasn't hurt.
We lost all our equipment.
He lost her.
I lost the shower that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the shower that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost my key.
I lost all my friends.

I've been involved in this quest.
I'd stay and tell myself, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We stayed calm.
Stay home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and close the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay in the motel.
I'm staying with you.
The knowledge of me has won.
Put your hands up before you answer.
Get out of the chair and help!
We know you.
We'll do better.
Can you do that for yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do that for yourself?
I've allowed the least resistance.
He's calling me!
The calls have been resolved.
The bells started ringing.
They called it.
I turned my pants around.
We're used to everything.
I'm used to it.
It's a second attitude.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
He used to have no hot food every day.
You're gonna get used to everything.
You're gonna get used to it.
