An increase in the incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for an island of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical attention and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of etiology unknown in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China was reported.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases in China reported that the cause agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that the majority is recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 has evolved to a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality in patients hospitalised by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO definition of case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been detected in the 30 EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (EU) countries, as from 31 December 2019 and that date including 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths have occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the accounts of COVID-19 cases reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and RU and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases reduced to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA and RU country during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the aggregate number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and RU countries
The trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases reduced to 14 days in EU/EEA and RU countries were generally followed by the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the Soviet Union in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEE and RU countries showed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 similar (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries, compared with Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and RU countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that pandemics are advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries, variations in national public health responses and possibly different definitions in countries and protocols to select patients who should be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed evidence.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 would require intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (the data are not shown).
However, it should be systematically collected to complement the current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a wide variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in each 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds of intensive care and average care every 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios with regard to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the RU of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk >90 % of the capacity of intensive care beds are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been aggregated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the RU countries, hospitals and intensive care units are generally addressed to a defined regional capture population, information on cases and intensive care beds must be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who require medical attention and, in particular, intensive care, as is taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change of a content approach to one mitigation, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give the decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response in a manner that is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, the health systems of other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an island of patients who require intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The disease outbreak by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the mucous membrane and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
COVID-19, however, has a greater severity and a lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects more people than young people and men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases, the purpose of this article is to provide an appropriate and complete analysis of the research topic, which is being developed rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and disease prevention.
Although many questions still do not answer, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgettable reminder for all Chinese, who were forced to stay home during the entire festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as Coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and associated disease was called Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 more countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients with high data and more than 3,000 missing patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nei.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which has determined the sequence of the isolated virus from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to sum up the progress in research on this new matter that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a fracture in 2012).
We will also consider what is known to date about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronavirus has traditionally been considered non-letal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have found two times with highly pathogenic coronary viruses in humans, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused an original outbreak in China in 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus that is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, conglomerates of unknown origin were first informed by Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, he got to know the sequence of the coronavirus.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical attention providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in custody and all public transport were suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan marine market, which was considered the site of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared to be a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries worldwide (Figure 2).
Since the situation is rapidly changing, the final dimension and severity of the fracture cannot be determined yet.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people from all ages, but mainly people from 30 to 65 years of age.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 was expanded into larger conglomerates in Hubei and around it.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) would pass between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3,77 (95 % CI: 3,51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2,23-4.82.
The number of people infected has increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the mass mobilization period prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of the total patient was 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (masculinity), age (≥60) and severe neuromony.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and surrounding viruses that contain a single-sensitivity ARN.
It can be divided into four genders, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are infected by humans.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and METS-CoV, respectively, is added to its cell receptors, the angiotensin enzyme and the peptidil peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membranes are formed.
The viral ARN gene is released to cytoplasma; after the replication of the viral gene, the genomic ARN, together with the glucoproteins of the circulation and the nucleocapside proteins, the form of vehicles containing viruses, which are then merged with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first economic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan marine market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrasound sections of the human respiratory epithelial.
It was determined that the human ACE2 is a recipient of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to ACE2 more weak than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the Orf3b and a secret protein encoded by the Orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known domain or function.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of the ECE2’s electronic chriomicroscopy of full length in resolution 2.9 Å, combined with the B0AT1 transporter amino acid.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was gathered as a dime, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic diana for drug study in order to remove SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and average guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were born in mutants and were transmitted to humans through the wires and cables, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was considered that the mucielago is the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in a 96% to two coronavirus similar to the SARS of muchielagos called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what average host helped the virus cross the range of species to infect humans, and the transmission route remains clear.
Ji, et al., proposed to snakes as carriers of human musculoskeletal viruses, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that the pancakes (long-drinking vaccines that are used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic homology of 99 % in a discovered coronavirus in pangoline and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % spread by the whole of two genera remains a major difference; the final results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with 40-50 % moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and temperature at 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ester, ethanol at 75 %, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chlorform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to disable the virus.
All the human population in general is lacking immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
As a result, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4.4).
In general, after the virus invasive to the host, it is first recognised by the host's inhumane system through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including type C receptors, Toll receptors (TLR), NOD receptors (NLR) and RIG-I receptors (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus leads to the expression of inflammatory factors, the measurement of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic fagocytosis of viral antibodies.
SARS-CoV protein N, however, can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response takes place in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, perform an important function in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies for the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill infected cells with the virus.
Cooperative T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humanitarian immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodys, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated early bodies of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, the multi-orgal failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are committed are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and was between 0 and 24 days.
A more recent study, as described earlier, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographic of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the time of effective quarantine according to the more accurate incubation period; this is how it will be prevented that persons infected with asymptomatic infections transmit the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infection should normally stay in custody for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended 24 days?
Fibre is often the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptom or other symptoms such as dryness, dyskinesia, muscle pain, malady, headache, throat pain, kidney pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dementia or hypoxaemia a week after the disease appeared.
In serious cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in visual studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98 per cent for fever, 76 per cent for dryness, 55 per cent for dementia and 3 per cent for diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients would require respiratory assistance.
Similar Halazgos were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dryness (47%) and dementia (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of them would require respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the greater ease of MERS with regard to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dryness (29%-75%), dysnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS for November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and rose to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) from 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-COV R0 was only oscillating between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a capacity to propagate more than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its profitability is less than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of conglomerates often occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cross.
Patients often have prior travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to their arrival.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients given high hospital status can re-enter the virus, a warning that the time of the quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, linfopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of hepatic and muscle and myoglobin enzymes were high in the blood of some patients, and Reactive C protein and erythrocyte seduction were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, demero-D levels, a product of fibrine degradation present in the blood was high, and the lymphocyte content was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the Toracic radiographs of most patients with COVID-19, characterised by shades or oscillators in bilateral-smart glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II neo-uses decreases the surface level and increases surface tension, reducing lung capacity to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in Torah radiographs tend to be parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decommissioning of the neumacitis, the formation of a hyalin membrane and lymphocyte infiltration in the interstitial, and multinucleus sensic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) were started in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease events, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK based technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per sample microlitre) using a range of less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it is checked in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can best provide support care for patients with COVID-19, as they have proved with a variety of treatments used or proposed prior to treatment of other Coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients recovered, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
The plasma of patients recovered for treatment is even proposed.
The pharmaceutical companies work to see who develops first antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks at a lower level other organs that express the ACE2, such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high fluid oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extra-body oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of potentially fatal heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokines toxin is the result of an increased reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokines torture is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN, IFNβ, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead the immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and the multiorg failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 anti-receptive monoclonal body, have been used to treat cytoquine tormone.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytoquines are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blockage of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suspension of road 4 signalling of cytoquines, and HDAC inhibitors.
steroids, such as immunosuppressors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, high dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteoencrosis, which have a significant effect on the forecast.
However, careful use of corticosteroids in low-moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in critical conditions.
At the date of this analysis, the effectiveness of no antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue administered intravenously in a patient in the United States with COVID-19 has been verified.
Remdecivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential for inhibiting other viruses with monocatenary ARN, such as MERS and SARS virus.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the composition of China to carry out a few trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is a great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatic impairment and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of patients recovered and generation of antibodies
The extraction of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not burden the disease is not new.
In fact, patients recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogen in the blood.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected to 10 patients seriously ill.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better oxygen saturation in blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for its large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated derivatives should be considered in detention.
Antibodys, for example, may overstimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which may result in fatal toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that code effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that would vary according to the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with the MCT theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or uncertain, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China who used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had a lower recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly close comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment of Western medicine (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising, the rate of improvement of symptoms (low to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the ICT continues to wait for more well-controlled trials at greater levels and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to identify the effective components of the treatment of MCT or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in the quarantine also experience frustration, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoglycaemia and you, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental anguish.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric disorders were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotry excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirious and even suicidal tendencies.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory care, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of the infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, attention should be paid to mental health for patients with COVID-19, people with suspects and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health equipment, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 fraud and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential vaccines to interrupt the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to potential guests, and they often complement antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop proteins based on protein S to generate strong and long-term neutralising antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vacuums have been evaluated with live viruses grown in animal models for SARS.
However, the inviolability of these potential vaccines in older people and models of letal stimulation and their protection against zoonosic virus infection should be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the failure of SARS 17 years ago and no new case has been recorded since then.
However, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, similar particles and combination proteins subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the long-term difficulties (18 months in average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a new disease, recent COVID-19 has begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can be recovered gradually without centuries.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to give priority to their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on informed clinical studies up to now, the following factors may affect or be associated with the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which is also true for the COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mainly produced in persons aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described earlier.
Patients who required more intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly higher than those who did not require them (meaning 66 to 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described earlier.
Concomitants and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care with greater likelihood suffer from acute heart disease and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with positive ACE2 colloidals, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with one another.
Abnormal laboratory results: Reactive level of protein C (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictive factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the level of CCR and the severity and forecasting of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, high levels of dehydrogenate lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (CK) may also help predict the patient’s evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensively in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released when the tissue is damaged.
Finally, they constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: Torax radiographication and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with the other symptoms for the prevention of clinical outbreaks and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described earlier, steroids are immunosuppressors that are commonly used as adjudicating therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammation.
As high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed osteoencrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, since in general they endured long periods of extreme anxiety and uncertainty, and attended the death of close family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replication in higher respiratory pathways and cause mild symptoms or not cause symptoms in the early phase of infection, such as with other coronary viruses that cause common respiratory problems.
Therefore, patients infected in a temporary or incubation phase may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which make it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the SARS-CoV transmission would occur when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission would most often not occur in the interim phase.
In the end, the current COVID-19 fracture is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS fracture.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, which includes the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the Quartet continue almost all the population with the hope of interrupting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures are causing significant economic and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the deceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the bridge will have been completed for March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that the COVID-19, which seems to be significantly more infectious than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal exodus and pharyngitis in patients who had recovered and left hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the recently identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be functioning.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through a quarantine and strict isolation, disease control has been achieved.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infection and eventually expands or becomes a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through your toes or outlets, and possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the liver, which created a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent 138-case study reported that 41 per cent of cases may have been caused by nocturnal infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, care must be taken to protect people, especially medical care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and, even, transitors in contact with patients or persons infected.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical and respiratory masks with N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent the fluid gothicles of a potentially infected person from being transmitted by air or attached to the surfaces, from which they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 (series number 1860) masks can protect against inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measures of 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five attached surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, medical care providers should use isolation bats in order to further reduce contact with the viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite having used a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his infected eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protective helmets or transparent gloves while working with patients.
For the public in general of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with clean-up soaps later than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary care and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered to be an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high approval with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the citizens by saying that the new virus had a low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message made a significant public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time for the minimum level of disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements, as each word is relevant to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or staff; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in their temporary phase, rather than attempting to calm the public; and (4) more regular in implementing appropriate and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 fracture has generated the feeling of recovery of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and men more than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in youth.
SARS has a mortality greater than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 was promoted much faster and more generally than SARS-CoV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients treated can be positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the COVID-19 investigation, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses of similar mucous membranes like SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from mucous membranes.
What kind of animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original host, let's say, the killers, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to freeze the transmission efficiently, and the brake can re-surface at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory pathways and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also connected to the cells that express the ECE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the genetic virus evolve while being transmitted between humans?
Will it be converted into a global pandemic, excavated as SARS, or periodically resurfaced as flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to find answers to these questions and to many others.
However, it costs what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Soybeans of human coronaviruses
Change and adaptation have driven the evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronary viruses caused mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The acute respiratory outbreaks (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the currency in discovering how devastating and deadly human coronavirus infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus to the centre of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
The human caronavirus infection is a zoonoses and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human caronavirus.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in mutants, in which they are not pathogens.
The average reserve guests of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identification of animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could also generate important information on the pathogenicity of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as in their zoonotic origins and in the transmission of species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host change and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary ARN virus with a circulation.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the ARN viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, in the form of the crown they have under an electronic microscope.
As regards its structure, coronaviruses have non-separated genes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replication polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 proteins in structurally called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spice (S), in the environment (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific accessory proteins of each line are also codified by different lines of coronavirus.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genes (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the gene of betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that mucous membranes and rotors are the source of most alfacoronavirus and betacoronavirus genes, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five beta-ocoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogens and cause severe infections of lower respiratory pathways in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first branch of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, increased knowledge has been gained through exhaustive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause autonomous symptoms.
In fact, until the collapse of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating of the current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a severe lethargy of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the disease epidemic in 2019 (COVID-19), which has taken more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in musculoskeletal, ratites or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutional origin of all human coronaviruses in the mucous membranes, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has planted enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the impulse force and the factors of the inter-species-restriction.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and the intermediate and amplifier animal guests of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for preventing future propagation.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, transmission between species and pathogenicity of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parent viruses of human coronavirus are not normally pathogens in their natural reserve hosts, but that pathogens become pathogens after transmission to a new host.
We are also considering the trend of human coronavirus evolution, in which the increase in transmissibility often leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
It has been known from the end of the 1930s.
Before the first outbreak of HCV-229E of the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals, such as the pope, the rat, the cow, the pig, the cat and the dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus findings in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients infected with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and was subsequently adapted to the growth of WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, dizziness, general pain and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the latter became serious in lactating rats' brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rinovirus virus.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in climates covered.
In general, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompressed patients had a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS, also known as "atypical neumonymia", was the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS was remedied by the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases of 774 deaths and spread by many countries and continents.
In addition to the superpropellers, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the occurrence of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience headache, headache, fever, general malformation and scalophrenia, followed by dementia, cough and respiratory difficulty such as late symptoms.
Linfopenia, altered liver function and high levels of creatinine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory trials.
In patients with SARS, spread of epithelial cells, and an increase in macrophages are also observed.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by cytokines, which may be fatal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in small children, older adults and immunocompressed patients with respiratory diseases.
Crease, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken by a 8-month child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs at early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstetric laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronquiolitis acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and, generally, less suitable to change to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred because of unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a lower subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves to humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute neuron and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases of occasional contamination have been recorded in close contact in several European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute neumony.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal insufficiency, which to date only occurs with MERS among the diseases caused by human caronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with an altitude of 34.4 %, which makes MSRS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses in humans known.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of 2019, conglomerates were detected from patients with neumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also called COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a severe liquidity of 3,4 %.
Notably, the ease in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dementia.
Diary has also been observed in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high-carbon sequence of 82%, they are classified in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
Firstly, the period of incubation and the duration of the course of the disease by human coronavirus are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19's symptoms is found between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more often observed in human caronavirus infections acquired in the community, including non-specific or mild symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as happening with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is a little smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristics of human coronaviruses acquired in the community as well as SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to check whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transitions, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like the other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fake samples.
If SARS-CoV-2’s facal-hour transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it must still be discussed in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 might be able to exhibit stacionality, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human migration, will have an impact on the final outbreak of the ongoing COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of old human coronavirus pandemics.
Human caronaviruses have been eliminated that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that have developed serious human caronavirus diseases.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses should be repatriated in humans in sufficient measure to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that conflict with host restriction factors.
In this sense, the more time the SARS-CoV-2 fracture and the more people are infected, the more likely it will be to be fully adapted to humans.
If appropriate, their transmission to humans would be difficult to stop through the quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have been circulating in human populations and have caused common colds in immunosuppressive people.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV highly pathogens have not been properly adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to keep and spread in their zootic reserves and seek the opportunity to spread possible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics both to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and to the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible like human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will travel between humans without a reservation or intermediate animal guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, reserve, intermediate and amplifiers of human coronavirus.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related elder who shares a high level of approval of the nucleotide sequence.
The antistral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
In a similar way, a reservation guest is staying at a human coronavirus in a continuous and long-term way.
In both cases, guests are infected naturally and are the natural guests of human caronavirus or their parent virus.
On the other hand, if the human caronavirus was introduced into the middle host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenous.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of the infection in humans and perform the role of the amplifier host by allowing the virus to be relapsed transitionally and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of the infection in humans.
A human coronavirus may cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot support its transmission in the middle host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also be adapted to the average host and, even, to generate long-term anaemia.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservation guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Further studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Cives of the packed palm trees (Larvata Pamuma) and a dog map in live animals markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were recorded after killing all citizens of the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farmed palm trees were largely negative in SARS-CoV, which suggests that the poplars in masked palm trees acted only as an amplifier intermediate host, but not as the natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals on the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several small mammals also act as amplifier intermediate guests of SARS-CoV cannot be eliminated.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Further searches of SARS-CoV's natural host revealed a closely related musculoskeletal coronavirus called COV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus-related SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, which exists in musculoskeletals of China.
These mutants are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other musculoskeletal coronavirus shares an 88-92% nucleotide sequence approval with SARS-CoV.
These studies have established the basis for the new concept that muciélálagas host emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in mucous membranes, but no one, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
It is known that human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of musculoskeletal musculoskeletal use of the ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cells.
Surprisingly, patients with convalable SARS were able to neutralize HIV1.
To date, the WIV1 represents the most closely related SARRS-CoV ancestor in mucielagos, which shares a 95 per cent nucleotide sequence approval.
Despite the high approval between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that the mucielagos are not the immediate backup host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is classified in the same group as the CV-HKU4 mucielago and the CV-HKU5 mucielago.
The CV-HKU4 mucilage and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, peptide 4 (DPP4) dipeptidil, for the introduction of the virus.
The follow-up of the MERS-CoV polymerase ARN depends on the phylogenetic approach to its components of betacoronavirs of mucous membranes identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you can't find a live MERS-CoV in wild mussels.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CV-HKU25 mucielago, share an 87% nucleotide sequence approval.
At the same time, the striker may not be the immediate reservation guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that thinkers are neuro-positive in early neutralizers of MERS-CoV specifically, as well as the original camels of the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV live identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the thirsty nasal of drummers, which further supports camels acting as guests of the MERS-CoV good faith reserve.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms were generally observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for investigations with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by breathing but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main way of spreading viruses from the mucous membranes.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have prior contact with camels prior to the occurrence of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission routes that involve unknown animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a ratG13, isolated from aphine Rhinolophus mucous membrane.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the discrepancy of sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, mutants could not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of virtually identical mutants.
It is estimated that the average animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed on the master market in Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenonomic sequence have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) could also accommodate betacoronavirus anti-SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new coronavirus of panulins share a neucleotide sequence of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equal to closely related to the RTG13, with an identity of approximately 90 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sub-lined viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of union with the receptor (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence identity of amino acids of 97.4%.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the RTG13 are more divergent, despite a greater degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pancakes also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, resulting in also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of collecting and handling to generate a partial gene sequence that included around 86.3% of the total viral genome.
We cannot eliminate the possibility that the panic is one of the average animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that it supports a direct origin in SARS-CoV-2 panolin due to the sequential divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruss related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronoviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in mucilages, pancakes and other mammals must still be established.
Although higher sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and panolin, betacoronovirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high level of similarity between the RBDs of the betacoronone virus related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-propositor defends a combination of betacoronavirs of panolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, the combination is extended between betacoronavirus.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have been derived from musculoskeletal coronavirus, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rotors.
It was reported that a coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Cronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor mussel in North America had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another cancer virus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camels as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge that has been acquired until the time of the animal origins of the known human coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species until humans were infected from game animals in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of transmission between HCoV-229E species is not known with such precision.
Alfacoronavirus has been found with closely related mucielamus associated with HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of mutant viruses directly to humans.
First of all, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with the mucous membranes in a shared ecological nest.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpines.
Secondly, alphacorononevirus related to HCoV-229E is different and not pathogens in the mucous membranes, while alpacas alfacoronavirus causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility for alpacas to acquire alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E in humans cannot be eliminated.
In fact, mutants are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as the virus of anger, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It would not, therefore, be too surprising that the mutants transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while musculoskeletal alfacoronavirus acts as the genetic aberration of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dramedians could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from ruminants to miners, and from miners to humans.
The evolutional origin of MERS-CoV in the muciélagues is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that musculoskeletal agents contribute, with a wide range of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fractions between species and the transmission of species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, tight social interaction and the great ability to fly are all favourable conditions that turn the mutants into the ideal “virus promoter”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the miners for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have had to be an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reservation guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the MSRS-CoV transmission, the role of the pans, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the betacoronavirs of panulins are highly pathogens in the pangolines.
It is possible to be a terminal guest of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several transmission possibilities between SARS-CoV-2 species of animals to humans, must be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the mutants could be the reservation host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological nest with the mutants, through murder or carbon mining.
Secondly, panic attacks could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been introduced.
People commit the virus through slaughter and consumption of dog meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both the mutants and the pancakes.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating the crossing of the species' barriers.
First, their exchange rates are relatively high in the RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary ARN viruses, estimated exchange rates of coronavirus may be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the adaptation phase of Coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclear reading test resulting in extremely high mutations and attenuation or, even, invisibility.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue redisivir eliminates the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonclease and ARN polymerase dependent on ARN.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are nearly a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the change rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be expected that it has already been adapted to another guest near mankind.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the miners.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic derivative makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 quickly lose their effectiveness.
Secondly, the long-term RNA gene of coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the gene for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of inter-species evolution, which contributes to the emergence of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are met.
This is supported by the single open reading frames and the functions of the proteins encoded to the genome direction 3'.
Thirdly, coronaviruses vary randomly and frequently during the replication of ARN through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest acting as a blend vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of the coronavirus ARN.
ARN of full and subgenomial lengths highly homologous can be combined to generate new coronavirus.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as SL-CoV mucielago and CV-HKU9 mucielago.
HIV-Hösped interaction related to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that affects transmission between species.
At present, the SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which has also shown positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-COV from humans and animals, it is believed that SARS-COV is experiencing rapid adaptation in different guests, particularly with changes in protein S-Protein RBD.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is carefully selected by the host's anti-body response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in 318-510 amino acids in S1 fragment, which is linked to the human ACE2 and its viral input receptors.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the receptors of ACE2 from several animals, including musculoskeletal, civet, rat and dog map, which allows transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human andcivet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them were found on the grounds of union to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-COV of Civets has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of spicing protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit S implies that affinity of protein S with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a study of electronic chriomicroscope points to 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this union compared to the human ECE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correction might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also joins the ECE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transmission from species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reserve hosts of human coronaviruses, such as muslims, dromedians and rotors, could constitute a barrier to the transmission of species.
Human coronaviruses should use the host dependant factors and subsidize the host restriction factors in order to ensure that transmission between species is successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-huésped interaction must still be identified and characterised.
It could result in an objective study of the full genome of the dependency and restriction factors of the host for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology.
The appearance of new human coronavirus: we are separated from zero
The diversity of coronaviruses of mucous membranes provides many opportunities for the appearance of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, musculoskeletal coronaviruses act as the genetic aperture of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new species of protein codifiers has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered to be important in human adaptation, as there have been isolates of SARS-CoV-related mutants, but it has been determined that different ORF8 proteins are codified.
There was a elimination of 29 characteristics of SARS-CoV in isolated branches at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible previous combinations with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in the ARN-dependent polymerase ARN.
Recombinations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemiological MERS-CoV has suffered combination events between different lines, which occurred in drummers in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recommended with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structured species.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genes, which is most likely to release the virus from the screening pressures carried out, for example by the host immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype layer due to a elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an infected ORF4 virus related to HCoV-229E can be observed, alpacas alfacoronavirus presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, resulting in a frame change.
Finally, although not least important, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also driven by the selection pressure in its reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when caronavirus musculoskeletal infections were detected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and musculoskeletal.
The musculoskeletals seem to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflamatory response in mucous membranes effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mucielagos is deleted due to the positive regulation of the inhibitor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules of the greater Histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of oxygen reactive species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of the mucous membranes could eliminate the replication of coronavirus and affect the read-on of exorriboneclease, resulting in the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by combination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not possible that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservation guests, such as musculoskeletal and camel.
They respond energeticly without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this, the secrets explain why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivity of immune response and cytokines, while the stronger the immune response is, the more serious the pulmonary damage.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in the mutants.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in the temporary phase of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in the mucous membranes is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although there has been a beta-coronavir of mucielagos that shares a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of mucielagos that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that the citizens and other animals of the markets host identical viruses to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronavirus has been found to be highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the pangolins could act as one of the intermediate guests or that betacoronaviruses of pangolins could produce gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still questionnaires, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
Coronavirus has recovered protagonism due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in musculoskeletal and other animals has profoundly changed our understanding of the importance of zoonoses and animal reserves of human coronavirus in human transmission.
There has been ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were created in the mutants and transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and animals on the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civilians in them could have been effective to prevent the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, the bananas should be removed from the wet markets in order to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several lines of betacoronavirs of bananas closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pancakes and other mammals remains to be delucated in future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the drummers for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with the markets of wild animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent further outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they are moving in wild condition.
In particular, musculoskeletal coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are great possibilities for these zoonoses to evolve and combine, which would lead to the appearance of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of feeding wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although mutants have many features that promote the spread of viruses, human contact with mutants and other wild species can be minimised if they are trained to avoid them.
The continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecologicality of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological nichos of the natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
Several pieces of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
Firstly, if the musculoskeletals transmit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral virus to the pancakes, it will be interesting to analyze what circumstances the musculoskeletal and pangolons might share the same ecological nest.
Secondly, if the mutants have a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the mutants.
Thirdly, if a third mammifer acts as the actual guest medium, it must be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, muslims and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a musculoskeletal, pangolin or other mammifer, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will highlight the evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of the "supported houses" and "confirmed houses" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our directive and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for "supposed case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh edition) published by the National Committee of Health of the People ' s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick counselling guide published online at Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
He's been attracted to a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Committee for the Health of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed significantly.
Now, our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
Its work has added new evidence for our direction and is also a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support its important work and express our gratitude.
However, its work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological events with two points of clinical manifestations to carry out an extensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be performed if there are no clear epidemiological events:
Epidemiological events: (1) travel events or residence in Wuhan City and the arid areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) prior contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) contact reports with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City and adhesion areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the appearance of symptoms; (4) events of contact with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases of fever with fluorine-coV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) encounters with patients with mild to moderate levels of fever or symosis in the city of Wuhan, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms; (4) events of contact with confirmed case groups (≥2 cases with confirmed cases, such as those with febriles, 2 cases of fevers, and symosas, symosas, cymosas, and symosamosamosas, comas, comas, comas, comas, comas, comas, soris, or soris, or soris soris,
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of infection by COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells showing normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte content at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with any pathogenic or serologic evidence in the following way: (1) test of reaction in the true-time polymerase chain for SARS-CoV-2; (2) follow-up of the complete viral gene showing high homogeneity to the new recognized coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM and specific IgG body against SARS-CoV-2 in a soil test; or a change of the specific IgG anti-SARRS-CoV-2 positive anti- positive anti- positive, or an increase in title ≥4 times in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the test of reaction in the field of real-time polymerase to detect nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serologic tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us that we need to be careful with asymptomatic and atypical symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flow diagrams should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will arise and ask the readers to send their comments.
For the diagnosis of "speech case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and fulfilling the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our direction in an appropriate way to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday because of COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Investigation (IEDCR) reported that the number of cases registered infected included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
At an online information session, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic COVID-19.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the missing was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was serving at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video release online, the Minister for Transport by Road and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than expected initially, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical, fuel and food supplies, was still permitted.
The first cases recorded by COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men who returned from Italy and also one of the women.
By March 19, these three had already been recovered.
More than one million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The tsunami took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without infection by coronavirus.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-fourth hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronary infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of disease.
The Thursday, Sergei Sobayinin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's closure until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against vote.
Saudi Arabia extended its stay in the holy cities La Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, only the stay took place between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a dropout rate between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia are lowering the thresholds of hygienic paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles were lowering their purchase thresholds for two and a transaction package in all the country's supermarkets, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the pages of the chain Facebook.
It was reported that consumers were being provided for the COVID-19 in the event that people had to be self-adjusted.
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper to deliver home to a package by request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Colles, in his press release on 8 March, reported that, with the use of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still cover the product within an hour of delivery", and said that the request "did not have priors", while ALDI, in a publication on Facebook on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
The sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to Woolworths' voice.
The Costa supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To ease further the shortage, Cole requested larger packages to suppliers and increased the frequency of deliverys, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made available for a special supply of planned thousands.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retaliators Association, said that minorities are trying to increase the existence, but the restrictions on local assembly on truck delivery schedules make it difficult to do so.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet the demand, and less tenders.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offers of Wednesdays.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that supermarkets provide the existence all night long.
He stressed that the hygienic role is a massive article, which causes a low number of existences in numbers, and when it is completed, it leaves a wide space empty in the stanzas, which intensifyes the feeling of loss.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there were a lot of articles in the stanzas, if products such as hygienic and disinfectant roles could [be purchased] and have large quantities, probably the panic would be minimised, Russell Zimmerman said by ABC News.
The recyclable hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap told the past Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleneex's hygienic paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the news.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered the first bidder free of charge, when they were less late because the buyers had free time at the end of the long week of the Workers' Day.
The edition of NT News Thursday, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page booklet designed to cut and use as a hygienic paper.
Supermarkets at the outset were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia of 3 March, in which they said they did not have plans to impose restrictions on the purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday afternoon, it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andre's hygienic paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares Pandemic of COVID-19
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, it is not as dangerous as the specific cases, WHO stressed the need to motivate Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, try, trace, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of spread and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Control and Prevention Centres in the United States, the pandemic “has no precedents”.
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from appearance to continuous global propaganda."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying, "Never before have we seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arises after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergys and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the crime, "in conclusion, it will improve."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4400 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019–20 is a disease-related pandemic by Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The bridge was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Public health emergency of international importance was declared on 30 January 2020 and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths were reported as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the rate of literacy per case is 4% in China, while at world level it is estimated to be between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms is usually from about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth with a toss, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-assessment of people who are suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, forty-five, landings, risk controls at the workplace and closures of facilities.
The pandemic has led to a serious global socio-economic change, the post-marketing or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread lack of supplies that have been reduced by the purchases motivated by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4% of the world's student population.
Error information about the virus was spread over the Internet, and there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, others of East and South-East Asian descent and other areas with significant virus cases.
As a result of the reduction in the travel and closures of the heavy industry, a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions has been observed.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) informed a group of cases of unknown causes, and an investigation began early in January 2020.
The cases, in most of them, were related to the master maritime market in Huanan, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to the coronavirus of the mucielagus, the coronavirus of the panaulins and the SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first person who was suspected of showing symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the last group of the market moved.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were determined to have a market link.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that, on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person in the province of Hubei could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, decreased in China but had recently increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had first exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported in young people, and 19-year-olds and minors represented 2.4% of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom's main scientific adviser, believed that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons subjected to COVID-19 tests and obtained a positive result confirmed under official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had performed more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to perform tests in persons with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March considered that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for the COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Control and Prevention Centres determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 will be recovered.
For those who do not, the time spent from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths were for persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had preexisting diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death records by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to missing persons who gave positive results in the COVID trial, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to the COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not be included in people who have failed the test, for example in their homes, in the homes of elders, etc.
Part of Italy's data revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death record by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A voice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is a sub-assessment", a statement sponsored by the anecdotic subcontinent reports in the United States. This sub-assessment is common in pandemics, such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first deaths outside continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first deaths outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside of continental China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica. In general, several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to the region and with time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, the time passed from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the worldwide proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) by 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms occurring from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the rate of fatality per case, reflecting the percentage of people diagnosed who have fallen due to a disease, and the rate of lethargy by infections, reflecting the percentage of infections (diagnosed and undiagnosed) that have disappeared due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the rate of letality for pandemic infections in total is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the rate of lettality by case.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the brake are inverted and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated, "Infectious fractures, if not controlled, are generally stabilized and then begin to decrease when the disease remains without guests available.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
Chief medical adviser to the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, claimed that "may end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be moving, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study of the Imperial College directed by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until there is a vaccine (maybe 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "may become a station disease, which occurs every year."
The virility of recovery would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and your dry (68%).
The less frequent symptoms include fatigue, respiratory tract production (flamm), loss of the meaning of the olfato, lack of air, muscle pain and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, vomiting, hemops, diarrhoea or cianosis. WHO claims that approximately one of the six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in awakening and blue in the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended before these symptoms occur. The major advance of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, researchers therefore advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with infected persons in order to eliminate the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people are slightly less than 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more often it is from 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of olfatity at the beginning was 30% and then decreased by 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur in tossing, drying or talking; the close contact is considered to be a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, without covering the mouth the rubbers can be moved from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. respiratory drops can also be produced during the analysis, even when speaking, although generally the virus is not transmitted by air.
The gouts can enter the mouth or nose of the people who are near or, possibly, into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubate and cardiopulmonary re-imamination (RCP), may cause respiratory secretion and therefore air propagation.
You can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the eyes, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although promotion may be possible before symptoms and in more advanced stages of disease occur.
People have had positive results in the disease tests up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms are developed.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, in general, one person is infected with another two or three.
In particular, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cartridge and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed in males and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that might have affected infected persons.
Coronavirus 2 of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which first isolated three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with jabone, which dissolves its protective environment. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zootic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genotype betacoronavirus, its subgeneral sarbecovirus (line B) together with two stems derived from the mucielago.
At the level of the complete genome, 96 % is identical to other vertebral coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between the vaccine virus and human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete gene indicated that the coronavirus of the pans and SARS-CoV-2 shares, as a maximum, 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pansoles are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, in the last instance, it is confirmed by the reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secrets or by computerized Tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan that compared the reaction in the polymerase chain to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in the polymerase chain, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and neurons.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "do not use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the reaction in the polymerase chain with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in blood samples or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
In general, this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal hypothesis, although a gestation can also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be sufficiently accurate as to approve their generalised use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories alone.
The characteristic features in the images of computerized radiographs and tomography (TC) of symtomatic people include ovaries in glass delusted asymmetrical peripherals and missing pulmonary wastes.
The Italian Radiology Society is completing an international database on online results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to the superposition with other infections such as adenavirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by reaction in the polymerase chain has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study conducted in China compared the results of computerized torax to those of the polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that, although diagnosis by images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convulsive neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, with radiographs and computerized Tomographs.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining a good general personal hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands without washing them before, and pulling or touching on a dissociating garment and pulling the finger directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a public surgical mask.
It is also recommended that physical distance measures be taken to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel from and towards countries and areas affected by the scourge.
However, the virus has reached the Community promotion phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how it was infected. It is recommended that medical care providers who visit someone who might be infected take the standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. The tracking of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent more transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments with this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to require limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on private solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave a positive answer in the COVID-19 test. They are circling wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and oral injection garages are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have visible dirty hands; before eating and after breathing the nose, towels or towels.
This is due to the fact that, outside of the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with jabone, which decomposes its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when no water and soap are available.
WHO recommends people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (in one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on an stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and povidone yodded at 0.2–7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorethidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or store, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, tactics, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cassettes used by the sick.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with the flexible code or with a dissociable to towel or toss, and that they wash their pants immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, since the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance used by the respiratory gutters scattered in speech, drying and tossing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Useing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without adequate hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, CDC recommended the use of non-medicines made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of detached medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact with other people (1 metres (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or to be in competitive places.
Thailand's health officials recommend that people make cloth masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited access to public spaces without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask when in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government required the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of masks per day since mid-March, on 1 April demanded the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses.
Panama imposed compulsory use of masks to free air, while also recommending the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
The masks have also been used generally in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying at their homes, restricting travel, avoiding competitive areas, using health forms that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many Governments now require or recommend social distance in areas affected by the scourge.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced to 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two persons. Adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune systems are more likely to suffer from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends that they remain in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the scourge. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to make it clear that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections is virtually or virtual.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encourage them to remain in contact with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
It includes recommendations only to have sexual relations with a person who lives with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
It was recommended that self-assessment in the home of those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspected of having been infected was recommended.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on adequate self-restraint, and many Governments have requested or recommended self-care for entire populations in the affected areas.
The strictest self-care instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with a generalised transmission are advised to make self-careful for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies to control a crime are containment or removal and mitigation.
In addition to introducing other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population, it is intended to identify and isolate infected persons.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigating phase: measures are taken to prevent the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be adopted at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part to control the outbreak of an infectious disease involves attempting to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as planning the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk that health services collapse and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the crime include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-care; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass competition events; Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental and surface cleaning measures. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the crime once its seriousness was evident, for example, the implementation of forty-ones in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized forty-ones, and issued warnings on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected people who decided to commit suicide and imposed large sums of money on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and punished the accumulation of medical supplies. The simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigating (which reduces the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppressing (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimistic mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and deaths in the middle, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
It may be preferred to remove, but it should be maintained throughout the lifetime that the virus is circulating in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), because, on the contrary, transmission is reacting rapidly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to remove the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing of existing drugs.
Taking medicines free of charge for the refrigerator, drinking liquids and relaxing can help relieve the symptoms.
According to severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may improve the results.
Several components that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "homes and traditional homes" may alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adaptation of medical attention to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for primary medical care hospitals and services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolate positive patients from COVID-19 and increasing the capacity of intensive care through staff training and the increase in the number of respiratory and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (the called zero patient) could have originated.
The first case known as the new coronavirus can be resumed on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the largest maritime market in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of unforeseeable causes were observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan's CD on December 27.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police accused eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, of spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was arrested by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
At the beginning of January, enough cases of uninformed causation had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan as to initiate an investigation. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread to other Chinese provinces, which contributed to migration by the New Year of China and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data show that, by 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have disappeared and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as house-to-house orders, asylum orders or detention) and detention incidents. On April 2, around 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, are in some kind of detention in the United States, more than 50 million people are in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in detention in South Africa, and 1300 million people are in India.
On 26 March, 1700 million people around the world were in some kind of detention, which increased to 2600 million people two days later, around the third part of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was referred to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case took place on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown group of cases of pneumonia, and his hospital informed the CDC of Jianghan of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic testing of patients samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
The WHO was informed the same day.
While these reports were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan to "disperse noises" on the bridge.
The Chinese National Health Commission stated at the outset that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a dramatic campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in the history of humanity", on 23 January, a health cord was announced that prohibited travel inside and outside Wuhan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
New Chinese Year celebrations (January 25th) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conventions and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the release of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival wound.
Universitys and schools were also closed throughout the country.
Hong Kong and Macao regions have implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures have been established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of public movement was implemented in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some type of restrictions on free air exits. After the beginning of the global phase of the crime in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quota for all international passengers entering the city. On 23 March, only a case had been transmitted at national level in China in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, China's first minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the propaganda of cases transmitted at national level was essentially blocked and that the scourge had been controlled in China.
On the same day, the travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, were flexible. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permit from 28 March would be suspended without specific details of when this policy would be finalised.
Those who want to enter China should request visas from Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic incentives for firms. The State Council declared a day of struggle to begin with a three-minute national silence on April 4th at 10:00, in line with Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their respect online to comply with the physical distance in order to avoid the withdrawal of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the health body of the country reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesús Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu since Wuhan were the source of the scourge.
On 22 February, of the 9336 followers of the church, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared maximum alert.
More than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases remained in custody after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers gave positive results for the virus.
The hours of the airlines were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the most comprehensive and best organized program in the world to test the virus in the population and isolate infected persons, as well as identify and identify those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included the mandatory self-reporting of the symptoms by people recently arrived from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available on the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the scourge despite not adopting the quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society at first was polarized in relation to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon's destruction for what they considered a wrong way of handling the crime by the Government, or well, to commend their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases on a day less than four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all newly arrived outside must remain in custody for two weeks.
According to the media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for the testing of 121 different countries.

Iran has appointed five billion reals to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to place the areas affected by the scourge, and that it would be only for people to care.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although the heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Year's Press Nowruz continued.
The temples in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a center of spread of the virus after China.
Among the claims of a discovery of the magnitude of the crime in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran for 28 February, which indicated that the magnitude of the crime could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government for that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported that they had obtained positive results in the testing of the virus.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the scourge in Italy was confirmed when two Chinese tourists gave a positive response to the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.

A group of non-related cases of COVID-19 was subsequently identified, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to contain the offence, which included the placing in custody of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy of a large population of advanced age and capacity to test all people with the virus up to date could contribute to the high level of literacy.
The United Kingdom's response to the first virus emerged as one of the most vulnerable countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any social distance measures or massive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism from the apparent lack of speed and intensity in response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he had neglected social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people should work from their homes as soon as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure facilities, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' salaries to a limit of 2500 GBP per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the first Minister announced measures of stricter social distance, which prohibited meetings of more than two people and restricted free travel and activities to those considered strictly necessary.

WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004 when it accused the Chinese secretarial authorities that prevented the efforts to prevent and contain, and the current crisis, in which the Central Government "has provided periodic updates to prevent panic among New Moon soldiers".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, although "expectedly not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "an important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it was not prior to the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission of human beings out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance (SPII), the sixth ESPII since the first time the measure was introduced during the influenza pandemic in 2009.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the ESPII was due to "the risk of global proliferation, especially for low and medium-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessary to interfere with international trade and travel" and that "OMS does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the world community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the need to support those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who have been infected with the virus, if any".
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are just as strong as our weakest sword" and urged the international community to "invert or pay more in the future". On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to bring “the full power of the United Nations system in response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was set up, which allowed coordination of all United Nations response, which, according to WHO, would allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies could provide their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development consequences of crime".
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and to assess "the severity and communicableness of disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with key institutions at the national level and to make visits to the place to assess "impact of response activities at provincial and county level, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus", and noted that, although it was still very ready to call it a pandemic, the countries should be "in a preparatory phase".
In response to a developmental outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global threat by coronavirus would be "high" to "very high", its highest alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments of the planet: they are emerging.
This virus can be on its way and we must be ready," stressing that appropriate responses could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not ensure that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and he pointed out that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared pandemic outbreak of coronavirus.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction". WHO has received important criticisms as a result of what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 persons on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts indicated that everyone has the right to interventions to save lives and that the Government has this responsibility.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts pointed out that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detained persons, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, through his pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were asked because of their efforts in relation to quarantine in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the scourge in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, denied prior recognition of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories on the origin of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and it stated that "China's censorship has now been a virus that has become a global pandemic", which has been identified by some critics as racism and "distrac [distrac] failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a strategy of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and called the strategy "All About China".
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Communications such as Political, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's external policy representative, Joseph Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to raise its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, it had sent assistance to these two last countries.
On 3 April, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of refusing assistance to other countries to their own country.
And disputes have been reported with regard to masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has built hundreds of breathers for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided that the Russian army would send military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or low-use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of committing an offensive "goopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The president of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the periodic reports and expressed his appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "when offering help to US colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when US manufacturers of materials and medical equipment cover impulse, they can also correspond if necessary."
The planned military exercise of NATO "Dedefender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the most major NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will take place on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two hundred members of Parliament infected, as well as five other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, saying that his country is having difficulties in combating the scourge because of lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The scourge prompted the requirement that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family license and higher levels of funds for public health.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea had increased due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive efforts" after Japan announced that any person from South Korea would be in quarantine for two weeks at sites designated by the Government.
South Korea's society was initially polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to require Moon's destruction for which they considered an abuse of the government, or well, to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that Governments could strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, its Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree in an unlimited manner, suspends Parliament and the elections and punishes those who are considered to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
It was responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus in several cases of supply shortage, as a result of the increased use of equipment worldwide to combat outbreaks, panic-induced purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Medicines Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to the greatest demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also presented panic-induced purchases that left the standing vacuumes of essential products, such as food, hygiene paper and emboxed water, which caused the lack of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic products shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in four to six months stay in the supply of medical products.
It also caused a lack of personal protection teams around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a lack of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas have been affected by the acute food shortage.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful and have avoided a serious shortage of food that has been anticipated in Europe and North America.
The north of Italy, with its major agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to sector representatives.
Food stalls were only temporary holidays, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released grain reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 because of the measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral fracture has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could overcome those of the SARS outbreak from 2002 to 2004.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 million in world supply chains that could last for up to two years.
According to the report, the Petroleum Exporting Organization (OPEC) remained "resurrection" after a strong fall in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, world values markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several U.S. bourgeoisie indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced fall since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indexes ended the week with less than 10%.
On 28 February, Skopje Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions were again based on the fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are responding faster than they have responded to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel to any part of the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lowest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kantas, while British regional Flybe airport collapsed.
The impact in the cross-border sector has never reached a level before.
Several railway stations and shipper terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important period of travel related to the New Year's wounded.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's Festivals, while private companies also independently closed their tourist shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Year’s Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the prohibited City of Beijing and traditional festivals of the temples.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's wound until 10 February, and ordered that most workplaces not be reopened until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of country exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled their New Year's celebrations. The minority sector was affected worldwide, with reductions in hours of attention or temporary closure.
The visits to minorities in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Minorists in North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a 33 to 43% decline in the oil transit to commercial centres in March compared to February.
Operators from commercial centres around the world have launched additional measures, such as hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America who had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million migrant rural workers in China were displaced in their homes in the provinces of the interior or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the San Luis Federal Reserve Bank. The detention in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. About 900 000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the imprisonment began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidised by the Government, known as Kurzworking, to their employees.
The German short-term working compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The sectors of secular arts and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, around the world.
The organizations of the culture and art sector tried to carry out their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public and to support artists when possible.
For March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibitions and other cultural institutions have been permanently closed, and their exhibitions, events and exhibitions have been canceled or postponed.
In response, great efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence and increasing to an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion discrepancies.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian prison period of the Quaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Sundays; some churches have offered religious services via radio, live via the Internet or television, while others offer places to pray from the car.
After the Roman Catholic Diocese decided to close its churches and chapels and with the Plaza de San Pedro empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public concentration in churches, mosques, churches, churches, temples and guillotines.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of the plegaries of the Fridays in the areas affected by the scourge and subsequently closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or post-posted, including the UEFA Championships League 2019-20, the First League 2019-20, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The bridge interrupted the 2020 Olympic Games plans, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "reprogramm for a later date by 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gambling sites around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or canceled.
This has caused many depositors to access the Internet, many online gambling sites have reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, several musical groups have suspended or cancelled concerts.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work via the Internet as an alternative to the show in traditional life, such as live live performances of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet so that artists can interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, a number of Internet memes were distributed on the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the collapse of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and to people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been seen in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia and the Pacific.
February reports (when most cases were still limited in China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese were worthy of the virus or that they were receiving what they considered to be a fair repressive.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both online and outside.
Following the progress of the scourge towards new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country that experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed applications to prevent Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend in Twitter.
China, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, has reported higher levels of racist insult, as well as aggression.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics viewed as racist and ancient.
Manifests in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the north-east of India, who share a border with China, and who are studying in the main Indian cities, suffered hunger in relation to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unity of the Bharatiya Janata party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed the nature and "that is why God had defeated them".
The Chinese consular in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "errones". In China, xenophobic and racism increased to non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and it was described to foreigners as a "foreign waste" and intended for "despair".
Many periodicals with payment walls removed them for parts or the entire coverage of coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have published scientific articles related to the patent available with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results with pre-pressive servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the test of reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase, which detects the ARN of coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the ARN of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
Anti-body tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise rate of mortality of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
By 23 March, no country had performed more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were major variations in the number of tests carried out in the different countries.
This variable is also likely to have a significant impact on the rates of flexibility for reported cases, which are likely to be very high in some countries.
Through the reaction chain of the polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hesopharyngeals or spout samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The test of reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase performed with hisopathic pharyngeals only is reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In persons infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory pathways by means of a suction catheter, or the material released to the torser (spute).
One of the first polymerase chain reactions was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcripts (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a detection kit from SARS-CoV-2 based on the response chain of the clinical degree polymerase (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency approval of the National Administration of Medical Products of China of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the response to the polymerase chain. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic response panel in the chain of polymerase with real-time reverse transcripts for the new Coronavirus 2019 (19-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagan Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reactivities, and an impact on the implementation of tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the two-components tests was not determined until 28 February 2020, and from then on only the State and local laboratories were allowed to perform tests.
The Food and Medicines Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on the response in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, this Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at national level.
No limit was made to the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in the system m2000 of Abbott; FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hological, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cephed was also authorised to use the FDA emergency for a test that lasts about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isotermic amplification technology of nuclear acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a number of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal body that is specifically attached to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as soon as a test for influence.
In March 2020, the publication review concluded that "Torax radiographs have a low diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
The typical features in the TC include bilateral multiple-opacities in glass illustrated with peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domains are developed, impeding pattern and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the reaction in the polymerase chain was compared to computerized Tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in the polymerase chain, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and neurons.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first line test for diagnosis of COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs have recommended the reaction in the polymerase chain as initial examination.
Part of the immune system response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine the immunity and monitoring of the population. Analysis can be carried out in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
The automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories can carry out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood species is generally used, although serial species can be used to follow the immune response.
For the tests at the point of attention, a single blood sample is usually obtained by puncture in the skin.
Unlike the response methods in the polymerase chain, no extraction step is required before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities to notify the agency as appropriate and can therefore now distribute its anti-body tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epipe Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in the blood samples.
The ability to carry out tests is of several hundred samples over time and is therefore much faster than conventional evidence of reaction in the viral ARN chain.
The antibodies can generally be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the test kits he bought were as good as for use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspect patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for inspection", the patient skips into the tube, sends it and receives a short-term result. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyse suspected cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient is infected if he goes to the hospital or needs to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the trials in driving-through centres for COVID-19 suspects, a health professional takes samples with appropriate precautions.
The driving-through centres have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Healthy Doctors said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the ambulance environment and that 10 700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance covers costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to perform 160 000 tests a week.
On 19 March, testing was provided through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been analysed, including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9 %) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Institute of Technion and the Rambam Hospital developed and tried a method to analyse samples of 64 patients simultaneously, consisting of grouping samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample was positive. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened an emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (fire: fire, or more than 1000 samples of E.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the cost of coping with the quarantine had been doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjün, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 evidence per day. Multiplexed open-source designs provided by analysis origami were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
In March, the lack and insufficient amounts of assets affected massive evidence in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore samples preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now doing more testing of coronavirus per person in their population than any other country, and it was intended to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the Group 42 and BGI population (which was based on their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the ability to perform tens of thousands of responses in the polymerase chain with reverse transcripts per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Various test formulas have been developed that address different parts of the gene profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for producing kits that sent low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the crime, and these countries and Australia could not provide sufficient kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts on evidence.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea's evidence has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its ability to carry out tests, especially in private sector laboratories, over a number of years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays in hundreds of thousands of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supplies of hesopathic and chemical agents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained significant results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would withdraw the kits that had stolen the wrong results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China produced incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits in China that were worthless.
First Minister Matovic suggested that they were thrown into Danube. Atesh Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and did not "appropriate them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they did not serve.
The implementation of tests, complemented by a quarter of those who obtained positive results and the identification of persons who had contacted positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of evidence throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
About half of the people who obtained positive results did not have symptoms, and all the cases detected were reported.
With restrictions on travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from the outside, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has advanced much earlier than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and minority establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to recommend residents staying in their homes on 28 March, but schools were reopened shortly after the wound on 23 March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from the outside, testing and quarantine, but with less strict restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, relative to the number of deaths, have lower literacy rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who only have mild or non-serious symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the country's test policy.
A country that only carries out tests in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as a percentage of evidence than a country that carries out tests in all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action to wash hands with a view to eliminating suction, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
Hand washing with japanese constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosal membranes).
The five critical moments during the day on which it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a child’s neck or changing clothes, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with censorship. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the narcissing, tossing, or drying.
After touching animals, food for animals or wastes.
Medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical attention may prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) from their hands and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; and reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality in children at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheic diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate by almost 50 % by these diseases.
Interventions promoting hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes in approximately one third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be related to the washing of hands with jabon. Hand washing with jabone is the most effective and economic way of preventing diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour in homes, schools and communities all over the world.
Neumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives are covered by an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia combined represent nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with jabone before eating and after using bathrooms in a heated habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the deaths by day and half the deaths by acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetitiveness, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance may cause skin damage due to skin resurgence.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can cause a Cutanian affection that causes picazone and makes the skin become famous as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of the complex obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with jabone is important to reduce the oral-fecial transmission of the diseases: after using the bath (orar, defecate), after cleaning a child’s neck (change of clothes), before feeding a child, before eating and/or preparing or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions in which a right washing technique should be used to prevent transmission of diseases include before and after handling a cut or wound; after drying, drying or swallowing the nose; after touching wastes of animals or handling animals; and after touching waste.
In many countries, there is a low washing rate with apples.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hand washing with jabon. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had a higher rate of 97%; the United States was about half of 77%; and China had the lowest rate of 23%. Currently, there are several methods for changing behaviors, to increase the use of hands with jabon at critical times. Hand washing in children's school groups at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing in children's behavior.
The essential health care programme implemented by the Philippines Department of Education is an example of action to promote the health and education of children.
To disappear twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of skin microorganisms improves by adding jabones or detectors to the water.
The main action of jabeans and detectors is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
The solid apple, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid japanese bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are attached to the foam.
However, the CDC claims that "the liquid apple with disposal controls that do not involve the use of the hands is preferable".
Antibacterial jabeans have been actively promoted for a conscious public of health.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics are used to store antibiotics resistant by nature.
However, antibacterial jabeans contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial jabeans do not preserve the resistant strains of antibiotics, they may not be as effective as it is promoted.
In addition to the surface agent and which protects the skin, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditions for skin (green oil, vitamins, mental, vegetal extracts). An extensive analysis of the public health school of the University of Oregon indicated that common jabons are as effective as the antibacterial jabons for the consumer as they contain triclosan to prevent disease and eliminate the bacteria from the hands.
The hot water to wash hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, the tubing water is more effective than the cold brown water to eliminate natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using tibia water has no effect on the reduction of the microbian load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, hygiene agents for non-water and alcohol to fertilize (also known as an alcohol-based solution, antiseptic solution for hand milling or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
The majority is based on isopropylic alcohol or ethanol formulated with a heavy agent as a carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moistureant as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol yield.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95% of alcohol at least eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to freeze eliminate bacteria, bacteria resistant to several medicines (SARM and ERW), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and honey.
Alcohol-based disinfectants that contain 70 % of alcohol remove 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logirats, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria in 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logirats) of bacteria in 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagionous gastroenteritis. A sufficient solution for antiseptic or alcohol-based agents should be used to freeze or cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the outers of all fingers, are broken for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the foam or the gel are dried.
The fingertips should also be washed well, milling them in both palm trees. The U.S. Control and Disease Prevention Centres recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants wash their hands, especially when their hands are visiblely dirty.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on its ease of use and the rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, it should not be used as a substitute for adequate hand washing unless water or japanese is available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may be obtained by the skin, unless emulsifiers or hydraters are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by glycerin or other emulsifiers in the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emulsifiers caused a irritation and dry skin significantly lower than antimicrobial jabones or receptors.
The allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or the additives present in alcohol-based solutions are very rare.
The smaller tendency to cause irritant dermatitis by contact was attractive compared to washing hands with water and jaboon.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and formula, in addition to historically, has been much less than alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to feed.
More recently, the formula used for benzalconic chloride has been found to have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to buy apples and use them in exchange for jeans or land.
The cenics or the earth can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than apples.
One concern is that if soil or cenics are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease them.
Like the jabon, the censor is also a disinfectant agent, as, in contact with water, forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using censorship or arena as an alternative to apple when there is no apple.
The correct manual washing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases to prevent transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with running water hot or cold.
The current water is recommended because containers with dried water can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Wash your hands to form a sponge with a generous amount of jabone, including your hands' dorsal, between your fingers and below your cheeks.
The jabone removes skin germs, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more casually when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps to eliminate skin germs, and restricting over longer periods removes more germs.
Swimming well with current water.
Injecting into a container may recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or dry in the air.
The hands wet and mowed again are more easily contaminated. The most frequently forgotten parts are the thumb, the mussel, the areas between the fingers and below the cheeks.
Artificial veins and disassembled veins can accommodate microorganisms.
It is often recommended that we prevent the spread of hands; dry skin may cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no current water or jabone, for example, water being poured out from a bedbed or a cable with suitable sources or use censorship if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "home flues" and other economic options.
A home flu is a simple technology consisting of using a suspended jar of a soybean and a foot-acted palm to see a small amount of water on the hands and a barge.
The effective hand drying is an essential part of the hygiene process, but there is a certain debate on the most effective drying in public bathrooms.
More and more are the research that indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the association of the European Tissue Symposium Paper Tolls Industry to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper Tolls, Hot Air dryers, and more modern air screw dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by 194 per cent on the fingernails and 254 per cent on the palms.
Securing with the air-cracker resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42% in fingernails and 15% in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingernails and 77% in the palm trees. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-cracker, which aired from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to sleep the micro-organisms of the hands and unit and potentially pollute other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air separator has promoted microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper tolls did not show significant promotion of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial account after hand drying:
There are many hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfecting towels for hands is an alternative during travel, when no water or soap is available.
The alcohol-based disinfectant must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The washing of the hands of doctors became mandatory much after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff who wash their hands when they forget.
A study tested a reduction in the rates of infection with its use.
The washing of the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and japanese or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
The hands should be restricted together by interlinking the fingers.
If there are residues under the ovens, a cherries can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated by these surfaces again.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate and prevent pathogenous microorganisms ("germen").
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood flow related to catheter infections in 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the washing of hands and washing of standard hands in medical care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's manual for manual hygiene can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Trade devices can measure and verify the hygiene of their hands, if required to demonstrate compliance with the rules.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before asymptic work and
after treating patients. The combination of antiseptic chemicals in the japanese (a "medical" or "antibacterial") gives you the possibility of elimination to the hand washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before a surgery or in surroundings where the antibiotics are very common. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to count with a flu that can be opened and closed without touching hands, a little chlorohexidine or iodine for washing, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterilized skin to cool and other sterilized instrument to clean up under the walls.
All the toys should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forwards up to the bottom, generally, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When injecting, it must be avoided that the water of the pretebrations returns to their hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized bread and put on a surgical bag.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use an antiseptic before and after treating sick people.
In order to control the infections caused by staphylcococci in hospitals, it has been verified that the maximum benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of wash and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
The washing with common apple results more from the triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to foods compared to the washing with antibacterial apple. When comparing the washing of hands with an alcohol based solution with the washing of hands with an antibacterial apple for an average period of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the frotate with alcohol reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26 % more than the antibacterial apple.
However, water and japanese are more effective to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and Clostridium’s spores difficult of hands than those of alcohol-based disinfectants. Interventions to improve the hygiene of hands in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of disinfectant for hands based on alcohol and written and oral reminders.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing is considered to be an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, steam or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal washing habits.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is very little flu to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of renting habits and not the lack of steam or water.
Promoting hand washing with jaboon can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause long-term behavioural changes in the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that Community approaches are effective to increase hand washing in the PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations may be part of the manual washing promotion campaigns that are taking place in order to reduce child disease and mortality.
The World Day of the Manos Lavado is another example of awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the creation of an emio for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting the washing of hands with jabone is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who had just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the middle of the 20th century by two pioneers of manual hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne diseases and health-care-related infections have led to the United States Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases to promote more active hands hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The Portuguese flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with japanese to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, maps were placed with "correct techniques to wash your hands" along with the bathrooms of public bathrooms and bathrooms of offices and airports.
The phrase "handling" is a statement that you do not want to do anything or share the complexity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate laid his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader usage phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary weakness, which represents her guilt over the crimes she had committed and which had led her husband to commit.
It has also been verified that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people have to wash their hands more often than others and have to value the elements for hand washing.
In addition, those people who have been allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensatory actions, such as a volunteer.
Religions recommend washing hands with hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without jabbon, forms part of ritual washing in many religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Tevila and the netillat Yadayim in Judaism, the washing in Christianity and the Jews in Islam. Religions also recommend washing in hygienic hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are forced to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam are forced to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls in the workplace before the COVID-19
Risk control at the workplace before the COVID-19 refers to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk control for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the workplace and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be willing to compete with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Occupational Health (OSHA), job-risk work has a minimum working relationship with the public and working partners, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a clean and clean working environment.
Media exposure risk work includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who do not know or suspect that they have COVID-19 but who may be infected by existing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of people and some large-scale retailing environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective blankets and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19, are at high risk of exposure, which increases very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 brakes can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may lack work because they are sick, because they have to care for others, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in respect of goods and in the means of acquisition of such goods (such as buying in hours that are not spicy, by means of home delivery services or by windscreens from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from the home and community environments and risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic health problems.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingent plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreaks.
Plans for preparation and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of the response to a crime are to reduce transmission among staff members, protect those who are more likely to suffer from adverse health complications, maintain trade operations and minimize the adverse effects of other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located is affected by the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrations and, finally, individual protection teams.
Engineering controls imply that employees are exposed to work-related risks without resorting to the behaviour of workers and may be the most cost-effective way to implement them.
Administrative controls are changes in the policies or working procedures required by the employer or employer.
Individual protection equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of individual protection equipment must be selected according to the danger to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respiratorys), used appropriately and systematically, reviewed frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and cleansed, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), job creation at the risk of exposure has a minimum working relationship with the public and working partners.
Measures to prevent basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent washing of hands, the recommendation to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory hygiene standards that include covering towels and drying, the provision of paper and containers for wastes, the preparation for teleworking or scalding shifts, if necessary, to discourage workers from using tools and equipment and the maintenance of a clean and clean working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with acute respiratory symptoms stay in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medicines to relieve the symptoms or reduce fever; that health licences policies are flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work at the risk of the average exposure includes those who require frequent or close to less than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may have been infected by SARS-COV-2 due to the Community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person has recently made an international journey to a place with a generalised COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, the working environments with a lot of people and some of the risk groups that are staying at home, the engineering controls for this group and the higher-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as the protection coverings of plastics for the maintenance service for which the customer can be required from the car. The administrative controls for this group and the groups of risk include recommending the workers who are staying in the home of a very large minority group.
Workers in this risk group must rarely use breathers.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to visit the sick person and offering him a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper pans when touching or drying.
The cabin crew must use unskilled surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, your persistent or difficulty breathing.
Guantánamo and other waste products should be disposed of in a safe biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruisers and other passenger ships, risk controls include post-posting the journey by disease, auto repair and immediately inform the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centres, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of the Community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other massive meetings, such as physical education classes or choirs or food in the dining room, increasing the space between the pipes, scaling the entrance and exit times, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu-like symptoms.
Where there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Officers of police forces are recommended to contact persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who follow the same rates as emergency medical professionals, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning toilets before re-use them and follow the standard operating procedure for the maintenance and disposal of the personal protective equipment and the maintenance and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morbidity workers are in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high-risk exposure work are those of the delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis.
These become very high exposure risk work if workers carry out aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morning work includes those in which workers are involved in preparing the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they tend to have a very high exposure risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19, even when they are performed by aerosol generation procedures.
The specializing ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical and morgue care environments.
Samples should be manipulated by taking precautions at Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated from if they are suspected or not able to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who carry out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with a filter mask approved by NIOSH or above should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory programme that includes tests of medical adjustments, training and examinations.
Other types of masks can provide more protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of monoprotectors, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, pay attention or transport them without conducting aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, gloves or facial protector, battle and guarantor.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask must be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 breather.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, restricting access to a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those people involved in its direct attention, using the same mask without withdrawing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and slowing down the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

ASSURANCE: [Covid-19] Facilitate the load and prepare us for the future
FECHA/HORA DE ENVIO: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, universal time coordinated
Licence: CC0: No reserved rights
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges presented do not have before them, but we know that our best response is to the empathy, cooperation and overall community building that conforms to the organization's core.
The friendship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people we have the luck to work with.
I couldn't feel more gratitude and pride than all of you were my friends.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to reach Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Its work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites in place, helping our friends to receive their payment or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this coming week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to talk about our approach and our timetable for the next few days and months.
In this debate, we consider what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are dealing with and what would be the best way to maintain the organization's sustainability right now.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce your speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contractors:
our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next week's notice.
We are not declaring a wounded; if you can work in a more normal time, this would be of great benefit to the mission.
However, the world is an indispensable place now, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, buy or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not taking account of their hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although it shouldn't be necessary to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to ask for a sick leave or paid free time; only inform your manager and assist your team to review calendars and timetables to ensure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Bryan of T&C Operations so that T&C can help with support and ensure that the management is in so far as it is in its situation).
People who work for hours will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renewed our commitment to our contractors and staff partners who work on time.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if he is sick and can't work.
If he wants to work, he has our support.
Many people use the work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly graffiti, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we ask of them is that they communicate with their manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There's some things we need to keep doing.
The Trusted Site Engineering Teams, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most important projects.
Reduced speed today won't harm us tomorrow.
We didn't plan to "double the hours to put us into the day" when the pandemic ended.
It will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the PPP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust us to our new reality and expectations of working hours daily, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which devotes more time to the budget so that employees can prioritise critical work, personal care and care for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or wish to work with a reduced time in the coming weeks.
This extension of our chronology greatly reduces current planning and pressure burdens throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and the teams only of confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for its leadership in this situation.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at San Francisco's office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of San Francisco's office.
They used a hospital antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty-care protocol, using products that support the safety of its employees.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the rates shared with San Francisco.
As some of our friends in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still underway, but they may be delayed.
Some of our fellow workers work safely for the first time.
Our former colleagues who have worked in a remote way know that this mode requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of the meetings to intervals of one or two hours as a maximum.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to cut them in the course of several days.
Defines the meeting clearly with a list of topics and sends precipitation reading material.
Use the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Creates a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send an e-mail message to technical support if you need comfortable ears.
Use the refund for refrigerators.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your friends about the shared work
The RR. HH. Operations team is analyzing the ergonomics-based rates based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editors, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could prevent them from carrying out their part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for continuing or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional tariffs in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over interruption and, in part, relief by clarity and capacity to focus on its own communities, both on Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to set up a Meta-Wiki page in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and to follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 h, universal time coordinated 07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer their questions and spend time with each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information about this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these updated pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently very affected.
If you have any question about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything with which you may need help, don’t hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and work as a link when necessary.
If they have confidential or delicate matters, they send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be regarded as leaving our work and our obligations.
Instead, it is a recognition that our work and our obligations are likely to be adapted in a way that had not occurred before.
These are the measures that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and therefore we need to take care of and care for their families so that they can be found in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the team of Leaderrazgo (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 contraindicates the activity of angiotensin-related enzyme (ECA) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic diet for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for certain coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain of renal transporter amino acids of collectin.
ECA2 is a uniform type I membrane protein, with its enzymeally active domain exposed to the surface of lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is excavated from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as Shedasa and, as a result, the solvent protein is released in the blood stream and, ultimately, is eliminated by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is attached primarily to the cell membrane of the lung type II stem cells, to the enterocytes of the lactate intestine, to the venous arterial and endothelial cells and to the blood cells of most organs.
ECA2's MARN expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, the stranded body, the hypothalamus and the encephalic throne.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter ECA.
The ECA excreates the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In addition, ECA2 excreates the amino acid carboxylic terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to form vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Argy-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also eliminate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the trafficking of ammonia-neutral transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the combination of S1 spic protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells has resulted in endocitosis and the transfer of the virus together with the enzyme to endosomes found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the host's TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help to fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory entities have recommended continuing the inhibitor therapy of ECA and the standard BRA .
A review with systematic metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with control cases".
In addition, "the risk ofneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors and who had a greater risk of pneumonia, in particular those with cerebrovascular accident and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the mortality associated with neo-neumonia, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of neo-neumonia."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new treatment for acute pulmonary injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the lechiones with acute respiratory difficulty syndrome caused by lipoliscarids.
The average life of rhECA2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes apart from the 24-hour (duration) effect.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those people with intolerance to the classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (SRA inhibitors) or in the diseases in which the circulatory angiotensin II is found. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulties.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contacts tracking applications.
Private concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to approve these applications based on Bluetooth directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Joy, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore a application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, was launched as an open code application and will be handed over to the government. In northern Macedonia, "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application was launched to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was pending the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government reported that the contact tracking application was in an advanced development phase and that it would be available for its implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application was planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol in Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of the Cambridge University Security Engineering, has raised several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive errors and potential failure if the adoption of the application is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the promotion of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications related to coronavirus in its App Store to "official" or trust organizations alone.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through the use of coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be disintegrated once the threat occurs.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have submitted a communication to require limits to this type of surveillance.
Organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
the monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
monitoring and monitoring extensions should have extension keys;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymous protection should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid excessive discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens should be established to respond to such abuse;
the significant participation of all " relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be required. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporter Sin Fronteras (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published lists of controls.
The proposed plan by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by withdrawing the tracking mechanism of its operational systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based location track was used, rather than applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid the trace.
In Israel, network-based tracking was adopted.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data present potential problems of significant privacy.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been established that use central servers only for communication (see below).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out the tracking of contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking of mobile devices and transaction data with credit cards, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to warn about possible contacts, the Government has also made information on the location available to the public, which is allowed due to major changes in the privacy laws of the information after the MERS breach in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralised and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The trace of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research being re-mounted at least by 2013. By 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on relevant privacy solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both central and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include the decentralised proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for the mobile communication tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data will never leave the device and all fittings will take place on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location data or route intersection to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share delicate location and health data with other users and employees, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly consistent protocols formed the World TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect to achieve broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the Code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official government application.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, companies controlling the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that, as they ensured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
The specifications of the main technologies used in the system were also published.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementation of tools for Governments to create tracking applications for official coronavirus that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the problems of persistent adoption and surveillance by first distributing the system through updates of the operating system and then withdrawing them from the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the re-adaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemicals modulated, each of which has multiple links.
The analysis of these Union sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important daily proteins of SARS-CoV-2, there is the protein similar to the papain, the polymerase ARN directed by ARN, the helicase, the S protein and the ribosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several components of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of its main chain with the most approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study and recommended it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is an anti-paludic drug that is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the related chloroquine and hydrochloroquine would be among the four drugs that would be studied in the clinical trial of Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests in New York state with chlorquin and hydrochloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquine sulphate and chlorquin phosphate by an urgent authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised in accordance with an USA alone as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydrochloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
The doctors have said they use the drug when "no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, great studies are being conducted.
The University of Langone Medicine of NYU is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydrochloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipiravir was clearly effective.
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen had a negative mean of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with neumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was administered to umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is weak and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that he would buy the drug in Japan for his reservations and that he would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where he would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Administration of Trump on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or they try to conceive.
A lopinavir/ritonavir study (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefits have been observed".
Drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a component that is linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease in the scientific community, criticism of resource allocation for the rehabilitation of specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS has emerged.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filviruses, neurovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two hospitals at Cleveland University; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with a more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are being conducted for patients who are hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with azitromicin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
One form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is currently underway and 200 severely hospitalised patients in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing lung inflammation and complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registered to 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Embarrassed women who love or do not have an attractive anti-conceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Heparin low molecular weight is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published patents on their use.
On April 14th, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the re-adaptation of antiviral drugs developed for prior outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese patents
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese patents
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible adjustments to COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (block IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
{NS}
with A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop that vaccine.
Towards the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in security studies in phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important bridge was extended by the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As set out in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the days of the main platforms that took place in security studies in phase I are the following:
Nuclear acid (ADN and ARN) (developerator of phase I and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector ( Phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
Scientists from CEPI reported in April, in total, 115 possible vaccines are at the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milk Institute) and 37 of which are announced, but with little information available (it is estimated to be planning or developing).
A phase I or II test shall carry out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and carried out on several sites, with more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials often involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still not being evaluated in humans (continued in the preclinical investigation).
About January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular subjection that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
About January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and hopes that human testing will begin in 2021.
Projects for the development of vaccines were announced at the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is codifying an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document designed for a vaccine with similar technology that is used in treatment with neoangic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that they were beginning the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a grantor of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "in 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at the Strong Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced that they were working in a vacuum.
About 10 March 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novamax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 islands and that, despite rapid progress, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, Quebec, reported on the development of a component similar to Coronavirus with partial funding from Canadian Health Research Institutes.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory investigation stage and evidence in humans is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", before the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an ARNm-based vaccine.
The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests in the potential final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in the Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a vaccine research alliance against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading to the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Innovation, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing in six possible vaccines.
Researchers from the London Imperial College announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an ARN vaccine with autoreplication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese sequence.
By the end of March, the Government of Canada announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical research projects to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the medical initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh University Medical College announced the trials of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in rats and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines administered by MNA received powerful responses from the specific antibodies (in rats) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy Faculty announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal duster.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designated to replication within human bacteria and produce innocent particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, together with computer resources in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud cloud.
Some vaccines have specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic rat described by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrate the need to account for level 3 biosafety conservation measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world.
When SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful tool for developing vaccines and anti-emergency treatment by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a vaccine against SROM (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in the social media promoted a conspiracy theory whereby COVID-19 caused the virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents mentioned by various publications in social media refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as SRAG's coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome acute 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of olphate and abdominal pain.
The time that passes between exposure and the start of symptoms is often five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress in viral pneumonia and multi-orgian insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been recovered. The virus is spread mainly among people during close contact, usually through coughs that are produced in tossing, drying or talking.
Although these gouts are produced by exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or surfaces, instead of being contaminated in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the start of symptoms, although promotion is also possible before symptoms and in late stages of the disease occur. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the polymerase chain with inverse inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hesopathic.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory pathways, such as rashes, nasal cough, and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially brought pressure on the neck and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease has progressed to pneumonia, multi-orgian insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5 per cent of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all patients have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of people not infected with symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Centres for Control and Prevention of Korean Diseases (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases continued asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78 per cent) were asymptomatic when the trial was carried out.
Both spout and salva can have large viral loads.
Speaking in a loud voice is more free than talking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth of the torser can make the rubbers travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not often air-transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the passage outside the people's bedrooms gave positive results in viral ARN.
Some medical procedures, such as intubate and cardiopulmonary re-imamination (RCP) may cause respiratory secretion and air transmission.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spread by hens, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propaganda is possible before the symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not quite clear how easily it spreads, a person is generally infected with two or three more diseases.
In particular, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this would vary according to humidity and temperature.
The jabone and the detector are also effective if they are used properly. The apple products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, salva samples were taken in an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of test.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related natural coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the domestic frog kills the virus because it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by the COVID-19, due to the virus entering the host cells through angiotensin I-type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which is more common in lung-type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplica" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, a severe heart attack was identified, which is more common in the severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the disease development, but acute myocardial injury may be associated with ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in their heart and participate in their operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been detected in patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to a prognostic disorder. In the autopsies of people who failed COVID-19, diffusion alveolar (DAD) and lymphocytes were detected in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic of epithelial cells that express ECA2 in respiratory pathways, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, it was observed that the secretive T lymphocytes of GM-CSF pathogens are correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretive monocytes and a serious pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytes were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is often performed in samples of respiratory pathways obtained through a nasopharyngeal hysopharyngeal; however, samples of nasal or spoutal hysophabad may also be used.
In general, results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples must be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus layer and published the genetic sequence so that world laboratories could develop independent polymerase chain response (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, anti-body tests (which may detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the evidence has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first diagnostic test immediately on 21 March 2020 to use it at the end of that month. The diagnostic methods published by the zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University would suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
The oscillators with peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution are common in the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domains may appear, unsorted roof pattern (septular septal enlargement with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
A few data on microscopic injuries and COVID-19 physiopathology are available.
The main pathological results of autopsies are:
Macroscopia: pluritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, nematodes hyperplasia, atypically large neurocytitis, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and the formation of giant cells with multiple nucles
severe neumonymia: diffusive alveolar (DAD) damage with exudated diphus alveolar.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
treatment neumonymonia: organisation of exodus in alveolar cavides and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: divided intravascular coagulation (CID); leucoythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap often by, at least, 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a pan towel or towing and, if not to have pans, use the inner part of the code.
An appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after touching or drying.
The CDC has recommended the use of teaspoons in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce contact with people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling public meetings.
The distance rates also indicate that people must keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As it is not expected that there is a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to control COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also often recommend washing hands with water and jab for, at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are apparently dirty, before eating and after sunning the nose, towels or towels.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant that has a minimum of 60 % alcohol, but only when no water and soap are available on occasion. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two forms for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for the antiseptic of hands".
Glycerol is added as a inducer.
Patients are given support attention, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extrabodyal membrane oxidation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy nutrition have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people treated with COVID-19.
Intensifiers and neurologists in the United States have compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamine) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care environments when procedures can be conducted that can generate aerosols, such as intubate or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation area (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlights the patterns for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is a battle of EPP, mascarillas, anti-protectives and medical gloves. When available, breathers (instead of masks) are preferred.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised their use by an emergency authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but they are not guaranteed efficacy against a specific biological agent which is not specified in the product indications.
When no masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of protective helmets or, as a last resort, married masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people who are hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow or positive biliary channel in respiratory pathways.
It is still not known whether any of these two provide the same benefit to people in critical status.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal channel. Serious cases occur mainly in adults (mainly over 60 years and in particular over 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough headbeds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation and 1.4% fell.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 presents acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
In order to maximize the supply of oxygen, respiratory infections associated with respiratory and neomotorax are needed.
The oldest breathers may not count with high PPTE.
The study on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines can last until 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers take part in trials on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to convalient plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is identified, the application not only recommends autoconference, but also alerts local health officials. Analysis of cell information macrodata, facial recognition technology, monitoring of mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and those who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track the data on mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data from the location of telephones with the German federal agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect non-compliance with the quarantine.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulia Gallera said that mobile phone operators have informed him that "in all ways, 40% of the people continue to move".
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackation with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about the quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect torture for the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease can follow a mild evolution with little or no symptoms, so it will seem to other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as common cold.
Light cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while heavy or critical cases can last from three to six weeks to do so.
pregnant women may be at risk of serious infections due to COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SRAG and SROM virus, but COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most serious cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organal failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, alteration of coagulation and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The change in coagulation, in particular increase in protombin time, has been observed in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19; whereas renal function change is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have high hepatic enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average period of seven days was spent between hospitalization and death.
In an initial case study, the average time from the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the rate of mortality among rats was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of postmortem lung samples show widespread alveolar damage with exudated cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Citopatic changes were observed in the neo-numocytes.
The lung image was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or heart disease.
According to the United States March data, 89 per cent of the hospitalized people had a pre-existing attitude, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by affection would vary from regional to regional, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient account of mild cases can lead to the overestimated mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases committed in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1.4 times more likely to suffer serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or fail compared with non-smokings. They worry about the long-term generations of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease of 20 to 30 per cent in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether prior infections had generated an effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently gave positive effects on coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be an increase in a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and animal origin by means of an interesting infection.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, indicated as the first date of the beginning of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications reported that the first demonstration of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and in time, in addition to being affected by the volume of evidence, quality of the health system, treatment options, time passed from the initial outbreak to the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of a SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall literacy rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240,191) until 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the literacy rate in patients diagnosed (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die of a disease, and the literacy rate in persons infected, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die of a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and continue to a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these may provide information on how many people have been infected.
At the centre of the bridge in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) were already missing.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the Carnival Festivals and affected the younger, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004 per cent of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the rate of mortality are different for males and females.
Mortality is higher between the variables in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk of thieves is for those in their 50s, and the gap between thieves and women is only about 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors may be due.
The immunological differences based on sex, the smallest number of women who smoke and the fact that the rats have congenital infections, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in the rats.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were blind and 72% were disabled by COVID-19 were blind.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government did not track information on sex in COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect the environment and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and have more exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to the crown, VI to viruses, D to disease, and 19 to the date on which the blast was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with the international recommendations, to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease such as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and the disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication that no locations are used in the name of the virus and the disease.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials, such as natural hypotheses and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a breather and the supplier could not deliver it at the time required, a local emergency company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, false information and disinformation arose about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, cats or pigs.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducting international studies on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARD trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ECA2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on protein S that helps to measure the virus in the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (ADN or ARN vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical examination of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that anti-body improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials were evaluated treatment approved for paludism, including four studies on hydrochloroquine or chlorquin.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on redeciding in several countries and should report to the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was being carried out. Several antiviral drugs were evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydrochloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Clinical trials are being conducted in phase III in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquina, previously used to treat paludism, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chlorquin.
However, although Wuhan’s Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of grams, it notes that the double dose is very dangerous and may be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydrochloroquine and chloroquinine to discrepancies of patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese patents also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It has been recommended that more in-living studies of nitazoxanid be performed, following the determination that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial protein S sieve performed by type 2 TMPRSS2 is essential for SARS-CoV-2 input through interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Studies of chlorquin and hydrochloroquine with or without azitromicin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of the COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydrochloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The Chinese National Health Commission included tocilizumab in the treatment regimens after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non- Randomized national trial in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood analysis of serum ferritin ferritin to identify cytokine releases, you are against these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some people infected.
The FDA approved antagonist of the receptor of interleukin-6 based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome against steroids caused by another cause, the treatment of T- CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
Up to date, there is no reasoned evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have been recovered from COVID-19 is being investigated to persons who need them as a passive method of immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was approved by the SRAG with non-concluding results.
Viral neutralization is the mechanism of action expected by which passive anti-body treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or fagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies, for example, are being developed using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalient suction, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients recovered and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
