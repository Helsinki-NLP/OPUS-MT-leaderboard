Croatia's nuclear-processing plan.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the city of northern Bosnia and neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina protested the plan of Croatia to remove some of the wastes from the only nuclear power source in that area near the river, which is known to be near the border with Bosnia.
The Democrats gathered in the city of Novi Glad in Bosnia swore to Croatia that it would fight against the plan in order to defeat the trails of Toulgofska Gora's army.
The facility is to clean up the wastes from the solar power plant of Culsico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future" "We need a stopover of Uunna (the river)," said that the nuclear waste treatment facilities are likely to threaten the lives of 250,000 people living around the river and around it.
We have to resist.
Novie Glad's long-term self-government, Miroslav Drika, told the crowd.
We must fight for the protection of our homes and our rivers.
"The Crusco nuclear power plant, which began driving in the 980s, is located in Slovenia and is owned with Croatia.
Government participants in both countries are planning to open a future agreement and talk about the increase in the disposal of waste treatment facilities.
The delegation of Croatia reported that on Friday, Croatia should build a facility alone, and that Slovenia should not yet decide to pay for any of the waste parts of Croatia's new buildings.
Mr. Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environmental Protection of Croatia, said that Croatia is also in trouble with the treatment of public wastes from prison.
In Bosnia, activists and officials from all nations in the country and residents of Croatia have claimed to seek another site near the nuclear power plant.
"Why, throughout Croatia, would the box of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which means that the Gora is going to be the best place?"

There are not many small retail shops that think of introducing cash decisions before tax increases.

What about the anti-munehausen syndrome syndromes that occurred in the U.S. Police in the Netflix?
It's a lie that a guardian and parents are healthy children.
The police are being sent to Netflix today.
The drama is a story of the President of the United States of America, but it's the first stage of becoming the president of its high school.
It's made by the American Holler Story and Gray's producer Ryan Murphy, and it's Guinness Partero, Ben Platt, and Lucy Bointon.
It's not like it's possible for viewers who can't see the drama, but it's not like that, but it's not even possible for viewers to see the drama, but it's like the drama is like the anti-mune hause syndrome -- it's a mental disorder that protects people who are not really sick, even if they're not really sick, physically and mentally ill.
There are different types of diseases, but they are also the disease itself, and they include muchyhausen syndrome.
But it's a lie that the anti-munehausen syndrome group is clearly the disease of others under its protection.
This is known as FII, fake or sexually transmitted diseases, and it's a form of child abuse.
There are special symptoms, but usually the parent spreads the symptoms, causes the symptoms, and may make the child sick.
So what's the sign of the anti-munehausen syndrome?
The patient's symptoms change in case bickering, but NHS is paying attention to the following things.
The kids are healthy, and they're trying to talk to the doctors.
Explains the magnitude or false symptoms.
In order to make children feel sick, they can be shown that lead sugar is mixed in the test.
It causes symptoms of disease, such as drug or other drugs, which are passed on to the stomach.
How common are the anti-munehausen syndromes?
Because many cases are not reported, it's hard to know how wide these diseases are.
A study published in 2000 suggested that 89 out of 100,000 people had an outbreak in two years.

Nigeria: Police force school in Kaduna, 300 children rescued.
The Qadjuna-Cadjuna police conducted a forced investigation at Igabi's Lein Maidovon Tungma, which took seven teachers and saved about 300 children.
The police say children were placed in an unhumanitarian environment, but the school side denied this claim.
"The children are entering school because they have all their parents' promises, and their claims are not true."
"Before the children entered school, the parents signed a contract.
They've been sending food to children every day, and they know what kind of environment they're in.
I was surprised that the police had shut down the school after they had taken all the food that their parents had sent to them, and that they had left their children behind.
It's unfair to say that there are parents who can prove that they've left their children in a terrible environment like the police say. "
He adds that he once visited the former chief of police, Abdularman, to see what the children were in the environment, but he did not say anything about it.
And the kids were just learning the Koran, that's all, they're saying.
However, the chief of the police station, Jacob Sabo, says that children will be reunited with their parents when they are transferred to the state government.
"In a name that says to get knowledge about the Koran, they were placed in an unhumanitarian environment.
Many children have been hit by injuries.
So I'm looking into school to find out about the owner of the facility."

Three times, we're going to get rid of the sexes of high-ranking books, and we're looking at the sexes, and we're talking about the North Sea news.
It was 28 days that the three-fold educational committee decided to remove the gender gap of high school admission.
"In an eight-year-old student's interview, the prosecutor admitted that he did not register the sex column from the electoral formula, but that he would lose his identity for 20 years.
As for class divisions and sports groups, they use the research that they create in high school.
Only in the research book, you can register with the student in terms of freedom, and you can describe the sex series that was selected.
According to the Committee, the sexual division of the public elite is not a "9-year-old" but a 20-year-old removal of the North Sea and the Nile River.

The girl rapist of the Central Cost's "excessively Infamous" suit, ordered by the court against the victim.
In May 2017, a man who wore a colorful glycism that had ended up in high school in central Costa, U.S.A., brought a 12-year-old girl back to school.
Then the man added a sexual assault on the girl.
After the arrest, a search warrant was issued, and the police arrested most of the items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man admitted guilt against seven suspects, including three suspects of violence and other 11-year-old girls.
When 12-year-olds were walking along the streets, they saw a man armed with a large wooden stick and a knife coming out of a hurry.
When the girl asked, "Stop, stop, stop."
The man says to the girl, "Don't make a loud noise.
I'm going to have to make it painful when I'm out of my mind."
The man had his right hand with a knife and hit the girl's legs with a cable-tie, and then he hit the tree for about an hour.
He cried like he was crazy. He went to school.
The man had several telephone and phone calls from his colleagues, but he didn't answer, and he came to work at 9:00 a.m.
The man stood out wearing clothes like wheat, barley, and wood, and ran to the road, running to the driver's door, and said he was in the mud.
A man's trial will continue on the day of the fire.
Pope Roman, AI development is based on public interest and warns IT business representatives.
The Roman Emperor Francisco warned IT business representatives, diplomats and investors that, if they did not share the moral value of public interest, there was a fear of increasing social inequality in the development of human science and other digital development.
The pope spoke at a meeting of government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as at a Vatican meeting held by philosophers, physicists and moralists.
A few students and Catholic teachers were invited to this meeting, entitled "public interest in digital times."
This three-day meeting has proved to be the latest evidence that the Vatican is also willing to participate in the future and dangerous debate on human science development.
A discussion on the future of the development of wartime technology and the future of increased machinework was held at the same time as evidence of the bombings in New Zealand Cristach and the reaction of social media companies to their violent film.
In his own speech at the conference, the pope pointed out that in opening up the industrial revolution, some machines released workers from danger and simple work, and called for the development of technology.
But if we rely too much on robotics to pursue interests, we have a fear of losing the dignity of our work.
"If the progress of technology is the cause of the growing inequality, it is not true progress," the priest warned.
If the so-called technological progress of humans is against the public interest and the enemy, it's going to turn into a state of disillusionment based on the theory of power.
According to the President of the Conference, it is the desire to use the expertise of the participants and to see what the Catholic Church will look like in the future.

Anna Hazarre is surprised to hear of a case in which the Bank of Maharashtra's association has been involved in the insolvency of Sharad Pearl.
Anna Hazarre said, "When this complaint came into contact, the name of Sharad Pearl was not on the list."
Ms. Anna Hazaré, a social activist, was surprised that the name of the National Parliamentary Party (NCP) Sharad Pearl was suddenly raised in the case of the thousands of rupees involved in the joint bank fraud in Maharashtra.
In connection with the fraud incident, the Bureau of the Research Agency (ED) filed a complaint against the Deputy Prime Minister of the State of Azit Pearls in Maharashtra.
Based on the law on the prevention of money laundering, the report of the executive agency that was opposed to the first report of the police was recorded by the central authorities.
This complaint is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, which was reported by the Bank's president, Azit Pearl and 70 members of the Joint Bank.
When this complaint came into contact, the name of Sharad Pearl was nowhere.
The executive asked about the suspicion that Sharad Pawar was involved in the fraud, and Anna Hazaré said, "How did the name of Sharad rise, and who said it?"
Anna Hazaré, who criticised Sharad Pearl, expressed the hope that the executive would prove the truth if he carried out a detailed investigation on the fraud.
Anna Hazaré, who is most of the concrete that prevents work, said, "The executive will know how his name is raised in this case."
Sharad Pearl denied all the wrongs and claimed that there was no real relationship with the bank, and questioned the timing of the protest recorded a few weeks before the election of the Parliament of the state of Maharashtra on 21 October.
The Prime Minister of the United Nations clearly pointed to the Indian People's Party's leadership and said he must not bow to the "kingdom" of Deli.

Milan, agreed to pay $3 million to settle the epipen problem.
Milan agreed to pay $3 million in peace because he had not disclosed to investors information about the lack of demand for epiphany for the media.
Banks, U.S.A., reported that Milan's company classified the epiphany as a "Generic" for a drug-free program in the media.
This showed that payments to the government of the pharmaceutical company were lower than the limit when Epipen was classified as a brand.

The company's statement on Friday does not confirm or deny the claim of the SEC.

I'm going to buy you some security in the accident and in the Riznabul.
A traffic accident caused by a traffic accident.
Otherwise, there's an increase in the number of accidents caused by a high driver's block and axel's failure.
And when we're getting really fast, we're going to be panicky, and we're going to have to get the blackheads down, and then we're going to have to get out of here.
A new vehicle equipped with security support features such as to cover such a transport failure is present, but there are also possible rear-view devices for unloading.
It's an off-the-spot marker that's been developed, and it's being sold as an emergency protection system.

When the system stops or slows down, the "warming sound" occurs when you're going to break up and break down and you're going to need an axelpedal.
It's a way to get back to the voice and to get back to the voice and quickly recognize the error of the crash.
Because of the failure of the axel, the engine changes become clear, even effective for the high-level driver who is willing to listen.
The suit was moved to the OBDII connector, and the body was placed on both sides.
It's the price, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value, the value.
The World Wardwing started the launch in mid-September, but the Axel Bracky's misbehavior's defense device will be preserved.
It's not just the time to go back.
When an axelpedal is rushed to the front and back of the vehicle (and 10km/h) and when an axelpedal is rapidly plugged in, it detects the speed of both the vehicle and the brake signal, and it inhibits the acceleration of the axel.
When an axelpedal has gone wrong, do not send a signal from the axel, and at the same time control the movement of the crip (the state of the block away in the Drenzi).
In the back of the back, you'll be able to check the speeds of more than 5 km/h, and you'll be able to force the vehicles to switch to a clip state.
It's only possible to deal with a capraone and a simple comparison process.

Birds, risk-circuits, farmers in Nepal, three times the U.S. newspaper.
[On the right-hand side of the Dawa Farms Park in Nepal, which monitors the risk facilities]
[Pierns] 10 ministers of the Daw Dulche Rama Farms of Nepal visited three-fold bird cities and the city capital park on 26 days and visited as a collection of biofuels.
In his country, he followed and treated most of the waste of his life, but by leaving the student behind, Mr. Bean, a professor at the Japanese University of Agricultural Economy in Zingin, (67), was introduced to the development of organic farming in non-alcoholic countries, and he started a project to lead the city to the city of Katmans State of Timi.
Since technology is being used in the co-operation facilities of 19-year-old birds in the cave, the visit will begin in February 30th and will be a three-fold visit to the audience this time.
Prime Minister Dava, who was first involved in the survey, spoke to a local mayor in the city office, who said, "The Japanese technology is growing in the world, not just Timmy, but the country," and asked for the exchange of the city's contents in the vision.
The mayor of the city said, "I'm surprised that I'm not going to go to all the birds' towns yet.
It's been a long time since we were born with a mother's experience, and it's been a long time since we've been talking about our family, and it's been a long time since we've been in the middle of the world, and it's been a long time since we've been in the middle of a new world.
"What's going on with the white town's children?" (Deputy representative) opened a 27-day meeting in a famous city hall in Zhao-Hunga.
Some 20 mothers in their childhood thought about the danger of each family, and they realized what they wanted to do with their own bodies.
Mr. Benshauri, North of the city, (32) said the three-year-olds who loved the garden of shelter could not go to the shelter immediately after the flood and be made at night.
"Because the adults were busy at home, and there was not enough time to get together," he said, "the adults didn't want to get tired, and they wanted to make sure they could say 'all right'."
The capital of the city was founded by Mr. Chaniri (36), who spent one night in the city of refuge for four families, including three children.
"If there's a child who doesn't have to go on, I'll take care of the environment."
From the age of four, women (45) from the centre of the city centre of Zhuang, from two years old to two years old, were immersed in water around the house.
"You can't run away with five people," he said, trying to spend the rest of his life in his own home as long as he can.
"It's not right to be prepared. The necessary preparations will change in the family structure and living conditions."
A six-and-a-eight-year-old in the White House (or 40) suggested, "The primary school had an e-mail in the past day, but there's no connection network or mail system, and a e-mail message system."
I also wanted to build a system that could share the water supply in realtime.
Mr. Rainbow said, "Before the weather changed, the weather wasn't going to be okay.
The representative in the country said, "I think I'm going to talk to the administration as a group."
Boris Johnson and a female businessman, Jennifer Archley, have a visit to the police station.
The IOPC will examine whether President London's absence of criminal law should be examined by Prime Minister Johnson.
In a statement by the London Administrative Board (GLA), Mr. Arkuli said that Mr. Arkuri had been approached by a friendly relationship with the Prime Minister and that the GLA's supervisor had recorded the "acts of action" of the Prime Minister.
"What's about action," says the GLA, is if there's information that shows that crime is likely to be committed."
It's not that this has never been proven.
IOPC will examine whether this is necessary.
This issue was addressed to IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that responds to the allegations made by the British and Wells police.
The problem was that Mr. Johnson at the time was involved in the work of the police officer.
Mr. Johnson denied the wrongs associated with Mr. Arkuli's relationship with him.
First of all, Mr. Johnson said he would like to follow the London Parliament's order to ask for detailed information about Mr. Archley's relationship.
While this statement was reported by Sandtimes, it was reported that seven years ago, Johnson paid 126,000 pounds of gold in the capital city of London to his American brother Archuri, who had moved to London, and received three times as much respect as he would have been able to share with Johnson in foreign-related missions.
Since then, the government has spent 100,000 pounds of aid to Hackerhouse, an Arkuli company in the investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process before the aid is paid.
Mr. Matt Wwarman of the Department of Digital Affairs said in the basement, the Digital province went "normally correct" and its company owned the English phone number.
However, according to many reports, the number number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arkuli (34) is now placed.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female workers was "the public secret between the employees."
The GLA's move to pay the Prime Minister to the police station was angered by the Prime Minister.
The government officials say it's a "political attack" and the timing of the party's meeting last night was "too much."
"In any case, the supervisory body did not provide evidence, prior to a press release late Friday night, and the Prime Minister was not given an opportunity to respond to the supervisory body."
Nationals and Moscow will see a little of the political crazy language that has been developed ever since.
First of all, the standard newspaper heard that the relationship between London's observation and regional motivation, which was supported by Johnson and California's staff, was "secretly secret" among employees.
The president of the London Party (L&P) said that Mr. Arkuli's company at the time was considered to be "hard to believe", and that he wanted to have the privilege of accompanying him in a business interview outside Johnson's time.
It's a security fund used by the generals to create property!
This is the 20th anniversary (Moningster) - Yahoo! News
I've just heard from the president of the post office's chief of staff, who is looking forward to this.
- I've got 20 years since I set up this year.
What's going on in 20 years and feeling right now?
First of all, in 20 years of history, there was a lot of thought and effort.
I want to express my deep appreciation for all aspects of this.
Still, I thought, "I'm supporting the development of the general population."
This spirit hasn't changed. It's been in vain for 20 years.
And I'm going to say that if the general ways of dealing with money's insecurity are solved, the world will come out of the soil, and I'm going to encourage you to work as a whole day.
In the long term, it doesn't make sense that the operation must be done with the beneficiaries and the passengers.
There's a lot of money in the "known fund" when you're hit by a disaster like Rimanshock and Itbabel.
"That's why we're here to support the businesses that are needed in the world," I feel that we've been understanding the message we've been asking for from day to day.
That's why it's been a 20-year long fund, and that's why the message continues to be sent in many ways.
In the last month's report, all investment companies, money and costs have been open.
It's just that we're going to tell you what we're buying now, and we're going to have a black box, but then we're going to show you what we're buying.
This is the only reason we've been confident about this.
Mark Miller's death, the three-person drug arresters are key.
Lasanzels (AP communication) - a drug crime involving Mr. Mac Miller of Rapper last year, involving drug abuse and death from drug abuse, and three of his men were arrested.
According to the Court's record, Stephen Walter was suspected that Mr. Miller had been mistaken in September of cocaine, alcohol, and fentanyl before he died, and that fentanyl had sold the fake oxycodon that he had mixed, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that is as large as thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter's being accused of selling drugs to Mr. Miller to another person, Cameron Petitt.
According to the trial report published on Friday, Petitt was taking drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Lewis, who was arrested earlier this week in Reykhabashti, Arizona, was questioned about the crime he was sending to Petitt as a "partner" in Walter.
Three people are not directly questioned about the deaths of Mrs. Miller, and they are still protesting about each other.
Walter, who is now in detention, is sentenced to five months in prison because he was in custody for a drug incident in 2005.
Inspectors of this item first reported by the Serbian website TMZ on Thursday are asking that Walter be kept until the trial began because of the very high possibility of fleeing abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call from the lawyer.
Petit was charged at the Federal Court of Justice on 4 September, but the lawyer refused to comment.
In Miller's song, there are direct words about drugs and drugs, and there's a fan in the hip hops.
Miller from Pittsburgh, Malcolm James Mayers McMick, had been in contact with the singer's Alana Grande for two years, but he was destroyed early in 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande wrote his favorite Miller movie on his own inttaggram and published a song about the love of Miller, called "Sanku Next".
Miller is also one of the musicians who died from opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Lockband3 down's guitarist masseuse Roberts has also died because of drug abuse in 2016, and fentanyl and hydrocodone have been found in the body.
In this article, Stephen, not before Walter's name, was corrected by Stephen.
Nigeria's 9-year-old daughter, developed over 30 mobile games.
This nine-year-old girl is making a lot of games using the Scratch2 program.
Using Scratch2, you can make games, animations, and stories in online mode.
And so far, you've used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide rooms.
The player gets the point that he'll catch the komory out of the hiding place.
I learned how to build a game in a short time centre.
Bazill said to CNN, "You're wasting your time playing games when you're not depressed."
In March, Father applied for a five-to-five-year-old child to attend a short-term conference.
This speech from the CodeFest Internet Manager was introduced to give children such as Bazilu to access new technologies such as robotics and fantasy.
According to his father's father, Basil Okpara Sinai, the basil baby grew up in most mobile games.
"Bazill was always on the phone and playing games, and he bought a tablet when he was four.
Candy Krash and Temple Ran did it."
But I was surprised that the game was just a bit of fun, so at the age of seven, I was interested in the construction of the game.
"One day, I was making a tablet like that, but I was really dreaming of the game, and I was a little tired," he said.
I was standing up and I said, ‘They're always playing games, but how about you make the game yourself like everyone else?’
When I said that I was angry, I didn't think Bagilla was really interested."
Since then, a little basil who was interested in learning how to build his game, asked his parents to buy a laptop, and enrolled in the first stage of the game production.
Bazill, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has a name for the rest of his game.
One of the games, "Mosscat Mass" can be bought in GooglePlasta.

The president of the North Carolina Communist Party, who was found guilty of fraud in the investigation.
According to the document submitted to the Court of Justice, the President of the United Nations High Commissioner for Social Affairs of North Carolina admitted that he had proved false to the federal agents who had conducted an investigation of the main political donors.
In one of the cases of the Federal Court of Justice, Robin Hayes is responsible for the crime on Sunday.
According to a document on the fact that Heis's lawyer had signed, Heiss was aware that he was making false accusations against FBI agents during the 2018 investigation.
The actual judicial contract documents have not been recorded and are not identified as a crime that Heise is actually about to admit.
Hayes was told at the time about the crime of fraud, fraud, and false accusations.
The investigation party said that the President of the Security Council was involved in the plan for the re-examination of special treatment, which he wanted to submit to the president of the state's insurance company's president.
Two of the co-founders, Greg Lindberg, were told without hesitation to the chief security officer of the state of Mike Cozey.
Lindberg has been the founder of insurance and investment companies and has been contributing over $5 million to state and federal electoral candidates and committees since 2016, and has been the top political donor of the state in recent years.
Lindberg supported the Common Party's ideas and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
I didn't answer the question of a lawyer at Lindberg, who asked for a comment on the e-mail.
On Friday, I didn't answer the request for additional comments on the e-mail to a lawyer's lawyer, Carns Davis.
The court document submitted to the Bank reported that Heiss lied to FBI agent in August 2018, but this time he said he had not talked to Kodzi about staff at the State Security Agency.
However, according to a document based on the fact, Hayes was actually talking about the anti-inhibitive dependence on State Security Officers and Lindberg.
The investigators helped Lindberg rely on Kodzi and Metting, and also said he talked to the supervisor directly about the crash.
The complaint published in April claimed that Lindberg had sought special treatment for his own insurance business and had planned to complete a maximum of $2 million for Kozi's re-election in 2020.
According to the prosecution, this conspiracy involved the replacement of the authorities who were investigating Lindberg's company.
Kodzi, a member of the Communist Party, informed the federal agent of his undisputed suspicions and helped the stand.
There's no doubt in Kodzi.
In the case of the prosecution, including Lindberg and Kodzi, it is reported that the joint economic operator of Lindberg had instructed Heise to send $250,000 to the Kodzi re-election activity.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was initially protesting that he would pay such a high price to pay attention, but that he had failed in the meeting.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "Whatever you want."
"All right, I'll do it."
In response, the Federal Bureau of Investigations requested detailed information on the trial on e-mail.
Facebook, look at the happiness of the user, all right!
In the first world experience that brings the happiness of the user, some of the users will not be able to see the number of people who have seen the release and video.
In July, after a similar test was started in Australia, the same instaggram was started. Well, it's not possible to be a personal user or a printer.
The new trial of this Facebook book is starting with a coin, and it's still going to start in Australia.
The political leader of Facebook Australia, Mia Garrick, said that this change is based on the Fideback of Mental Health experts who consider the number to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garyk said, "There's been a very positive feedback from a lot of action groups and mentors."
The user, well, not the number of reactions, is just to delete the numbers so we can focus on the quality of the exchange and the content.
Rather than feeling competitive, Gary said that he would be more secure and expect to be able to share in this platform.
Garrick also claimed that businessmen holding Facebook are receiving the same metrics as they have accessed to so far.
It is time for Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, and Ireland to carry out the same test in the same country.
The Facebook plugin plugin does not announce whether this test will be finished or will still be modified.
"There was also the first positive feedback on the tests at the Istaggram, but now there is a lesson to be learned," said Garyk.
Garrick, in Australia, of the world's research country, pointed out that Australia has a user of Facebook and Instagram who has been highly effective in "technology" in Australia.
His colleague, Australia, thought it was a great country to get a really good feedback about whether it was a valuable experience for people or not.

One day my mother's favorite bag of gold was taken away, and she didn't go anywhere.
If you've lost your favorite bag of gold, you're gonna want to continue to love it.
I was helping me at that time, but it was a hand-held party in Candace.
"Maybe you didn't sell it again."
My mother's broken bag, it's a real pipplatz.
So when we asked for repairs to the store, it became a situation where the price of the body went up a lot.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to.
I first went to the home center, and I was looking for something to replace this connection.
It's just, even if there's a ring ring, it's all silbar.
I didn't really see Gold.
I saw him go to Canada in a Dame. I finally found him!
I was impressed when I found it in the hand-cooner.
I'm going to be 100, but I'm going to be 100.
It's like a party used for keyholders and chrome DIY.
So we're going to have to do it on both sides of the Bughandle, and we're going to have two purchases.

So we've got a way to fix the Bug.
Let's do it right now.

SNS Star of Pakistan, Mr. Candile Baroque's famous killer.
Canadian Baroque, who was named after a photo of the Social Media, was murdered in July 2016.
In Pakistan, social media activists, Canadian Baroque's brother was convinced that he was guilty of murder on Friday, the day of the murder of his sister, and that he was sentenced to the most prestigious murder in Pakistan in the country of his father's country.
The average self-sustainment picture is not the size of the U.S. standard, but it was triggered by a very strong Pakistani look at women, and a famous Baroque was murdered in July 2016.
My brother Muhammad Washim was arrested.
A few days later, the brother said, "Of course he killed my sister, and she didn't forgive me for what she did.
Mr. Salder Memoud, his colleague lawyer, told the AFP that the court in the eastern city of Multan had sent a death sentence to Washington's accused in the pending trial.
"Inshalar will be innocent in the Supreme Court," said the lawyer.
First of all, Mrs. Baroque's mother, Anwar May, told the AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin on the son.
My daughter and my son."
Mr. Barothe's murder is a global news, and as he saw the fate of the community of fathers, the victim is again fueled by a voice calling for action against the extension of the so-called ‘smooth killer’.
Women have been burned, shot, killed or killed in a crime that, in the case of her husband, Mr. Ebaroch, called her sect and humiliated her family.
The murder is carried out by close parents who want to kill.
Then, by means of Pakistan's death penalty and the law of Diaa, the offender can ask for forgiveness from the victim's relatives.
Three months after Mr. Barothe's murder, the Parliament passed a new bill binding the death penalty on the famous killer.
However, the deaths are committed to the judgment of the judge, and the murderer may claim another motive on the theory and may be forgiven.
In the case of Mr. Barothe, the parents of the first couple claimed that they would not forgive their son.
But the parents who were upset about losing their son said that they wanted to change their mind and forgive their son.
In the face of international hatred for murder, the Pakistani Government has been an unprecedented means of declaring that both parents and the country are behind them, but the complaint has continued.
In the famous behavior of Mr. Baroque, there is a request for a strip show to the Pakistani cricket team and a very red dress that was wide open to Barentinde.
Although criticism and threats were felt, many people, including young people, were recognized by many people in a country that is considered to be a political activity that is leading up to the status of women with great courage.

He fled to one of the shelters, which was set up in the city of Zhao.
Most refugees did not produce large shelters, and most of them did not move to two complete shelters, and many of them were heard to complain of hunger outside the house.

But if it's where the university professor is standing, it might be a little bit hard for an old pattern that says, "There's even more danger of being a university teacher."
I'm not here for that, so I'm happy every day.
I'm gonna live when I say, "I should do this" or "I should do this."
So if you don't change, people and society will change.
I've been talking to my recent book of life and everything that's going on.
It's natural to say "surprising" and "power," and it's natural to recognize that person.
I don't think it's easy for you to be alone.
It's hard for me to ask myself.
I'm sorry, but I'm not talking to you at the Cantonese Film Festival.
We're going to treat ourselves like a beautiful movie monitor.
It's not a real person who has to walk too fast.
I mean, I can't help it if it's called "a little bit."
As far as I've heard of a number of women, it's like no position or age, any man says "good."
It's hard to say, "I'm good."

In the north-west of Nigeria, more than 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
According to the U.S. statement, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria has increased by an increase of some 40,000 over the past four months.
According to the U.S. National Civil Service, this confusion has created a "new humanitarian crisis" that all agencies will need to cooperate to make a new $35.5 million investment effort by the end of this year.
UNHCR’s babar Baroque journalist said that the Islamic anti-government movement, which has been active in northern Nigeria for 10 years, is not related to a number of recent armed attacks.
Instead, during the past 10 months, the violence in the state of Socot, in the state of Nigeria, in Samfera, and in the state of Katina has been organized by armed groups.
"I have a great deal of fear of the state of illegality and insecurity," said the Baroque journalist, who told reporters on Friday.
The journalist said that rape, rape, murder, and sexual violence were rampant, and the attackers destroyed their homes and worked on theft.
The military and police are also being sent to the crime organization in the area.
But the army is tired of fighting with the Islamic West African Ministry of State, Bokoham and the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't want to name the group," said Mr. Baroque.
What they're carrying is a terrible physical experience.
Most of the refugees are moving to Nigel.
UNHCR stated that, particularly in the state of Scotland, the situation has deteriorated, and refugees moving to Nigeria have announced that they will be expected to increase in the next few months.
A new court date for a man who killed two women and children.
The trial date of the Guatemalan man who was killed by a woman in Iowa and her two children was confirmed.
According to the record of the Pocket Court, Marvin Escobal Oleana (31) was charged with the first murder in three cases, named after the former police that the authorities had approved.
He's claiming no guilt.
According to the police, on 16 July at the demon's home, he shot Mr. Rosiebes Flores Rodrigues (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
In the Court's record, it's time to decide the court's date again on 27 May and make time for both prosecutors and prosecutors.
According to the U.S. immigration tax authorities, Escobal Orelana was illegal in the United States and was sent twice before this gun.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal immigration to the United States.
The Internet Media Network (under SMN) launched a lecture on the "Logicad for Publishers" in Prebid.js, which provides "Logicad for Publishers".
The LFP is a service that is compatible with the wishes of the advertising director, who buys a single advertising package and implements it.
This service provides an effective release of DSP "Logicad" through media contacts.
Heder Biding is an initiative to give a high priority to the media in order to engage in fair competition in several bids (proposals) and advertising companies.
As a solution to the higher transparency for media companies, which can be expected to improve profits, it is in the process of leading large-scale media into the centre.
So far, the "Logicad" has provided the SSP on advertising.
In recent years, in order to respond to the demand for "the trust of every business, brandy and parental character" of the advertising industry, the media associations have started the direct sale of advertising that the advertising wants.
This time, in response to head-visiting, the LFP's introduction will be complemented.
As advertising director Merit, thanks to LFP's leadership response, it is possible to participate directly in the advertising campaign and to look forward to the promotion of credit opportunities.
And since the media companies are limited, they are also assured that the advertising on every commercial and brand image is reliable and prevent the damage to brand value.
As a media company to Merit, it is suggested that a solution that can be added to the media's lead hopes is possible by holding the code of the "Webper" companies that the LFP will continue to connect.

The 30-year-old Man-Man-Man-Man-Man-Man-Man in Pawahara.
As there was a pawahara, a threat to students, the mountain range declared that 30-year-old male assistants who served in Michacampas (Michambas) were sentenced to two months' imprisonment.
It's the same date.
According to the Department of Public Services, since October 2017, male assistants have been leading a number of students belonging to the study room and have become sensitive and repeated with harsh words and strong stress.
It's the Pawaharra in the education direction, and it's found that it has damaged the educational environment.
There was a complaint from a number of students in the Anquete, which was executed on September 18.
In addition to the Department of Industry's management spoke to students and teachers, since the same year, Halasment's students have been investigating the Committee on the Prevention of Reaction and finally applied for Halasment from one of the students.
As a result of an investigation by the Commission, the prosecutors and officials of the Council decided to make a ruling.
And after Anquet, the male assistants continued to be educated, but the conversation improved, and the person said, "I didn't apologize."
The school principal said: "I'm going to start with the victim, and I'm going to make an all-in-a-kind statement, and I'm going to take care of him and try to restore confidence."
At the same time, the Ministry of Industry's male teacher has continued to investigate the fact that there are doubts about the conduct of girls leading to sex-hazards and that if they are to be prosecuted, they will be able to publish them.
In order to reduce the EU's demand for the EU's removal, Boris Johnson was asked to join the EU.
The idea that the Prime Minister will not spend much time in the prime minister's office is now only three weeks before the EU summit is held.
Mr. Boris Johnson is facing internal opposition to the EU's request to withdraw from the EU and seek to join the EU.
A new system of tax evasion is being negotiated in Ireland, and the EU considers Mr. Johnson's alternative is "unimplementable".
The top ministers expect the EU's black screens, the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, to propose a three-year time limit on the backstop, to be set in the ground.
After the last annual meeting of the Conservative Party opened in Manchester, Sa Sanja heard a talk with the Prime Minister on three occasions.
They're asking Prime Minister Dominique Kamings to leave the "extremely" strategy and claim that the EU will accept an offer to issue over a limited period of time.
One of them said that the decision to close the summit on Friday was a "warrant" which was illegal, and that, in the present state, the agreement was the only way we can get rid of "3 September".
We shall not give them victory in the lower House, and they are against Us, in opposition.
The Prime Minister must make use of what he can use more than walking.
It doesn't work, but the Kamings plan is obviously wrong.
You can't fight in so many areas.
The other party, however, promised to speak to Mr Johnson to carry out the Prime Minister's agreement.
The Prime Minister added, "If necessary, Boris will be told to return the case of Teriza to the basement."
And that's why the numbers are round, and everyone's trying to get this over with.
If it doesn't delay, Boris is over, and we're all over.
John Major, he accused Boris of not seriously considering the transaction.
We are told that the Prime Minister wants to reach an agreement with the EU.
But we do not see the fact that the Prime Minister is in a position to negotiate with the EU.
Instead, we've seen the Prime Minister fight with the bull in Scotland, investigate the bull in Wales, and debate with the national in large numbers."
The Prime Minister's reporter admitted yesterday that the agreement was still in progress, "If anyone fails to reach a goal that has no difference in mind, it's still longer."
However, when the reporters made an unconstitutional withdrawal, the Ben Bill, which forced a three-month extension, said in Brussels, "the position of our negotiations is very weak."
The journalist said, "This bill is certainly blocking our relations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to continue their efforts, even though they have created it, to make progress."
The United States Secretary-General Steven Barclay will return to Brussels today for an agreement with the EU's Michel Barnie.
Both discuss documents on how the regular regionalization of the entire island of Ireland will work.
I said, "The glass gorge will never succeed in a television world."
Robin Kelly found out that he was told by the TV bosses that he was going to be a "no success" as a director in that glass gorge.
And before we first appeared on TV, she said, "It's very tense."
"I'm still 25 years old, I'm very nervous," she says.
I was working as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and I was told that you're not going to succeed at your high-ranking high school on the street.
I went to London to see all the TV-am teams before I left in the garage office, and to see where the program was being sent.
I'll never forget that morning that Ryan, Diamond, and Mike Morris were interviewing a historical woman, Olivia Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as the living story.
I knew where I wanted to be.
Kelly started working as a local journalist in eastern Scotland, in Kilbrid, "in 984 years she became a journalist at the TV-amscotland office.
Kelly also served the board of directors of the program, such as GMTV and ITV's BlackFasht and Debreck, and then started a project that named her, Lorain.
I've been thinking about 35 years, and I've been sending you a special program that's going to be the last of Kelly's memories, and that's what I'm going to do.
He added, "The zeal and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the secret of survival in the television industry, and he added, "I have to put it into work."
You must be honest and honest.
I'm going to do what I'm supposed to do, get a lot of people interested in it, and get an interest in it.
The news that hit the heart came back, and Kelly found out that it was "very tough" about the Dumblen shooting incident.
"The day that six students and teachers were killed, we didn't think that many of the families of the children who had been killed or injured were seeing us producing a program from Dunbreen.
The mother's mother, Pam, who was killed by five daughter JoAnna, said that Rose wanted to see me personally, so we had to talk to her at her house for hours.
I'm going to Joanna's funeral, and Pam and I've been friends ever since.
Kerry also interviewed his wife when Kate and Gary McCann's wife were missing in 2007, but she said, "It was very tough," and she said, "I really respect her husband's strength and courage."
It's important that a couple have to endure the pressure and the networks that they need to know what's happening to a girl they love.
My wife's not really a bad person.
Lorein's 35th anniversary programme will be delivered to ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September.
Jimbabwe, the Cheunga, who was afraid of the storm.
According to the senior government officer, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the request from President Robert Mugabe, former president of the political revolution, that he might be a spy to pursue military action in November 2017.
While the negotiations between Mugabe and the National Defence Army continued, Mugabe announced that he would join the presidential office in Cheunga, reports the Zimbabwean Indian newspaper last week.
However, the reason that Chiwenga has refused to issue is not because of the uncertainty, but because he saw the intention of using Magabe to inform the leaders of the world's leaders and the African Union that he was deprived of the government's government media.
One of Jamwanda's Twitters, which confirms that the authorities are senior officials of the President's office, says "Mugabé, who has been in power for 37 years, is facing the challenge of joining the government in Cheunga, not Emerson and Munagagwa," and it is reported that a strong deal was being made about this.
Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, planned a contact with the messenger to Chechenga, and the government authorities are speaking.
According to the senior government officer, the military commander's orders and the former president's arbitration were made by three.
President George Charanba of Spokesman, Aaron Nepera and the Roman Catholic priest Fidelis Muconori, who were then representatives of the Central Information Agency, were involved in the negotiations.
Gideon Gono of the Zimbabwean Banking Award is a person who has been charged with the role of the presidential office of the Zimbabwean Defence Force (ZDF) commander from Mugabe alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death, has failed to try to condemn military action in the African Union seeking intervention by the leaders of the African countries.
The presidential election of the former President (Mugabé) was not a request that he be appointed as head of the CDF (Chivenga Commander).
"That's why some of the president's family started to get tired, and it was a self-activating act to save a very high-risk situation."
I just wanted to change the flow, at least diplomatic, so there was a little political jealousy in the president's office.
If it's like destroying the law order, it's going to be confusing and confusing about the African Union's views on the codator, but I want to remind you that the commanders said that they did not break the law order and they didn't want to break it.
So the President (Magabe) was waiting for the commanders who claimed that Chiwenga, who was then a military top, was not breaking the law order.
So the President (Mugab) wanted the African Union to decide whether to place the whole situation as a codator, not to call it a codator, but to consider military intervention requirements to be appropriate.
It was the purpose and the purpose of this proposal.
When they realized that they could not protect themselves from the defense forces, the authorities said.
They were warned that they would be punished like Qadafi in the army, and Mugabe said he couldn't write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that, even though they were entering the capital city called Bloom, they were not going to shoot the citizens.
At that time, Migabe wanted to protect his family and prove the power of the military.
The commanders and the commanders of the day were reading it correctly.
The president's envoy (Gono) used a powerful comparison to say, "Iss Thiry Bemakwap Makwapa (we belong to the Kamofraju Group or the Army) and we are not even in political competitions if we are not politicians."
The army told the other commanders of the area, through the army stationed in Zimbabwe, that the aim was not to break down the mgabe, but to remove the "crimes" from him, and that the government officials are speaking.
In addition, Mugabe tried to call back the same way that Munagawa, who had lived for a short time in South Africa, to talk about the Codetors and the backends.
In addition to the border with the military, Mugabe needed support from the area.
Not only is the economic and territorial strength available to President Jacob Sama at the time was the president of the South African Development Community, but it was clear that the South Africans who were the key to this process refused to intervene, and that if the army entered the capital, they would be sent directly to Harare.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and Africa's leaders, it wasn't really enough," says the paper.
In the United States, the United States has been banned by nuclear deterrence, and the treaty has been ratified by 32 countries.
At the 26th meeting of New York's National Federation, the World of Nuclear Weapons was launched, and the president of the Red Cross Hospital (now the Red Cross) was discussing the Second World War (63), and he expressed support for the Treaty banning nuclear weapons.
On this new day, five countries have ratified the nuclear ban treaty, and 32 countries have become territories.
We need the approval of the 50-country territory for the operation of the treaty.
The meeting and ratification were held in conjunction with the International De détat for the total destruction of nuclear weapons on 26 days determined by the United Nations.
The President of the Gothéres also spoke of a strong sense of repression and non-proliferation in recent years.
I said, "There's no other way to end."
China needs strong leadership, but it's not a policy document.
China needs strong leadership by the Communist Party, and otherwise the country will "break up," and the Government of China said in a policy paper published on Friday in the '70s of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, China's National Bureau News Agency stated that the success of the Communist Party has been guided by the leadership of the party 70 years ago.
China is widespread, and domestic conditions are complex, but the issue of governance is almost impossible.
If there is no strong leadership, China is going to be divided and broken, and the world is going to be a disaster."
China's authorities have long justified, as it is necessary for national security, that they deal with the problem in a strong way, like the democratic movement in Beijing, which took place in 989.
In the summer of 2012, the ruling president of the United States of America, who is the head of the world's Second World Memorial Museum of Economics, has been strengthening the party's power since the fall of 2012, and is strongly opposed to the people who oppose the party.
The usuals have also monitored the latest military programmes that threaten the area.
China does not want to export its development models, does not want to adopt other models, and does not seek peace without a right, says the policy document.
Among the descendants of Chinese people, there is no aggression or world domination of other peoples.
In recent times, China has been subjected to pressure and wars and disturbances have left its suffering deeply affected, and China will never suffer the pain that it has experienced to others.
China is facing a serious civil war in the United States when it is not safe in the country, and it is facing a difficult problem, such as the low-priced and anti-government movement in Hong Kong.
The White Paper says that China will never "reject" its core interests, and will not allow security and sovereignty to be damaged.
"There's no problem with the continuing involvement of the threat of civil war." "With regard to Washington's commercial competition, the White Paper says.
China is a fully-fledged industrial system, full-scale industrial chain, extensive market space and strong economic development.
"Never weaken in the Cold War." The White Paper said.
China is facing difficulties and is convinced that it has the power to turn the crisis into a chance and open a new world.
China has no idea how to fight against the United States, and I don't want to change it for the United States, and America has to slow down China's development.
America can't control China, and it's less likely to stop China's development.
If we control other countries, oppress them, and make domestic conflicts move abroad, America won't be able to maintain power.
[Snifference Balls] A high-level security officer, the leader of the gold department, and the violence of the sports news.
In spring, the name of a five-year-old high-school football club, which was hosted by spring, announced that 28 days had been awarded the same date as the peacekeeper (36) and the Chief of Goldman (42).
The Minister (responsive teacher) is planning a quick decision on the future of the High High Court.
The peacekeeper, the Chief of Gold, reported that on 26 days the map was violent to the baseball team.
When the school members heard about it from two people, the peacekeeper took over the student's head, and the Chief of Gold acknowledged some of the violence.
And the results of a hearing survey of 66 students, and the fact that two more people were actually confirmed, were released on 28 days to admit that they were innocent.
"In five years, the military intelligence officer (74) who was raised in the city of São Paulo (now) was courageous.
The peacekeeper, the Chief of Goldman's system.
"For six to three years, it went out to the summer fields, and it also went out to the spring sembates.
However, when the summer fell to the simulation of the storm, the storm finally broke into the skyscrapers, and the next morning’s sembats were desperate.
Mel C of Spicegarz, who has had an eating disorder in the family, has been banned from talking about diets.
The Meranie Chimham of Spicegars has acknowledged that the family is banning diets from their own eating disorders, which have been not eating anything except fruits and vegetables for years.
The sports pies, under the president of the world pop group, have continued to "exasize to excess" without food for many years, and have subsequently been tested with food disturbances.
Chimham said that his experience is also influenced by the baby of a female scarlett, and he found that everything about diet in the family is forbidden.
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's time for me to focus on my appearance," says Mel.
But because of the food disturbances, I was very interested in talking to the girl when I was talking to her.
A word that goes forward. It's a habit now.
In the 1990s, who became known as a member of Spicegars, who was not a member of the SNS headquarters, and who was involved in the problem of the body's "bad" comments written to Moscow about himself. Mel said in an interview with Women's Health.
"I couldn't look down on myself, pick up certain food groups, and it was as if I had taken it to the size of it, and it was too hard."
I've been in poor health for a few years. "
I'm going to go to the North Sea newspaper, and I'm going to get a divorce.
In a complaint that the "real marriage" for marriage was to be established even during the same period, the District Court of Justice issued a ruling to accept this.
There are more than 20 countries that approve of homosexuality, but there is no legal force in the country, but self-governments such as the capital city are expanding the system to confirm the same sex partnership.
The court rejected this and confirmed the reality of women's actual marriage.
It seems to be the first court ruling that recognized the legal protection of the gay Capule.
The failure to recognize the rules of civil law and of marriage for reasons of the same sex is due to the failure of the country to make a complaint for damages, such as rape.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights guarantees of sexual minorities and to deepen the debate on the other sides of the legal system that recognizes many families.
Women have been living with them for about seven years and have also obtained marriage certificates in the United States, but have been destroyed by an act of misconduct, and the prosecutor has asked for compensation for damages to the two partners.
The court recognized the fact that two people were living together and that the reality of the actual marriage of men and women was never changed.
It is a formal decision to extend the right to marriage in terms of social security.
More importantly, it showed the interpretation of article 24 of the Act that "the freedom of marriage" was meant to be based solely on mutual consent.
The fact that there were two sexes, "because there was no idea of the same marriage at the time, is not explained even to the pleasure of denying the same marriage."
"The law does not define the same marriage," and it is expected that it will be the pursuit of the same-sex marriage in every country.
On the other hand, because of the fact that sex is not recognized, there is a difference in the benefits of legal protection between men and women.
Even though men and women recognize the same reality, it's not easy to distinguish between right and right to protect.
In a national family-based survey of married women who should be legally recognized by law, there is also a change in the conscience of the national population.
As the diversity of lifestyles progresses, the law is attached to traditional family images, and the rights of people who do not have it will be taken away.
The fact that marriage is not a legally recognized "wife" does not make any distinction in the tax system, nor does it have a common right, nor does it still have a lot of restrictions.
In the examination of the same sex, there is a need to look at family law from various viewpoints, both the extent and the extent of the rights of the actual marriage.
A number of women are suspected of being prosecuted by a court of law in Israel.
The trial is conducted by a jury of the baseball players of the Idea University, who are accused of committing sexual acts against a number of women.
"On Friday, after the final testimony and debate of 0 days, Judge Cray Conawai began to comment on the fate of Conway (23).
"The woman from the village of Konaway said that she had been sexually abused after sending Conaway to her home in the car.
The two of them put their faces together because they met at the site of the meeting, and three weeks later, Concawei sent her pictures to the woman.
Concaway is asked for six sexual crimes against women between the ages of 20-3 and 20-8, but this woman is one of them.
The investigation party claimed that the woman resisted when the conquistadores tried to force Escarlet and Konawei to rape women.
The defense party followed the woman's conflicting claims and memories and said that she was not regretting having had a physical relationship.
[Instinct] Co-instinctively, a comment about your own departure is "to get back in the summer" - Yahoo! News
Three large islands have failed in the final war this year and have lost the possibility of entering the CS in their own power.
If the four remaining gods win all three of them, they'll change their position.
After the trial in Selemoni (50) the co-authorate of the city was not able to win the final war, and he was not satisfied that he was unable to determine the position, and this resulted in the responsibility as a supervisor."

There's another conclusion, "I'm going to try to get our pensions back in the summer."

"On September 27th Newport"
The deep pollution of the Earth of man's mind is evident in the motions.
The Sydney Harbor is one of the world's largest hubs of operahouses, sugar-keys, Lunapark, and a well-known hardware store.
But there's the truth under the bridge.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 percent of Olympics are contaminated each year.
Because of this statistics, one of our biggest sights is one of the uncleanest places.
According to a new title film on Sydney Harbor, Australia's most popular city-based street, drinking water, bottle bags, pet bottles, some missing dogs and shoes, and many of the animals' deaths -- all of them flow into Sydney Harbor through the water that flows through the road.
It's the biggest reason in the inside of the water is plastic.
Unfortunately, in a film released on September 27th of the world's vision, Dr. Catherine Daffon, Vice-President of the Sydney Harbor Research Programme, says, "This is a paradox."
It's really beautiful to see, but it's one of the rivers that we've been transformed and contaminated, even on the coast of the country.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms always appear to flow into the water, most of which are flown into Sydney Harbor because of the water flow.
"The heavy rain has dropped several times, but the next Sydney Harbor was... terrible," said Dr. Daffon.
Two thirds of the contamination are flown from the water that flowed through the road.
But like one of the peaks of the mountains, the more serious problem is that 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the sea under this Sydney Harbor are being added to the sea.
"I don't really think we should go to the sea, but I don't know what's going on there or what's not true," said David Manley, King Richard Nicolas of Onner, who only collects about 500 kilograms of plastic a year.
If most people know what's going on in the water, they're going to be really different.
But more than half of all that we're finding is the binium bag.
We're going to use at least half of the plastics.
No one can believe that Sidney Harbor is coming up with all this plastics and jewelry right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders of the Oshan Protect, said that it would be possible for local residents and tourists to reduce their water-flowing plastics and paints.
"We should start from the source," he says.
We're going to reduce the use of plastics, we're going to risk better, and eventually we're going to get to the sea, so we're not going to get any more awareness of what's going on in the drain.
Because 50 percent of the oxygen we consume comes from the ocean, and it's going to kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide, and it's food source.
But we're renovating Sydney Harbor and bringing it back to the old side, but it's very simple.
Killing the sea is a matter of killing people.
In addition to the public and event in which the Australians are aware of the environmental protection of the environment and the impact of the natural environment on the reduction of drinking substances, a new study on plastics and mentalhers has been published this month, in parallel with the open and random timing of this film by TOMRA of the risk company.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of children between 12 and 18 years of age, 82 percent of them are disappointed with plastics, and 25 percent think that plastics are the cause of adult problems.
In the same study, both parents and parents had a problem with plastics at the 4th floor of their minds, and 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed said that they feel uncomfortable about the amount of plastics coming into the sea.
Most of the students said they wanted something about plastics, but they didn't know how to change it, and it was going to be an eco-infection.
The former Downsing power plant, which has been smoking since October, has been in the news.
"The smoke from the old Donzing Power plant, which was started in July, has been in the city of Donzing.
On 26 days, the state electricity announced the release of the oil spill at the former Dungsten Power Station, which is located in Dozing City.
I'm looking forward to the end of the work until the end of March 202.
The solution is in two books that were used to extract the gas from the power supply, which is about 80 meters high.
In three books, the book was withdrawn to "99."

The old Domsing power plant started driving in 967 years, and the engine stopped in 89 years and 2,3 in 20-5 years.
It's located on the corner of the port of Donson, and it's located some 225,000 square miles [22,000 sq km] of soil.

Water companies in the outlying city of Guangdong are conducting a survey of the "land-based products" and the "fish and fish" (with the city's ancient cities).
The school began in June.
I've learned about the mining industry, and I've learned more about the water industry.
We talked about consumer news at the workshop, and we tried the product.
He also examined the Nagets that used the ass, but he used flies because of the special smell of fish.
Mr. Al-Qaida (17) said, "It's nice to have a lot of food to eat, even if the fish is hard to eat."

I'm not sure what's going on here, but my father taught me important things as a social worker.
I was told that he was either gay or bicycling, and when he was very hurt, he said, "I didn't think he was gay, but he didn't.
And then, in the year two and three, when I was saying, "Let's get out of here, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
I've learned from my father's play, and I've learned from him.
I don't have a lot of people who don't see where I'm going to read the news, but I've been touched by the news because I've actually been on TV and I've been on the news since I've been on the news.
I thought that the author's personality and sense would come out when he was reading the novel, and I thought that Mr. Matsuko Delaks had appreciated "the best reading of the real news."
When I read the news, I feel like I'm great, and I feel like I'm a sense.
It's been developed by watching the father's dances, movies, televisions, and contemporary dramas during his early years.

Workshop in the mirror.
A workshop on the role and effect of the five instruments played by the team, which was presented for 26 days, at the University of Sponsorship.
The group workshop, which was held on 26 days in the Middle East School, was held on 26 days of the 20th "Education and General Service of Education" in the 9th year.
All the students attended, learned about the effects of the musical instruments and how they functioned in addition to their 300-year history and their births.
In the workshop, the members of the OB's Institute of Art Balloons, three lines, three lines, too deep, too deep, and they're playing the ball, and they're talking about the role that each of the instruments in the club plays.
The Board made a statement about the group's attractiveness by Mrs. Shango of the OB meeting, who left the city of Kung-khungu.
In this workshop, I learned about how five types of instruments are expressed in dances in three components of the group.
The three lines are explained that the movement of the hearts and emotions of the people who are present together with the song is what the fool is attracted to by the rhythms of the song and the triangular line.
In the last half, even though the students actually touched the instrument and felt that it was the music, they felt the charm as the instrument.
This project is being implemented to give attention to many students and to many students about "school" with a musical instrument, and this is the first time in the ancient world.

What's going to happen to the U.S.W.R.R. in 2020?
The WRC World Cup is one of the four World Championships held by the International Automobile Union (FIA).
Since 1973 it has become the world's highest-ranking, historical and traditional Lary, and not just a closed road, it is called a more violent motor vehicle race, to travel at a high speed in various ways, such as the railways and snow roads.
In June 2018, Toota returned to 2 sessions and received a WRC-Manufacturing title since 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Committee was convened to launch a sad start.
As a result, it was decided that the World Motorsport Council, which is the highest resolution of the International Automobile Union (FIA), would launch the 2020 WRC Japan Round.
I am talking about Japan's launch of both knowledge and knowledge of Japanese horticulture, and the representative of Toyota GAZOO Racing WRT.
● Love for the knowledge of the capital of the capital of the village
"We welcome the 2020 Japan launch of the FIA World War II (WRC).

I'm sure Tasmania demon will be a trap for cancer.
Tasmaniaa devil may have had cancer cancers, and researchers are opening up a crisis that is likely to result in major changes in the treatment of patients.
Medical researchers have pointed out how some cancer cells comouflage.
Researchers have discovered that the same process is taking place in Tasmaniaaville and Het.
In this finding, new ways of treating cancer patients are expected.
What's the point of contact with Tasmaniaabil and Hitler?
It's an invisible cancer cell.
The study team, including a researcher at the Peter McCalam Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there is cancer that does not respond to the immunization procedure, there is a great potential for a significant change in the treatment of the cancer.
It is also possible that Tasmaniab will be able to hold the key to the high face of death that threatens the future of the pre-destructive Tasmanian devil.
In this study, a group of cancer cells in the liver and in the pancreas were not responding to the Marcer's reaction to the use of a combination of pumps called the PRC2, and the immune system was not attacking the cancer.
This is a major problem for the treatment of small cell cancer, neuroscientists, and mercenary cells called skin cancer.
Professor Mark Dosson, a researcher for Peter McCalam, said that "the most important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are suffering from immunization therapy."
It can re-use the next treatment, re-activise Marker, known as MHC, and enable the immune system to detect cancer cells.
"There is a possibility of a significant impact on lung cancer patients," said Professor Dosson.
"Blood cancer is a disease that spreads around the world.
And maybe you can get some better treatment.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used in the treatment of Tashmaniaa devil face cancer, which is also a case where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's amazing that the same process is going to take place (in the blood of Het and Tasmaniab),” said Professor Dosson.
"To date, it was very rare to treat Tasmaniaabil's cancer.
However, if a drug that has an effect on the liver can be used to tasmaniab, it may be possible to help control the liver. "
Scientists are also confused about the great planet around the planet.
Scientists have discovered and amazed the current solar system that covers the current understanding of planet formation, which is around a small planet known as the Red Star, 30 years from Earth.
On 26 September 2019, the Great Gas Planet GJ3512b was released, a artistic image that revolves around its star, the Red Star.
It's usually the largest planet around it.
But in this case, the size of stars and planets is not very large.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 per cent of the sun's size, but the planet around it has at least half the mass of our solar system's largest planet.
"Yes, it's still surprising. "The study published in Science Science led this study, said the heavenly physicist Fán Carlos Morales of the University of Catalunya University in Spain.
The theoretical design model shows that normally low-quality stars are made up of small planets like the planet Earth and the small ocean planets, and this discovery was surprising.
In this case, a huge gas planet like a tree was found around a very small planet.
The planet, which is made up of gases like Mars, was discovered using a telescope of the skyscraper of the Caribbean, Spain.
It's about 204 days, and it's about 204 days.
The red star is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
GJ3512 is not just smaller than our sun, it's about the size of the giant planet, and it's only 35 percent larger than the planet.
It's slightly darker than the sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 degrees Kelvin (6380 degrees 3527 degrees W).
That's why they're coloring red.
On the one hand, there is a sign that the two planets are currently orbiting the planet, and three planets are likely to be released from its system in the past, which explains the orbital orbit of the planet's orbit around the planet, said Mr. Morares.
The planets are made of the same spheres that make up the stars around them.
The most powerful model of planet formation called the "coac collection" model is that the earth is made up of solid cells within the sphere, which are made by the attraction of the planet's waves.
This special planet system could be described by using what is called a self-containing model called a self-containing disorder.
"In this case, the number of original planetary systems that have only been created may have been smaller and less temperature than we thought."
This is a state of uncertainty, and there's a possibility that some high levels of gravity will appear.
These pieces grow until they collapse, and they form planets.
Deli's employee, let's eat a cup of coffee mixed with the rest of the day.
The Marion Security Office, Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is said to have fed the dipping of the woked beans together.
In the woodland, Kasandra Ani Medina Hernández (38) of Albania was accused of suspecting the transfer of methamphetamine from high-crime drugs to others.
The suspect is due to an incident in the Griftway Food Shop in Jefferson on 9 September.
According to the estimates made by OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Delhi to see that Medina Hernández was making a cup of coffee.
According to the declaration, the victim had not done methamphetamine so far, and said to the investigator, "I thought it would change my mind after I ate my mouth, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman came back to work, she was in a bad mood.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, in the previous local hospital where a woman went, it was determined that there was a possibility that methamphetamine was mixed in the diphtheria.
According to Za Smoking Gang, another Slift Wei employee said that Medinna Hernández said that the victim's food was "injected with drugs."
According to an article in Oregon Life, a video from Dery's detention video says that Medina Hernández is taking something out of the Brazil area from behind the camera.
And then he got up and put his nose up and walked to the table and put a cup of coffee in a little paper bag.
The police said that they were placing something out of Brazzar on the roof.
According to the Oregon Stateman Journal, the security officer said he doesn't think there's been any contaminated food in the moment.
Medinna Hernández is held in Marion Prison instead of $52 million.
According to Smoking Gang, the long record of the arrests of Medina Hernández has so far been a crime of violence, rape, theft, meta-methamine possession and possession of weapons of control.

The hospital's "reforming the need" is in the hospital.
There were five hospitals in the hospital, which were announced on 26 days to reorganize the labor department.
There are 38-5% of the 3 medical units involved in the investigation, and there are 3 out of every 10 countries that have already decided to manage and move.
The hospital's name in the hospital is published in the National Hospital for East Asian Hospital Hospital (three-storeys), Multi-City Hospital, Small City Hospital (small City), Regional Medical Works for the Development of the Ivorian Hospital (Irish City), and the South Pacific Hospital in Zingun.
The long-term urban hospitals and small urban hospitals have been developing plans to build a new hospital in several cities in the east of the city, and thousands of Lisunpur hospitals have decided to move to the long-term São Paulo city.
The hospital has been operating at the center of the city, including Kea, which has been operating in the past few years.
The President of the House of Commons stressed that "the city is run alone and has a way to connect to the hospital in nearby cities, and that the hospital must remain forever for the people," and he expressed a negative view of the re-organization and the organization.
The head of the East Asian Hospital's office said, "I don't hear anything from you," and he said, "I'm going to take a positive look at the regional medical adjustment meeting and respond to the interests of the debate."
The Organisation for the Promotion of the Regional Medical System (Tongying) that runs the Ivan Lilongwe Hospital is "not that the public decides the direction of the public hospital by mechanical means, but that it is requested to be examined by the local medical institutions in all directions."
The director of the medical school, who explains the country's views on the medical sector, wanted to hear a quick talk about the future hospital transport.
In the case of medical science, you might ask for a medical examination or a reduction in the number of diseases."
First of all, there were 30 suspects, three of them were killed by the S.A. News.
In the case of a three-year-old male in the city of Zhaoqu, "4" who seemed to have killed himself in July to show what he had received, it was evident that the third committee of the city that examined the facts of the beginning was on 27 days, the result of hearing from the first generation, and that there were about 30 suspects of male students.
In the future, we'll see if the facts are true or if they're true.
On the same day, the Third Committee opened a five-day meeting, and the Committee and two lawyers joined the entire committee to hear the results of their joint hearings.
According to the Third Committee, the students were placed in the toilet and asked for cash.
The secret of the Royal Family: a very popular user of the Royal Chamber.
The Royal Family must have traveled hundreds of times throughout the world as a part of the civil service.
It's usually easy to use your own tools to move kings around the world for important events and events.
Of course, there's a right to use your own tools.
It's not a long list of exits, it's not a limit to the number of handbags, but it's like the Royal Family just likes it, and sometimes it's possible to invite guests, including unexpected passengers.
According to the recently released channel 5 documents, the queen and Prince Philipp are not the only users of the royal machine.
In the Royal Fleet's secret campaign, the queen's pilots showed that most of the guests, including family, are busy.
Bob Shills said, "Sometimes, like a very big prince's client, there's a very big Royal Doug."
It's not surprising that the queen's dog is famous and wants to take a lovely pet with her.
Queen Elizabeth is said to have had more than 30 coggie dogs since she was a child.
In 2007, it was said that Monty, Ema, Renet, Willow and Holly had five dogs.
The other five cokespaniel's busts, oxo, flashy, scissors, five of the Spanish, four of the Ducksfonts and the Dogs, four of the Belgians, and four of the Candy's.
The staff that works with the royal service will be very busy.
The King's staff is being watched as he leaves the dog before the ride and asks him to make use of it.
Unfortunately, it hasn't happened before.
The program also found out that the queen's official travel supplies are known as a lot of shocking.
According to the organizer, "in the United Kingdom of 44,000 miles of 1953, there were 12 tons of royal supplies."
It'll be well understood if it's equal to the size of two inches.
But it's not just the queen who likes fashion.
Mrs. Kenbridge also says she wants to be alone when she wears her shoes, so she says, "Sit with her clothes."

And all of Japan's 2019 players have won by men's Dublins, and the T.T. has decided to fight since the end of August at the Trig2nd season.
The tools used for the mountains include: Dignix05, Back: Dignix80 (FL).
It's a mountain that enjoys the Rally fight in the middle of the stage.
I used to use tennis, but I changed my lab when dignitx came in, which made it possible to focus on the ball and attack the game.
And that kind of love stuff in the mountains is a list band used in the experiment.
"There was a time when the back came up in World Trades. At the same time, the list band was fixed, and the head of the hand seemed to be stuck together, so when it was tried, it didn't look like the top of the list band. The list band had a little bit of a feeling, but (Laughter)"

I'm looking at a play with explosives in the Trig2nd season.

In the first wave when the Communist Party was advancing in Dipsaus, Jack Edwards, elected president of the Federal Republic of Arab States, who had been withdrawn for the period, died on Friday.
Mr. Edward announced that he had died in his own home at Feahop's home at the end of the battle.

Michel Obama highly appreciated Megan Mark in his favorite internship on Thursday, and called Mrs. Sex Princes "the kind of head of mind that's better than the world."
Mrs. and Prince Harry met with his son, Artie Harrison Mount Batten=Winzer, on a 10-day formal visit to South Africa, to the youth reception this week, and to the opama's department.
Mrs. President, "Thank you very much for breaking the old tradition and for making the world better.
Mrs. Obama posted a picture of a megagan with the Department of Economic Affairs, and she added: "Even if she talks with the Ministry of Finance, and supports girls in the world who want to learn how to deal with it, she's encouraging many people."
In September, he interviewed Mrs. Obama as a guest editor of the British version of Watch Tower.
In that frank conversation, the President-in-Office said that she had changed herself to a mother and a mother.
In the interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Mother, it's like I'm in the upper class."
My work as a mother taught me that most people want to find themselves and take the right distance to grow.
It's not the idea of a child as a parent, it's not the horrors of his childhood, it's to find out who they are.
Mrs. Obama, who actually knew the sponsors who were putting on a spot in the world, gave a little advice to the Prime Minister in the interview of Good HousesKipping.
"Sometimes the pleasure of myself and of the people around us may feel very great."
So, I don't want to be hasty about doing anything, but my biggest advice.

Washington (AP) - The Alcohol Drinking Board of Washington rejected the claim that Washington should refer to local transfer licenses for alcohol.
The Board of Appeals, three members of the House, two former judges and two Jewish leaders, complained that most of the complainants had no residence or fixed property in Washington State.
According to Washington Post, this is the second time the claim to monitor the removal of alcohol from the hotel, based on the state law that the applicant's "applicability" is required.
The first complaint made in the summer last year was that President Tranp's suspicions and repeated frauds were contrary to state law.
The complaint was rejected because the evidence was already accepted.
It's a second form of complaint to update the license.
Bentrey's baby "Freing Bees" is the first bite!
I'm going to tell you what's going on here.
In May 2019, in the construction site of Bentrey, England, food was started, and in September the same year, the hachimitis was harvested.
The workers who worked in the club did not lose their staff, but they collected more than 100 bottles of hammocks from one of their boxes.
How did Bentrey get to eat?
I'd like to see this!
So this is where Pentrelle's hand is.
Peter Bosch, the production department manager of Ventrey, comments on the following.
"In order to contribute to the biodiversity security of the area, first of all this year, we set up a box first in the vast soil of the club factory.
From the wildflowers planted in the soil and from the surrounding mountains, the bees have observed the variety of flowers that they gather.
It's a great idea to know that this place is suitable for food, and it's going to be great in the next year.
Bentrey has advanced a wide range of activities to become a top of the Sustainable Automotive Makers through the club and the public industry, and it's part of the development of honey.
The staff are also actively supporting me.
It's a great surprise to have received the first one, and next year it's a plan to set up more boxes and increase the quantity of the pentreams.
It's going to be a little bit of a walk, but it's going to be a security of the biodiversity of the area.
In May 2019, I started the feeding of 120,000 franchise Bees.
And in September of the same year, over one summer, we finished the work of extracting the rubber from the oven, cutting the rubber into a distance from the air, and then we had a bottle of broken rubber.
You can see these pendulum bottles and packs.
The design of the label was designed by the designer who was responsible for the intelligence of the pentree.
The bottled hammocks are not only served by staff but are given to important customers and customers who visit the club.
The United Kingdom is a country that cares about time.
Of course, the nice fennelty of the hammocks and the nice fennelty of the hammocks, like scenes, like the fling bees of the hammocks.
The innocent cribland police are the worst of English reports.
A police officer who was not involved was under arrest for the worst sign in England.
The Creebrand Police report is incorrect, and it's inappropriate for all areas.
The Creebrand police continue to "serious malformation" and the police officer Phil Gomley says.
In the police, five police officers have been replaced for six years and are facing a new call for release.
According to the report, he stopped crime, arrested suspects, and tried to protect the weak.
Phil Gomley of the Police Department said, "We've been doing a lot of damage since we last studied."
Chief of Police, Mike Will, said, "The month has declined for less than a year, but it's "too serious" about their actions, but it's been investigated by a number of unpublicated suspects.
Lieutenant Adrian Roberts, who was arrested for a very serious crime, became a part of the arrest process.
Simon Howard, the police chief, came to the commission for illegal conduct because he was led to commit sexual acts last year.
He turned the police down.
The chief of the security party, Tissbarrey, said, "This is because the police have been officially proven to be corrupt.
Now it's time for the Ministry of the Interior to intervene."
Richard, the police officer, said, "I've been improved, but I have every responsibility for the progress of the reform."
Nancy Parsie: William Bare has become a criminal.
I don't know what's going on here.
Now, we think we're dealing with a hidden incident, and there's a chance that there might be time to investigate," said Mr. Peroshi to CNN's reception.
"I'm going to do what I've started to do, based on the time it's time to find out the facts."
In a report published this week on the White House, it was found that Tranp relied on the President of Ukraine, Walodymil Zerensky, who was elected president of the United States in 2020 and his son, former Vice-President Joe Biiden.
According to the communication record, Mr. Tranp was also aware that he relied on Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal consultants, Sadie Juliani.
Mr. Tramp has denied the wrong.
CNN reported to the tree that he was the first to receive an internal notice on the practice of tramping in Ukraine more than a week ago, as a national security lawyer in the province of justice.
The Ministry of Justice, who was charged as a briefing by the information agents, decided that Mr. Tranp's phone calls should be conducted in a political fund-raising investigation.
On Friday, on the question of whether Mr. Bur should testify, Mr. Peroshi said that he decided who the Special Committee would ask for a witness.
But Mr. Peroshi added that Mr. Bar was a criminal.
Of course, it's been the same before.
"Because the name of the final bar was given," said Mr. Peroshi, and he was touched by the name of the President of Ukraine on the July call with the President of Ukraine.
It is interesting to note that Mr. Bur will be forced to make a decision about the end of this complaint.
Mr. Peroshi said, "I'm very sorry that Mr. Tranp attacked the complainant on Thursday, and that the treatment of Spain was different in the past."
I think the president's statement is completely irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Parosi said that the internal prosecutors have played an important role in the U.S. government's false disclosure and public opinion," and he said, "the fact that the president said that there was nothing wrong with the Government is very damaging to the people who could have provided information to the internal prosecutors."
Mr. Peroshi, who has been investigating the suspicions he has tried to exert pressure on foreign leaders for the sake of the fire and political interests, announced that he is going to conduct formal anti-dumping negotiations with Mr. Tranp, and wrote a historic move.
The content of the communication is included in a statement published in the tree, in which the internal prosecutor claims that Mr. Tranp has used the right to "introduction the Ukraine" for the next 2020 presidential election.
The internal prosecutor also claimed that White House consultants had instructed the stakeholders to remove their contact records from a computer-based computer system and to transfer them to a special-secret information system.
Crystal, Ford, Paris, Christian, Bentece, speed-up ban on driving.
In two months, the Premier's star, a double-speeded premier, Christian Bentek, will be banned from driving.
The 28th-century Ford of Crystal Paris, "20th of May, he drove his pentree and admitted that he had run at 50 miles of the A3 limit in the south-west of London.
In March, the Belgians were filming the speed-resisting camera at a speed of more than 40 miles per hour in the south of London.
Bentek, who lives in Kingstone Hill, may not have to appear in the Court of Justice of Labender Hill this morning.
Even though the judge, who was executed in the beginning of July, continued to give a simple answer to the criminal case, Bentec acknowledged the guilt for both of these offenses.
9.2% of Taiwan's high school students are "experimental" with an undisputed increase of health authority.
The National Health Agency of the Ministry of Health (UNHCR) announced the results of a survey on the sexual experiences of Taiwanese high school students on 26 September.
So the students who answered that there's an experience are 9.2%.
And it turns out that there's no one who's been hiding from about five of them.
The survey was carried out in 2017 for students who reside in high school, professional schools, and high school students.
Compared to the results of the previous survey (15 years), the percentage of students with sexual experiences is reduced by a few percent of the previous.
On the other hand, the answer was that 22.6% of men and women aged 15 to 17 did not have an abortion, and 19.2% of the previous time.
It's 28.8% (formerly 22.6%) and 16.2% (e.g. 14.5%) of women.
The Agency suggests that young people today have a lot of opportunities to get information on the Internet and that it is easy to ignore the wrong information.
They call for accurate knowledge in order to increase the risk of infection, not only of the brain but also of the brain.

Garna: Mr. Coffy Mao, the Bureau of Investigations.
Kofi Mahone, a football manager and employee of the Secondi Hassakas, expresses regret about the composition of the next GFA election committee.
When he questioned the inclusion of Commissioner Frank Davies, he expressed disappointment about it.
Mr. Mahoney said that in the collection of GNAsports, the Commissioner was interested in the results of the investigation, and he said it was fair and suspicious to include the President.
The Board of Auditors should be appointed as a fair neutral member of the Committee from outside which it was previously not interested.
For example, Mr. Davis made a contract as a lawyer with the NC and wrote a letter to Mr. Osei Cook Parma about the award.
My colleague is also known as Olympic Supporters.
For these two reasons, because he has an advantage, the committee should not be allowed to do so, but Mr. Maun replied.
Mr. Maun, when Mr. Fred Papoe, President of the Olympics, attended the Committee, said that he had a difference of interest with the Commissioner's relationship with his club, and that Mr. Parmer had shown that there was prejudice and injustice against him when he attended the Committee.
The members of the committee were scheduled to begin work on the following day and end on October 4 after the usual protocol launched at the GFAA Office on 19 September.
The Commissioner is Mr. Frank Davis, of the Copolate Gabonans Consulart, Mr. Marian Barnoa, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwar, counsel.
The other committee is Mr. Reginald Larie, a marketing professional, and Mr. Richard Akpocavi, a lawyer in sports.
It was found that 54.2% of the SMEs in the well-being are thinking of the bottom-up of the country's low-cost spending target.
In the 20th and 8th years, one of the 9th companies, called the "secure" number, was divided into 5th of the new middle-class right-wing company, and after five years, it was replaced by 3rd of the company's use of illegal companies, and the company's image that suffered from the security of human beings was lifted.
The company, which responded to the call for thousands of hours, had more information links ("00%"), construction (70-6%) and sales (6%").
Over half of the "opposite" divisions were manufacturing (5.9%) and eating and housing services (60-9%) and transport was not the same.
The participants in the conference are looking at "the high-end anti-competitive distribution of the parties and the time, but there are many companies that think they're going to be able to make more and more personal spending."
When the company responded to the "opposite", the amount of money was 895.
"I've heard about the use of companies on March 9th, when I heard that the new use of the company was 6" 3%, the average use was 54.5%, and the irregular use was "5.4% of companies.
I didn't pick up 8-6%.
The number of companies that were "secured" is 44-7%, the average 50-3%, and the irregularity is 3%.
In particular, transport (news 3-3%, medium 37-5%) and construction (new 24%, medium 38%).
86.4% of the entire group had a subject on the board, and in many cases, "the small number of respondents, "the low level of social knowledge " " could not suggest a favourable condition with money. "
As a means of training required for administration, there were many voices calling for the strengthening of the interface and the provision of information for the 2nd (in 3 years after graduation) and the medium-term use.
I also wanted to ask for a delay in the application for students, such as the provision of an out-of-school PR opportunities and support for various Internet chips.
As for the sub-employment and co-operation that the country has proposed in its growth strategy, the answer is, "5 to 3% is already recognized."
"I'm going to accept the future," and I'm going to say, "I'm going to admit it."
The company was 64.4%, the construction (82.8%), the retail (73%) and the manufacturing (72-7%).
The investigation took place on 9 July, on 2 August, with thousands of companies.
298 (29-8%) received an answer.
JR's street wound in the wind and drive again from the beginning (KTntelev) - Yahoo! News
The JR village line, which was linked to road damage by the 17th of January, was reopened from the beginning of the 27th morning.
Since the beginning of the 27th morning, the JR has returned to normal operation.
The JR is located in the middle of the river bank and the railways are affected by the storm, and the infrastructure is flooded.
In the middle of the spring and early spring, the JR trains in the long-distance were reduced in number, and there was still a crisis in the diamonds.
According to the JR-Ni-Ni-Ni's company, the 26-day recovery work was completed and the 27-day train was re-launched.
Tiprik, I've heard a lot about war and war.
"It's a place to see," said Justin Tiprik, who decided the course of the next tournament.
Well, if Wells wins Walavis, it's the hottest win in Paul D, and maybe it'll be certain that he'll be able to win the best win in France or Argentina.
If Australia, which has fought 15 so far, has won the 14th battle against Wells, the Tiprik and the team will be the best 8 front line in England.
"Of course it is, both teams are trying to win and end up on a group top."
The war against (Australia has already had serious consequences, but it has won well in recent years.
I think Australia's going to blame me for the debt, but it's still trying to win again.
Before I came here, I knew this was a mountain.
And I came here, and now it's a real sight.
Wells has just won Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in the World Cup so far, but the win to Warwick has been a three-year-old decision.
And under Wallen Gateland's supervision, the total score for the three teams in the Southern Hemisphere is only seven in the 41st battle.
Wells stopped the 13th battle of Testmatic Australia last November, but Tiprik was a member of a number of the members who won from 9-6 this day in Tokyo's stadium.
Ask him if he didn't want to win any more before he won, and Tiprik said, "It's hard to answer.
Of course, it was a trial, many, many, but I don't know.
And as a result, I've done 15 points at the end of the test, and I've actually seen it as a lot more scholastically.
Wells, to win, the Australian Conbies, Michael Fapper and David Pocock, and Typrik's blackdown battalion, are going to win.
Typrik, who has been experienced in the 67th International Assembly of Tests, has also been aware of the past experiences of both players and of what is expected.
"They're certainly the back players at the world level."
When you fight the backbone of the Worldgras, you always know that you're going to have a hard fight.
They're always the world's top level.
So I'm pretty aware of what's going on.
Pocock is one of the world's back players, and Michael's side is an attackive but he may say that he's going to have a little bit of a place where he needs it.
I think we'd rather fight backloop than fight the world's highest player.
I want to fight my best friend, and if you fight those two, you have to make a deal with yourself.
It doesn't say today's winning level, but it's a big test for us in the World Cup.
It's a big deal.
If you keep up your good paper, you'll be able to keep up with it.

Before the trial, he was convinced that he won the same victory, but in the end, he was tired of saying, "No," as if there were a loud voice like, "No."
When the final toilets were opened, the store was locked in a hole.
The east power, the command of the sea when it's released, is a silent news story about the death of a victim.
The meeting of the Government's small committee to discuss the treatment of the original water treatment in the Tokyo Electricity Island was 27 days later, in the Tokyo port area.
At the 27-day government committee examining the treatment of the water that continues to grow in origin, Tokyo's electricity suggested the planned facilities and specific manuals for depletion of land-based ocean and water.
In view of the risk of exposure to radiation tritiums, it is urgent to stop by checking the material volume and detecting the differences until release.
It is different from what the committee's response to today's meeting said, "How much time is it going to take or how much time it is going to take to make it clear that "the work of the Fascist is not going to recover."
We should consider social time."
East Enders, Netavare: Ben's kisses the column after Whiteney's explosive news.
In East Enders, Karam Haywei (Tone Cray) was so shocked by the sudden explosion of the Whiten Din (Sone Macgarty) that he was able to get back to his loved ones, and that was before the intense tension between Karam and Ben Michael (Max Bowen) and the explosion.
But does love begin with two people, or will it be a time to regret this hot moment?
And since the help of the poor Bobby Bill (Cray Millner Russell) has helped him, the relationship between two people has gradually improved, and he has recently become weak, and he has been eager to see the beautiful side of Ben.
Tonight, Whitney's gonna be better off on his way back to rest.
It was obvious to her that she was very effective when she realized that the person who was supposed to be a sad marriage and a flowering woman had gone away from Walford.
When Whitney came home, she was able to share a piece of bread with her.
But, by the way, Whitney knows the new facts and adds a hand to the column, and it's nice.
The column is moving, and Jamie Boswick is worried about the column that drinks on the Queen Vic.
The sensitivized column goes into Ben's side, takes over everything that happened and blames Ben.
Ben used to calm down his anger and calm down his words of comfort, and at least two people said that he had a kiss.
But what do two people do with this?
They tried to date the next week, but Ben's getting the material to think about the relationship, and it's going to be all that he's doing together.
But when he stood up to Guy's father and put his new confidence in him, he decided to fight to get what he wanted and what he needed.
This kissesod from East Ender is sent to BBC at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, 27 September.
If you have a "9th class" of Ghara, will you be willing to give it to your client?
One of the problems with anti-Socialism is the cross-cutting problem that has highlighted the strength of anti-Socialism.
When the President of the House of Commons met on 22 July, he said, "The company's 9 talent is one, and it's not all."
If you have 9 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it seems to have contributed from the customer to the Gibbin, and the investor's opinion that the tax will be taxed is also streamed on Twitter and over 30,000 times retweeted.
If there was a "9:1" in the garage, would there be taxes and taxes?
She heard from the old tax collector.
● Neither is the legal purpose of taxation.
I'm going to say that the division of the garage is a little bit more about the tax.
It's not a personal interest, it's not a legal cause, it's not a tax.
If there's a share of one million jobs in the world, there's a 9:1-year-old business that sells 1 million dollars, and the cost of 1 million dollars is 9 million dollars.
This is a legal tax.
Of course, this is how you're making a tax announcement, and you're already taking legal taxes.
And even if you were wondering about sharing, you're not claiming that the money actually comes from being different than the money that should be given.
And I think they're selling the money they've got.
If you don't recognize it, you're not going to give it to each other if you're alone.
There is clearly a price (e.g., sale of non-professional goods) that has been traded at a distance from the current price for the purpose of avoidance of the tax.
But, like this time, the third party will not be able to determine how much the taxable price has been paid for what both parties have not been willing to negotiate.
And I'm going to say that I'm going to have a payroll on my own.
[Material tax author] Security has been registered in 2008 since the University of Taxors' University (very often) and has completed the banking function (books, financial statements, tax laws, tax laws, tax laws, the quality of the tax with respect to the maintenance of the tax).

It's a very simple explanation for the economy's initials.
The White House, there's a big panic.
The White House stakeholders have been struggling to resist the pressure of the new democracies, explaining that there is a "big panic" this week about the lack of plans to deal with the new reality.
The people near the White House said that there is an increase in "severe, insecurity and anxiety" about the situation in the Western world, and the possibility that internal prosecutors may be able to make a big difference between the president and the people around them.
The guy said, "I don't have any self-esteem."
The White House stakeholders had no clear plan for this situation, and the usual approach that the president had come to understand is not likely to apply, because this claim was very serious, and it was not so sure how to proceed, and it seemed that the next reported news could not be completely eradicated."
Other people who have been involved in this debate have expressed their concern that the president's reaction to the ongoing "inconsistencies" is to raise the perception that he's not going to be able to do it, and that he's not going to be able to do anything about it.
Other news reports say that President Pressiers are busy every day, and that the presidents are also close to the president's side, who are watching a "active" move.
It's an unforeseeable act of tramp, it's taking a car into consideration of the possibility of an unexpected attack, and it's becoming increasingly critical of the president and the politicians in the electoral year.
Tranp faced the greatest threat in the term of office of the President, and has turned his hand into an attack and a defensive hand to restore the strategy he has decided to succeed in the Russian investigation of Robert Morar.
Tranp was interested in the campaign of the Democratic Party and President John Biiden, and tried to undermine the confidence of the internal prosecutors for the party's motive for the party's investigation.
But many of the White House people are suffering from moral testing, and they are starting to feel different this time.
The President of the Force is Brand, but he looked at the water reporters' meetings, and people spoke about the situation.
It seems that the tramp was not in the heart of answering questions about Ukraine, which was fun to ask questions about Russia's investigation.
The internal prosecutor claims that there are people who do not have direct information about contact with President Tranp and Mr. Vorojimier Zerensky, and the President of Ukraine, who are convinced that the internal prosecutor's credibility can be reduced.
Moreover, the president's attack is going to happen well, but it will increase the support level in order to protect them.
However, politicians from the nearby White House point out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and that new supporters will not be able to win.
In particular, if it is like to separate the news in four hours, "the first four months, it is not good to focus on the presidential election."
Another information that claims the bullet will help the president is that the President's response does not completely take into account the uncertain elements.
Remember, White House staff are asking for advice on how to prepare a team to deal with the storm.
According to the stakeholders who explained the bone of this plan, this approach is still the first step, but it is not yet clear how such a strategy decision-making process will be carried out or how it will be implemented.
However, there is a recognition that organized law and communication strategies, and that there is a need for clear leaders to organize advertising activities actively in order to counter the efforts of the public and the media to combat the activities of the Democratic Party.
According to this situation, it is clear from the fact that President Mike Pompeo and President Stephen Muñezin have said that they do not have to publish a memo on the communication with President Wkrena of Tranp after 48 hours, but that the long-term strategic perspective is clear.
Now, more than the time of Robert More's investigation, which has been reported to be in the most undisputed form of prosecution, the press is now looking forward to a higher degree. According to the people involved, there are people who are likely to be involved in the outbreak of the plague, called the external pitball of the tramp, and Corrie Lundowski, who is serving the Prime Minister for the Elections.
But it's not true that Luwandouski is showing himself to be the leader of such a deal, says NBC News.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and the policy, but I have not talked to the president and the party about participating in this false talk team," he said.
The outside attorney, Jay Secrow, also involved in the operation of the bomb during the Molar investigation.
And for the NBC news, the secrou said, "The problem will be handled properly."
The Emmet Flad, who led the White House to the end of the test, was following the Clinton bombing, and the experience of Pat Sipron, now in the White House legal interview, is lacking, and there is now a lack of lawyers who have experienced the bombing.
Information on the White House strategy is generally recognized by stakeholders as being far away from the establishment of a private recruitment and strategic policy team, but it is organised and all can lead to a political response and fight.

● Couples of couples who get married from distant love
You're starting to associate with a half-year-old man with a distant love.
And there's a saying, "You're going to be tested far away, and you're going to be stronger."
Professor of Forestry (under the river) is known as the Ancket Research conducted by Denatrabel, who responded to 1147 of August 2017, but according to data, 16% of the couples who were divorced from distant love were married.
And because love is a five-year-old, it's about seeing each other, listening to the voice, holding hands, holding hands, shaking hands, and sneezing.
But if you're far away from love, most of the cases are heard by phone.
It's a difficult possibility to keep in touch with your hearing condition.
There's also a problem with cost.
When you go to your partner's home, it takes time and effort to move around, and the rest of the day you're tired of your work.
When I get back, I'm going to feel terrible.
- Well, if it's a long way off, will you?
I think it's better if I don't see you in the woods, but I can't do it in the long run, or if I don't get to see you.
Or if you marry after a year or two, you'll get back from work.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing site.

Devin Winnes, the Democratic Party that called for "Tranp's Nade"
Mr. Devin Hannes (California Communist Party) seems unable to bear the idea that President Donald Tranp is being investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment to protect the president, President Ned accused the Democratic Party of trying to take photos of the President.
The Deputy Special Committee for the Information Committee of the People's Party has announced in its opening statement that Tranp relied on the presidential candidate Joe Biiden and his son to investigate internal proceedings.
The co-chairman said that Ukraine's left party and the media asset created a "grotic show" and blamed the president's democracies who wanted to see the whole picture.
"The Democratic Party of this Special Committee actually contacted people who thought they were Ukrainians in order to get a photo of the Tranp. "
It's true that the Democratic Party is so proud of this president and that there's a chance within a year, and it's all going to be asked.
At the end of President Janniss' criticism, senior political analyst Jennifer Bendley of Hafpopost made it clear that the Democratic Party's members are trying to find the truth.
The answer that has so far been answered is only by Senator Jim Hayms of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but for many others, there is no doubt that the answer of the House of Commons is absolute truth.
The media dotcom argues that Mr. Jenniss' recent comments were written in a discussional style document, which is not related to "more and more unverified details".

Origami, Wallet and Realcards.
Press Watch - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is a possible application to add payment by Origami Pay, which can be made (move) by connecting funds and financial institutions.
I'll add the charge.
We also start financial services with partner companies, finance, investment, and insurance.
I mean, you can use the financial resources that you pay, you can move, you can charge, you can borrow, you can go back, you can use the Origami Wallet.
Origami Financial Services, the representative of the company, said that Mr. Bremmer had to live in a variety of financial problems, such as years of money and low money, to solve the problems of young generations and create a new financial service, "for example, those who were far away from their financial situation and who wanted to help with the same service as those who had not yet received the favor."
Origami Wallet's advantage is that if you have Origami ID from the application to the transaction, you can get information from time to time.
I also explained, not only the Origami app, but also the opening of a partner application, but also the use of the Origami app without the Origami app.
In the case of finance, it shows the functions that can be used when making decisions.
And even if there was a need for funds, they would finish with Origami's application from the application.
As regards insurance, it is a party company that presents the first life of Nissey and the first life.
So we're talking to these two companies, and we're seeing data and knowledge, and we're planning to launch security goods along the way to life.
The provision of financial services is going to start and expand, through the registration of the necessary administrative services.
"Origami Technologies" is a new business for the effective use of data.
Origami also announced on the same day that companies are digitalising customer points by their own Pay by means of Origami's decision-making functions, and that they are supporting the new Origami Technologies, including the data stored, to support the effective use of data.
The Origami Network, which refers to the Origami Network and decision-making activities, is recognized as the issue of effective data activity, such as the acquisition of unstructured data on sale and the creation of a real society, such as the collection and processing of its data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports the acquisition and analysis of non-construction data, along with the data created by its company Pay.
They are contributing to the development and transformation of new business models (Directal Transformation) that use digital technology and data.
Origami, the representative of the company, said, "Now many companies are collecting a lot of data and making customer contacts," and "the next phase, how to develop a business model using data."
"I want to create the next phase's innovation with the data built on Origami Network," he said.
The details of the specific service content will be published on a regular basis.
In addition, in 2019, the Origami Conference highlighted the fact that the future arrangements of Origami, such as the rain, would send a coupon to Smaho, which was an active technology.
And even now, the Origami Pay is making a full recovery, but it's being ascertained as a system for the use of the rules.
In addition, we have promoted regional activity and cooperation with the Watch Tower Society, and we have encouraged them to act as a support service.

And he said, "If there's any activity that's going to be able to expand the meeting."
After the explosion, the Korean Institute of Art Exchange presented a message from the Chief of Health at the end of the Chucho International Institute for Thinking.
Renewable potential for emissions reduction in biofuels studies
In recent years, electric cars and tesra trucks, although the Sami are independent of the news, are the only one that can be refuelable by energy.
However, Alberta University professors developed a technique that could be used as a jet fuel for renewables.
Dr. David Brassler, Professor of Alberta's Department of Environment Science, started this project in 2003.
The study room of the professors is developing carbon dioxide fuel from such substances as esteran, fertilization, and canola oil.
This technique differs from that of ethanol and other biofuels, which can be used for production of low-quality petroleum oils, which is less than 85% of carbon emissions than oil-based fuels, and which can be used in the production process in other industries.
This technique will also work again on carbon dioxide existing in the oil base fuel.
Dr. Brassler said, "This technique has been achieved in the first century, in fact, by the carbon dioxide of the dizelgasoline. "
A new choice for the use of biofuels is that the next biofuel technology has a low-temperature and unsecured approach, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like no harm," said Dr. Brassler.
It's not as valuable as diesel, but there's a more necessary condition.
In Dr. Brassler's studio, the jet is now on two choices as biofuels.
One of the low-risk applications requires another treatment of carbon dioxide and added water to the biofuels.
The second option is to continue to study chemical reactions that have already been developed partially, even under heat.
Dr. Brassler said about the second option, "You can also try the atomic cells to change chemical reactions a little bit."
This option is very risky.
While airlines, Canadians and U.S. Army are increasing investment in potential options again, Forge Hydrocorbons of Alberta University is involved in production.
"They're predicting that in the future no one will ever be able to study carbon tax," said the doctor.
I'd like to prepare for the worst case.
At present, Forge has worked near Edmonton's waste management center, and recently, 25 million meters of production facilities were built in Sonbra, Ontario, to support the construction of Rockide Martin from 40 million meters.
The factory is scheduled to produce about 1 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Dr. Brassler says that the amount of carbon is 85%, but there is no reason for a reduction in fuel delivery and production methods.
Mr. Brassler says, "as a tech house."
My job is to make an option so that I can make my decisions and make multiple choices.

[Hungary Experienced 2020] The North Sea Public High School is trying to stop the book's sex series (resemam) - Yahoo! News
The North Sea Education Commission issued a manual for the selection of high school students on 26 September 2019 (order and 2 years).

Until the 2019 student elections, they had set up a separate section on the curriculum, but they were concerned about the need for proper consideration of the individual sexual orientation and the diversity of self-recognition, and in the 2020 student elections, they removed the "sex" column from the form of the curriculum.
In general, academic research of students' choice is in five national languages, mathematics, social sciences, English lessons.
The English hearing test is included during the English investigation period.
There's a 50-minute study time for students.

Boris Johnson warned that if the Bridget was covered, the British would face violence like Los Angeles, the Prime Minister would call for calmness.
When the two national votes were doubled, there was a danger of "national violence" in the country, and last night the senior minister said.
The Prime Minister's senior officials warned that England would face the violence of the French Golden Best Movement, with economic inequality, and the "992-year-old Losanzells' violence against citizens.
Mr. Johnson said that "we need to control our anger" against the political words spoken in a strong debate, but he claimed that we should stop using the word "the North."
In addition to the fact that the Prime Minister had told him to return the silence, some tweets said to the Times: "There has never been anything like that in this country, Jille John (Gold Best Movement) and Lasanzels violence in 992 years."
The only reason nationals have not yet done so is that there is no violence in this country.
Some of them already have a vision of the yellowest movement that they have coded their phone and set up demos, and then they have a number of populist leaders who use their own dirty hands to beat people.
In Los Angeles, "992 years old, a black taxi driver, Rodney King, was attacked by four white police officers who had beaten King, who were convicted of being convicted by the jury.
In this year, a French anti-government democracy, wearing a yellow vest, has been causing confusion and destruction in the city of Paris for over six weeks.
It pointed out that if the British failed to remove the EU, "trust in our country's political system would be disastrously lost."
"When three million citizens vote on national votes and 66% vote to remain in the EU, "Millions feel dissatisfied."
Even though 99 percent of the authorities objected to the expulsion, they were very angry, "Why don't a thousand people write letters to the House of Commons?
There's no time for thousands of people to get out of the way.
One senior minister added that if two national votes were to cover the consequences of one of these, there would be a danger of "national violence" in this country.
Mr. Johnson wants us to make a choice, and he wants us to give the authority of the Bridget.
Mr. Johnson is reported to be facing opposition from the substation that calls for the EU's withdrawal and, instead, calls for cooperation with the EU.

Pakistan, the death penalty for a famous member of the Social Media.
A lot of time is spent up to the end of the sentence, and the killers who have been told among them are secure, and the memory of the case is low, says female rights experts.
"It's too late for people to forget," said Falzana, founder of the first gendarmerie department of Pakistan University, adding that even in the event of a baroque gathering, it was easier to resolve than three years ago.
It's hard to prove that reliability is a high level of data, but the human rights community says that the Pakistani Human Rights Commission has found at least 300 "smokers" in 20-8 years.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of known killers is much higher than that, because it assumes that about one fifth of Pakistan's 5,000-dollar homicides per year occur in the world.

The house is flooded with water, the inhabitants walk through the water, and the monsoon is usually the most popular view.
Other cities, including Kolkata, Raknau, and Hyderabad, have also suffered from severe flooding.
In the northern state of Uttararkand, there is much damage to the house in the rain.
It's too late for monson.
In many areas, water was scarce, and farmers were ready to be hit.
We don't like monsoons that grow long for farmers.
This is not the normal amount of rain at this time.
Prakash Mehera, a small-scale farmer in Bimtar, Utlarcand, said: "Now we're making coffee, beans, endow beans and tomatoes, but we're going to ruin the crops by rain."
And for consumers, it's going to increase the price of tobacco that doesn't get in India because of the late and weak effects of monsoon.
In cities such as Deley and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) are usually sold in 80 rupees.
The festival is also in danger.
The next big festival is in Dashela on October 8, when Hindus set up La Vana, a man of a great comic book-style character, who's coming out of the comic book song "Lamaryana".
To burn Lavana means to destroy what is good.
But because of the fact that it's a paper, if monsoon grows older, it might eventually be Lavana.

J'Begarta Square went to the 28-day Home Hall of M (7 p.m. in August) and continued non-open practice for 24 to 4 days (open to the first 20 minutes of the press).
In the area, M told me that in the nearby Rig War, "5 points are going to be lost, but the security officer (45) told me that "the players have been forced and trained by the Battalion."
Last night, at Home (July 8th), Klavwest's attempt to lose 8 points went down, and 5 points to the enemy.
It's a difficult enemy that's been hit by 2 this morning.
Now, three rounds of M for the four squares are going to cover 48 points of the Rig.

It's possible to raise the risk of developing heart disease and heart disease.
A recent study shows that there is a higher risk of heart disease than that of working around high-level agricultural drugs.
This is the result of a study of the American group in Hawaii living for over 30 years.
In comparison with a group of men who did not work around the farm, a large number of drug users were found to increase the risk of heart disease and heart failure by 45 percent.
"What is emphasized in this study is the importance of using personal protective equipment when exposed to the workplace, reporting on the presence of a drug in the workplace, and reducing the standard risk of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodrigues of the study.
Dr. Rodrigues is a professor of advanced medicine at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.
This was the result of a study of data collected from over 6,000 men living in Ofah, who participated in the Kaakini Honolulu heart program.
This study is limited to men in daily life, and it may not apply to women and others, says researchers.
Because of a long half-life reduction, the effects on health are likely to occur after years of exposure.
In this study, the biggest impact was seen within the next 0 years.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up study, there is no more important link between the appearance of the plant and the development of the heart and the heart," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably because there are other factors that are more important to the promotion, and it conceals the possible relationships between agriculture and cardiovascular diseases in the evening.
Researchers have found that there is no important link between exposure to low-medium drugs and heart disease and heart attack.
I'm going to call Zerenskutramp, and I'm going to get a proschenco.
The battle against President Donald Tranpmi was ongoing, and Washington's political issue was a very exciting week.
For politicians, Vorojimiel Zerensky, he wanted to avoid drinking in political scandals.
But what is it about the phone problem of Zelenskytranp so far, and what impact does Zelenski have on the scope of the phone?
First and foremost, Tranp tells Zerensky that the United States has a lot of goods in Ukraine than in other European countries.
The contact records published by the White House are not verbatim, and it is described in detail that Tranp criticised Tranp in more detail than the specific proposals of Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European heads of State.
The response of Zelensky, who said to oppose the tram instead of 100%, is the subject of the debate.
Zelenske added that President McCron and Michael do not have enough support for Ukraine.
The conversation was under attack, and politicians, particularly Ukraine's rural party, argued in social media.
President Pedro Poroshenko, former Ukrainian President, wrote on Twitter that "there is no precedent for EU support."
Furthermore, Poroshenko tweeted that he is grateful for the support of the EU's Russian sanctions and economic assistance in the "Russian aggression".
Ukraine's politicians, Victoria Vaitiska, say, "Can you communicate with Germany and France once more," and there are other politicians who show sympathy.
The result is more than military aid, and the result is a two-way investigation of Zerensky, the first of which is about the son of Joe Bieden, and the second of which shows that Ukraine was involved in the illegal invasion of the E-mail of the Democratic Party in 2016, and a survey of the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
It's not clear whether this is a barrier to Europe's relations, whether it's a barrier to France and Germany's backwater.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
Thanks to the people who support us, just as the communications record has been published, Zelensky said at the National Assembly in New York.
Zelensky is scheduled to meet with the head of France, Russia, Germany, at the Normandy 4 summit scheduled for October.
Garna, get two international civil aircraft.
At the 40th International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO), held in Canada Montreal, Ghana, there were two well-known participants.
This security measure has been granted to Ghana by 89.89 per cent on a temporary basis and it has been recognized that it has received the highest cost in Africa for aviation security supervisors.
Earlier, ICAO had completed ICVM on 3 April 2019 according to the World Security Watch report of the National Aviation Agency.
As a result, Garna was recognized as complying with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding the safety of airport and its airspace.
They were created around the country's long-standing zero-camping support of ICAO.
In addition, the security assessment of "6 approval books and security assessments" of "7 approval books were provided to the participating countries that have improved security standards.
The tribute was received by Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister Garna, Simon Aroti, Mayor of Garna Civil Aviation, Ambassador New Icoi Otwa Canadagarna, Yau Kwawawa Garnae Airport Company.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Council, Mr. Olmwi Benard, stressed the need to maintain the aviation security of the participating countries.
The co-chair said, "It is important to keep reminding ourselves that aviation security and security are still the most fundamental priorities in this innovation."
Mr. Adam also said that this time the award will complete the sector's weak and patient efforts, and that it is the gift of Garna's efforts.
His colleague also pointed out that, "Air has a lot of potential for changing our lives in a dramatic way," and that there is a large future for the aviation industry to develop the domestic economy.
There are social benefits, but all of them are for the safety and security that we have achieved.

It's a little bit of a way to get two shots out of a black war, and there's a certainty that it's going to get hit.
I'm going to pay attention to the response of the two teams that have a good shot.
The rulings and the three rulings were held in a meeting place on 29 days, and the three high schools were given the right to attend the North-East Congress, which opened in October.

Mr. Tramp, Peter Geyno has been appointed the highest officer of FEMA: White House.
Mr. Peter Geyno, President of the United States Emergency Management Board (FEMA), made a mockery of the 2020 FEMA request for an inquiry from the U.S. State Security Committee in Cape Town, Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
Washington (Reuters) - According to the White House statement, President Donald Tramp of the United States of America has appointed Peter Gino as the Federal Emergency Management Officer.
Mr. Geino, Vice-President of FEMA, was in the position of the President of the Government to monitor the disaster of Harriken and the volcano.
Since the resignation of the former President, Mr. Block Long, the former president has been in a state of disrepute in the upper room.
The FEMA State Security Department, which is the top organisation of the FEMA, has determined that Mr. Long was using public service cars in public employment between Washington and North Carolina, whose home is home.
Mr. Jeffrey Baird, another proposed person, was suspected of drinking alcohol and quarreling as a result of his own investigation, and was excluded from the election this morning.
Mr. Gayno's appointment was expected.
In the future, most of the offices will need recognition.
Before he was appointed Vice-President of FEMA in 2018, Geino was assigned to the Emergency Authority in Rhode Island, and was also a marine soldier, said White House.
CBSrosanzells, the police shut down the illegal Marifana Biping industry of San Gabriel Barley.
Elmonte (CBSLA) - The police shut down the illegal Malifana Beiping of San Gabriel Barre's tree.
The police started at 4:37 p.m., suspecting the illegal marijuana baby sales, and found a large container of Butanhany Oil (the cut-off oil) at the office in Telster, about 9600 blocks.
The Elmonte Police Department, Christopher Cano, said that the agent also found a device that was used to attack the baby-cards.
"This project is very dangerous," said the Cono Police Department.
The Kano Police Department has been conducting a drug investigation before, and the process of extracting oil used for beep products suggests that there is a possibility of fire.
"There's a possibility that only the light from the clothing will get out of the fire, and it'll cause explosions, not just fires," said the Kano Police Department.
In addition, if there were such multiple containers, not only the explosions and the fires, but also the possibility that the whole of the building would be bombed.
The risk management team was called to the empty office and arrested the materials that were illegally dangerous.
The price of the stolen goods and equipment was not immediately published.
An unknown information was received, and it was found in the search warrant at the scene, said the investigator.
Detectives are looking for the dark screen of illegal baby activities.
The police said that since the office was empty, the man himself thought he was setting up a store in the office.
In the course of the investigation, the police said that they wanted the latest news about the danger of biping, and that illegal biping products would not be released again.
The Cano Police Department said, "It's really real or it's a place where people buy things they don't know."
The product may also be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may be a major harm to our communities and our children, so the police are constantly warning people not to get close to this activity.
There are six major earthquakes in the midst of the concerts!
Preventive training at the Hall of the Wall Street (New York City) - Yahoo! News
I thought there was an earthquake in the middle of the concert, and there was a practice escape training in the city hall.
This training is launched every year.
In the stage, we actually think that there will be six powerful earthquakes in the way of music.
On 27 days of training, about 300 people, such as the small farm, the local population, and the staff of the hall.
“ I’m not sure what I’m doing is happening.
(Inhales in the hole)
"It's earthquakes, earthquakes, earthquakes, earthquakes.
And I thought there was a fire, and I thought it was going to happen, and the participants escaped to the Entrans.
I don't know when the earthquake will happen.
The participants changed their training and increased their awareness of disaster.
Elizabeth's missing clothes show up at the Hamptoncott Hall.
It was made up of the highest-level comerth syllabus, and it was covered with plants, flowers, and beautiful velvets.
Histrick Royal Palace's address audience, Mr. Ellie Lin, is a bit of a clue.
One of the ruins that Mr. Lin saw, which was on the wall of a small church in the Middle East, was placed there 100 years ago, and is seen as part of the clothing that was lost from the iconic dances of Elizabeth.
Since Mr. Lin found this lovely poem used as an altar of the church in Herefordshire, three years later, Elizabeth's missing dress is shown near the House of Hamptoncott next month, which is likely to have been used by the Queen of Chad more than 450 years ago.
"There's only one piece left in the sixth century, and it's known that it was important to find in the entire Royal Dress Collection.
There's no complete evidence that Elizabeth passed the ring on her dress, and the three years of study convinces experts that she has nothing to do with everything in the palace.
"Bu" that was soon used by the money industry was prepared only for upper-level members in the royal room, but it shows that the owner was a great man who had been brought up by the quality of the "name" plant and flowering plants and flowers. The dog, the dog, the bear, the goat, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the dog, the old owner were a great man.
It seems that when that dress was made, it was a price equal to a quarter of a square.
Moreover, in the late 1590s of Elizabeth, the queen was threatened by other women in the temple, and it was supposed that I would not be proud of the Levites who wore such beautiful clothes.
Mr. Lin, it's important to make a statement, and I've also been able to see a fellow expert.
And when everyone saw that building, they were convinced that they were always very proud of having seen one of the Royal Dresses.
The long seconds of a dress that was cut down and used as a sacrifice to the Holy Feis Church of Bactton is not as unexpected as expected.
Bacton is reported to have been involved in the long life of Queen Elizabeth's daughter in the village of Bransh Paris, where she served as a maid.
Dres is what Paris died in 1590, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, she must have moved into the family or church as a follow-up to Paris.
Over 1,000 hours of revision, of which 400 hours were spent on the very narrow handcuffs that were used for special use of silques and small surgery equipment, is intended to be shown on the front page of the "Shitfield House" of the most famous modern painting that was produced during the exhibition.
The only wide space that can acquire some of the most valuable topest trails is in the modified living room in the Hamptonkot land, where conservation works are done almost here, and Libby Thompson, who is leading the work, said that "it's a historic building, and it's a real respect for the worker's technique."
It's a very great respect for the person who made it.
I haven't seen any of this stuff that's been cleaned up yet.
Elizabeth's missing dress will be opened at the Hamptoncott Temple from October 12th.
For weeks, the team withdrew, and the men of the Bolantia were missing from the UTYTelevi Mountain.
It's been weeks since the first year's daughter's school was missing in the mountain village camp.
The self-defense team has not yet completed its search for 28 days.
In the week, 28 Sunday's search began with approximately 240 police and self-arms systems.
But the village was looking for an area that depended on it, and it ended in the afternoon.
The self-defense team had spent 650 days and four days in the centre of the mountains and the high-risk areas, but it was unable to reach it.
And on 27 days, the 20th-century man who was involved in the search in Bolantia didn't know how to find it, so he didn't find it.
Police and fire are a way to continue searching from 6:00 a.m. to 29 a.m.

The vote was not corrected because the election of the Senate was illegal this year, and the first oral debate on the ruling that the right-of-occupiers were seeking to invalidate the election was held in the Supreme Court of Justice, which was concluded on the very day.
According to the complainant, the number of members of the House of Commons in the election of July this year is the lowest in the country, and the value of one vote is equal to 0.71 votes, and the number of members of the House of Commons is 0.48 votes.

The Tokyo Motorcycle 2019, launched on 24 October to 4 November, will open the world's new model of the big truck 'Giga'.
This truck's flashing model, Giga, adds to the most advanced security device, and refills the fatigue reduction equipment to the driver.
The passenger and the driver will also be able to contribute to the safety of the safety of the bridge-spot monitors and flexible LED Headlamps, which will support the right-hand side of the crash and the change in the traffic.
Also, the driver's fatigue reduction is caused by all vehicle speeds followed by the vehicle forwards and the new hierarchical cables.
In addition, the "MIMAMORI" system of driving, operating, operating and operating vehicles is complementing both vehicles.
Security devices are also re-monitoring and supporting security operations.

Mexico's drug cartel department is involved in one third of the US's domestic drugs.
After the day of Chicago Westside, the CBS News caught the drug dealers.
Brian McNite, DEA, revealed what's going on in the White Houses.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of drug abuse.
McNith said the "probably 9 percent" of the drugs traded in Chicago was imported from Mexico.
DEA is generally referring to a Mexican drug king named El Mencho, called Nemesio Selvantes.
"Mencho is, in fact, the top-principal of the U.S. law enforcement agency."
The loan paid to El Mencho is worth $10 million.
With Donahu's help, ten drug manufacturing points in Milan were attacked.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harisco Nueva Kenerasion (CJNG) is related to at least three minutes of drugs imported into the United States on land and sea.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the co-Calter has secretly sold "a large amount of cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl mixture heroin.
El Mencho's head is paid $1 million.
In the flesh, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but he was arrested for his drug habit and sent back to Mexico.
That's where he started a violent drug cartel.
They have a large amount of weapons, portable rockets, 50 fingerprints.
Donahu said that he owns his own special unit.
El Mencho is protecting his empire without punishment from the six deaths of the Mexican military helicopter from the attack on public executions this summer.
In recent years, there have been thousands of deaths caused by drug cartels.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur on the first day.
In Chicago, Mexican drugs are to be used in protection when handling drugs in order to strengthen toxicity.
At the manufacturing point, the cocaine bag is under pressure from the seller's marks.
More than three minutes, it's called El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahu said, "Mencho is concerned with the inflow of material that actually captures the lives of innocent women and children."
I mean, when someone died, there's a "high chance" drug from El Mencho's organization, and Donahu said.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year from rape.

"Before February, 20 meetings on the island are scheduled for months, and we're going to see if we can continue as business for the next year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison indicated that the affected population had decided to provide additional $10,000.
The cash support policy for farmers who are affected by disasters is extended, and is very much focused on the simplification of existing farmers.
In addition, some $30 million is planned for the victim's support facility, which will make it possible for farmers to receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a program for helping affected areas to achieve a maximum of 13 self-governances, it is supported by a $1 million cut-off and rescue fund for each of the victims' infrastructures and combats.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already calculated more than $70 billion in cash and support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The wife's family is suspected of murder in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted of killing four of his five children in Spring, Texas, in 2014 by Mr. Stephen and Katie Stey.
Haskell entered Mr. Stey's house on 9 July 2014 and asked about the location of Mr. Meranie Haskel's wife.
Mr. Melanie was gone, but she had a sister, Katie Stey, and her family.
Haskell was fired, and Mr. Stephen Stey (39), Katie Stey (33), 13- and four-year-olds, 9- and 7-year-olds died, and the Harris Police Department announced.
In the family, only one man, who was 15-year-old Cassidy Stey, had lost his life.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then completely recovered.
Woody, all of the members of the jury rejected the plea of innocence because of the loss of the soul of Ronald Lee Haskell.
The jury was dismissed until the months of execution.
"If you choose to disappoint us, you will never let us."
A girl's complaint that angered the girl's anger has affected the leaders of the country in which she lives.
The temperature of the earth is getting deeper.
At a national air traffic summit in New York, six-year-old environmental activist Greta Tominberi of Sweden spoke out in favour of the strengthening of action.
As soon as I was a student boycotting and sitting in front of the parliament, I became a fire-fighting tool to spread the "School Street" in the world.
Young people who have been robbed of their lives have engaged in protests all over the world, including Japan.
"There are about 4 million people in over 50 countries.
I've walked through the message board, though, and I've been on my way.
The threat of climate change is approaching.
"Paris Agreement", which began in 2020, aims to reduce the global greenhouse gas emissions in the last half of the century and reduce the temperature twice before the industrial revolution."
In the developed countries, all participating countries are talking about each other's responses.
But there are different winds, such as high temperatures and rain, which are referred to as temperature.
In order to increase the temperature in the fast pace, a fraction of the process is required.
At a summit called by the U.S. President of the State to strengthen the crisis, the long-term goal of the 77 Canadian countries is to make a real zero for up to 50 years.
The other 70 countries are drawing up the target.
On the other hand, China and India have not revealed a new goal except that they have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and have become an integral part of the country's movement.
The criticisms of Japan that sustain the nuclear power generation are strong.
The government's long-term strategy only in the last half of the century can raise early output zeros, but it's a big difference between countries that watch the '50-year-old zero'.
I didn't even have a chance to speak to Japan at the summit.
In the context of environmental relations, the Japanese environmentalist who revealed Japan's trade unions said, "It's fun, cool, sexy."
I don't deny the appeal, but it's very weak than girls' complaints.
I'm not going to react to Mr. Greta, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
There's nothing more in the middle of the debate than "change the point of the argument."
There is no guarantee of warming, and the international community has to deal with the global crisis.
I don't want to have enough success in the negotiations of countries.
There's a lot of young people behind Mrs. Greta.
We're gonna have to move in so that we don't lose that future.
I've got a lot of internet going on again.
As a result of the U.S. Army's research, the mass Internet has actually been on its way.
In this way, the Internet may be able to provide military security, planning and time functions that were not possible in order to connect to the next network.
According to the Department of Field Research, the U.S. Department of Military Capacity Development, the National Institute for Military Capacity Development, researchers from the University of Insbruck have reached a record of mass transfer of matter and light - 50 kilometres of light-buddy cable.
It's related to the Entanglingment, which is made up of the quantified particles.
Two quantified bits are in the entangling state, and if the quantification is done on the side, but even if the quantified grams are in a far-reaching position, they will affect the results on the other side.
"This distance [50km] is the actual distance to start the construction of the city’s mass network more than in the past," says Dr. Ben Ranion, a leading project researcher at the University of Insbruck, who published the results of the survey.
The city’s urban mass network is based on a network of physical quantifiers that is located in the Entangling state, even if there is a large distance.
The division of this entangling element is absolutely indispensable to the creation of the quantified Internet.
"This evidence is a major step towards achieving a wide range of tanning elements," says Dr. Sarah Gamble, Deputy Director of the Land Programme, who supports the study.
Also, the entangling elements in the outputs that flowed through the wire are well enough to meet the number of conditions that are needed for some of the most difficult network usage.
The study team began experimenting with the calcium atoms caught in the intrap.
The researchers used laser light lines to write ion quantified status, while encouraging the release of quantified light.
As a result, the atom's quantity and light bulbs became an entangling state.
The subject is to send its light to the light bulb.
"The wave of light released from the Kalsimion is 854 nanometres and is absorbed immediately into the light fiber cable."
So in the doctor's team, I first sent that light bulb through a non-linear switch that fired a powerful laser.
The length of the light is the most appropriate distance to travel -- 1550 nanometres of the standard distance of the current communication.
And then I sent this light through a 50-mile light-cover cable.
As a result of the calculations, the atoms and the light bulbs kept the entangling condition even though they changed the length and moved the distance.
"Calsium atoms were used to capture the calcium as high-quality clocks," because this experiment will be achieved by a network that is very long-term, intertwined with the atomic clock.
The vast Entangling Time Network is a very important field of land use from the right location, navigation, and timing. "And Dr. Frederic Fatemi, another country researcher who co-operated with this program, said.
