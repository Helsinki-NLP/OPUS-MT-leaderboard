Hershey and Chase's experience is one of the evidence that DNA is a gene.
Hershey and Chase use the bodies, or viruses, to get their own DNA into the cells.
They've performed two tests to mark the DNA cells inside the body with a phosphorous compound or the protein of the body actually infected with the ovaries.
A gene can cause many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene activated and the cell affected is whether or not the cell is of the immune system.
