Wells' AM is concerned with 'mapet-like images'
Some members of the Council are concerned about the suggestion that the title of their term should be changed to MWP (Volsh's generation).
Because it's because it's designed to change the name of the Assembly and build Wells.
All the A.M.s connected with the government's debt are concerned that they can be exaggerated by this.
A Liberian AM said, "Don't join Twp and Pwp like this," his group was worried.
For the text that lives out of Wells: In Welsh, twp means empty and pwp means empty.
One Plad M said the whole group was "no fun" and he suggested other options.
A political group in Welsh said that his group was "free thinker", but he noticed that there could be a slight change in words to map MWP.
In this context, the elevation of W in Welsh is as accurate as that of U in Yorkshire English.
In a change in the name, the current Law-making Board of Directors said: "What the members of the Board are invited to say, the final decision of any interpreter in this regard will certainly be a matter for the members."
According to the Welsh government's 2017 census, the Welsh Council has the power to change its name.
In June, Iogo was told about the results of public advice, in which he had received much more support to build Welsh by changing the name of the Assembly.
With regard to the title of the AM term, Iogue supported Welsh resources or WMP, but found the most supportive MWP option in public advice.
Clearly, AM is offering many other options, but it is very difficult to obtain general agreement for the state authorities for Ellen Jones, hoping that they will present the legal fee for the change within a few weeks.
Other changes will be included in the legislation that is designed for changes, including the rules and the format of the committee system for amnocuousness.
When based on the law, AM will get the final vote on this question what they should be asked to say.
Macedonians are going to compete to change the country’s name
They will not be allowed to change their country's name on Sunday, "Republic of North Macedonia".
The Middle East has been called to resolve the ten-year-old dispute with Greece, also known as Macedonia.
Athens has already been stressing the fact that the name of her neighboring country tells of her country and she has several times spoken about her membership in the U.S. and Nato.
On a change of name, a Macedonian national statesman from Genmeth says they will ignore Maddan.
However, supporters of President Zoran Zoran Life and Matsangreh argue that change in name is the only reason to be involved in the U.S. and NATO.
St. Martin's hours are falling because of the decline in the churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said, "The stories I spoke to the ancients about how many times they used to go to church."
"Today, it's all over."
They said that it would be less than once.
They said, “The people of this day are in a different way.”
"They are no longer like the living room of the neighborhood where people go every day."
For the churches, they are concerned that the money that spends on the property will not go away for more than a few days, according to the hopes of the price leaders, "and they will soon end, or they will come to the exact place where they started."
They went on to say that the churches may have been transformed into apartments with the right to own, where people like the streets do not help to protect the safest places around them.
They said, "In these buildings, the love of those who have bought houses for the cause of truth will increase and the time will come when the churches will be completely closed, because it is not possible for most of them to become members of their churches.
A decade after St. Martin's death in 1870, the Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community of Harlem was formed by two church dignitaries of religious society.
The natives of the Methodist religious society went to the 1930s.
In these were found chief men of the common people, who worshipped the gods of the surrounding gods.
On St. Martin, the priest John Howard Johnson was under arrest by an undercover religious community that led to the removal of their own sellers on 125th Street, a place where Harlem was the main place for the sale, where they were opposed to the maintenance or promotion of the Assets.
The fire caused the building to collapse in 1939, but Father Johnson's followers began to play here for hours after it was redesigned.
Father Johnson's son and successor priest David Johnson said "Opening doors for the nearest people" to play a proud hour.
In July, an hour-old specialist told him, "It's a cultural heritage" and "a priceless historical institution".
The University of Michigan's special tiffney NJ also noted that this was the world's first hour played by the Assunticated Artist Dionysio A. Lind, who played a large hour in the Reverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriaver said they were not placed in St. Martin's place.
What happened in St. Martin in the past few months has become a story of leaders and leaders, some of whom have been appointed by the church’s general leaders and others in religious communities.
In July, the country was concerned that the region would "require to fill the gaps", whether or not the leaders and leaders appointed in the Western region were appointed.
Some of the local priests asked for a lack of clarity from the country.

Sansbury's plans to go to the U.S. boot market
Appointed experts with Sainsbury's boots are being assigned to the department store-style Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
Despite the fact that there has been an increase in demand in the amount of income and household goods, this is going to be included in the U.S. 2.8 billion-pound ticket market, which will be carried out in 11 stores throughout the country, and if this plan is successful the next year, more will be added to the market.
The entry made in the Butt is being made in the supermarket, whose purpose is to find out where he is in the market after bringing the contents of TV, microwaves and home.
Sainsbury's said that the first time it was produced by bringing to 3,000 products, the first time it was accompanied by brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more opportunities with branded products found in Boots' shop.
The supermarket is also re-starting its buttocking, so that most of the products are vegan-frandly - its demand in small and medium-sized businesses will grow slightly faster.
In addition, the perfume Retler Fragrance Shop will also examine special features in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in the past week in Crowden, South London, and the second in the end of this year will be open in Selie Ok, in Bramingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visas in low daily food prices in online shopping and local favorite stores.
The head of the Sainsbury's Chief Eggytiv, Mike Kup, said people like the department store on the island would come faster because Supermarket China is trying to get rid of Aldi and Lidl.
In the Sainsbury's hundreds of stores, Argo's outlet is being set up, and two years ago when these two chains were brought together, it also opened a number of stores, which shows that Kirana has been boosted by the amount of beer and the sale has been made more profitable.
Butt and farm products were failed in the previous attempt to re-export the product by Supermarket.
Sainsbury's had been trading with Boots at the beginning of the 2000 decade, but it had to end this trade because of the distribution of documents from drug companies in its supermarket.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the farm business to the owner of Lloyds Farms China in 125 million pounds, followed by a new procedure.
It says that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, together with La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix said, "We have changed the color of our boots, so that we can increase the flow for our customers.
We have also, in particular, joined trained colleagues who will help us to give advice.
We have built our bridge from the needs of every person and the attractiveness of the world, which means that we have reached the attractive destination of the waste products that choose the old way of trade."
Peter Jones announced 'Narazgi' when it was different from the 11 million pounds sales of Hilly Wilubi.
In order to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, when the TV president Bilubi decided to separate himself from the 11 million pounds sales for the life-style brand business of Dragons De's Star Peter Jones.
Biluby has no time for his homeviewer and accessories brand Truly.
They were compared to the carobars, which were made by the Brand Goop of Gwenth Potter.
This 37-year-old monitoring president declared himself different from Instagram.
Holly Biluby separated himself from his attractive Lifestyle Brand's carobar at last with Dragons Den's Star Peter Jones - so that he could focus on his new best contact with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The news shows that when Tv's Golden Gorler admitted during the heavy meeting at the Corobar of Johns in Bukkhamshire at the headquarters of Corobar, where he admitted that he was different from his new trade - which is costing 1.5 million pounds - he was angry about it, which means that Bilubi now doesn't have enough time to give their homeviewer and accessories brand Truly.
Carobar's comparison was based on the brand Goop of Gwenth Potter and was considered to increase by the estimated 11 million pounds by Wilubi.
37-year-old Wiluby announced on Instagram that he was different from Truly, after which Jones left Britain to go to his Hollywood home.
One group said: "Truly was always the top in Holly's priorities.
It was considered to have been his long-term future, which would have led to considerable progress in the next few decades.
And his judgment was given to every one of them, and to every one of them.
No one could believe what happened on Monday, it was very close to getting started.
The status of Godham in Marlo Hädquaarter is filled with materials known as Beckry."
Specialists believe that Britain's richest star could damage the shape by being different from this overlooking president, because it has invested much more in products such as clothes and humveries, and it may be too late to start.
Also, a long friend could end up with it.
For the past ten years, Jones and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been nearing the Cape Town of Bilub’s three children and their husband, Dan Baldwin.
Wiluby joined Cap and started Truly in 2016 and was joined by 52-year-old Johns Chierman in March.
Baldwin's TV produktion form includes 40 per cent of Johns's partners, who share their savings.
Biluby has now become the M&S brand ambassador and will be placed in an anti-Macpartlin place to host I'm A Celebrity's I'm TV.
One of Jones' neighbors said last night, "We don't want to talk about their business."
'And then we agreed'
They were hoping that the new media would be commenting on them, that some would consider it "a state-of-the-art work" and that North Korean leaders would become more active.
Why has the terrorist attack been so successful?
Tromp told his show at "New Anchor" Way.
"I didn't leave anyone."
He said that after his first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim was in the second meeting, a big step was taken to free North Korea from the first meeting.
However, freedom of speech was forbidden.
After more than three months of the three-month summit in Singapore, North Korea's head of state was Hong Kong, he told the world's leaders in the United States on Saturday that North Korea's beginning is not looking forward to the US's "sound response" response.
They said the U.S. continued to make pressure to keep the bans instead.
They saw a much more optimistic view of the trip’s railway speech.
They said, "We are starting to have a good relationship with North Korea."
"We were going to fight North Korea.
In which millions of people are killed.
Our relations are now better."
They said that their efforts to improve relationships with Kim had led to positive results -- including helping to complete the rocket test, help free ties, and return to their homes with survivors of the United States soldiers.
Also, they protected their inconsistencies in talking to Kim.
“It’s very easy to stay on the national agenda, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to get involved in this country, and we will have only 200 people to stop them.”
In Indonesia, an island of deafness and thirst has become an island, hundreds of people are dead.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need it.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national relief has been announced, and an international aid campaign has also been set up.
Mr. Sombhu said, "In some cases, unfortunately, they were clearly not asking for international assistance, so it became more difficult."
Nevertheless, the Minister of the Childran met with a team, but it has not yet been certain that workers from another country can come here to help.
According to N.A. Mr. Sutopo, the Indonesian authorities were pursuing the situation of Pula, they were seeing whether international agencies would be allowed to join in their efforts to help them.
In view of the situation in Indonesia several times, it seemed that the country was not prepared for the heat of production.

There is a lack of warning for the audience in Peru, no matter how devastating it may be, it is possible to increase the rate of life.
Although it is not the best time to travel, it is difficult to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
The ordering of commerce and property from natural estates is always slow.
The sufferers of earthquakes are being taken to a hospital in Lombok for treatment, which is far away from Pula and seems to have been at least three days to get here.
Nationalist Joko Vidodo has set up a very bad bunny roof in Indonesia for his election campaign and they have spent enough money to improve roads and rails.
However, Mr. Joko's government's lack of funding has become so much better because the next year will be re-elected.
M. Joko is also under pressure from the media in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim Majority have become more fundamental to religious thinking.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand were homeless, as Christians and Muslim groups were fighting each other on the streets using guns, rifles and arrows and other dangerous weapons.

The image of Ben Cromwell before the century has recently become the most famous monument, re-examined in history
Its departure will be exemplary for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artists, such as the Taliban, created by their corrupt Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society spoke of Mr. Crick's suggestion as "study" and "the attempt to re-writing history".
Chierman John Goldsmith of the Cromwell Society said: "The current database on the disposal of idols was full of confidence that the image of the Oliver Cromwell would be made outside of Westminster.
No command was given to mark the English Civil War and not to create Cromwell.
It may be wrong that Cromwell had abandoned his father Thomas's work in the past century.
According to Mr. William Hemo Trocrocroft, the best representation of Cromwell is a testimony to the history of the 19th century and of an image that many still believe is worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the United Telegraph: "A lot of people respect Cromwell, perhaps because of this, most people still know them as the defender of a standing generation against outside pressures in the late 19th century.
However, they are considered real representatives, which has become historically the subject of the debate.
It is clear that our nation is developing after the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell's image has become a personal identity that reflects the nature of a part of the division.
As Lord Projector, they are worthy of praise and memory."

A group of supporters of the Nakabupos refugees were alarmed by the police and the police, who had been beaten by the street.
The police used their fingers to get a grip on the wound, and then they grabbed their hands.
Freedom-supported groups have been calling for "no memory, no forgiveness" for hours, while joint representatives have condemned "span dying".
According to local press reports, four people who were injured by the display were treated.
According to Madrid, the most popular gathering of the Garcanonists is raising anxiety in free-of-occupancy areas for a year from 1 October, but the dissidents in Catalonia were ignoring it.
Votors have chosen very good ways for freedom, although few people have opposed the country's massive opposition.
The authorities of Catalonia reported that some 1,000 people were killed during the last year when police were trying to stop people from moving to the middle of the country.
On Friday night, groups supporting freedom stood there to help the National Police stop the show.
The presentation was further promoted, but it had to be forced to make a different decision.
In 68 C.E., Elektrisian Narciss Termins and his wife had come to participate in the anti-communication show, they said they were unlikely to be free of Catalonia.
"We've had the best year of our life.
I've seen my parents smile and rejoice, but it looks like we're stuck now."
In spite of a small victory in the last December regional elections, the liberal groups of Catalonia have fought to keep up this year with their many glorious leaders, even if they are to defend themselves or to wait for their role for the eternal proclamation of freedom, organized by Matsangrah.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Poig, who recorded the opposition on his phone to help the police, said that the conflict between the two birds had been halted.
He said: "This is most surely of the ill-fated."
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, one of nine leaders from pre-Trell Prison, announced that they would fight in the European elections next year.

Megan won Livingstone against Rangers from 1 to 0
Prior to Dolly Inga, Google confirmed Livingstone's victory
Livingston, who is moving faster, according to the manager of the Ibrox Club, gave the Rangers four, with Stephen Gerard only taking over his second job on 18 May.
Dolly Begg's strike created an interval that compared the side of Gary Holt's site with the Hebrews in the other part of Mach.
Gerard's side has been a step away from victory in the Prime Minister's victory and will meet the leaders' Hearts next Sunday, followed by eight points.
Earlier, in the European League of Guruvar, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna.
In the middle of the last month, Keny Miller's position is constantly winning in the division of Livingstone six games.
Livingston failed to display his game
The Holt team should have gone on long before scoring, and, because of their good game, Rangers had many problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but he was following the goal of digging, and then Ellen Lithgo was able to only be a directory trying to complete the goal in the head of Craig Halkat.
Guests were given the opportunity to play against Rangers, knowing they could put the viewer in trouble on set ps.
And that's the way he got a big deal.
Rangers found a free-kick, and Livingston worked to set up an open, Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who took a stick and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, Rangers had strengthened his position, but he was wrong in the home defense and left a lot of limits on the golf course,
This was also going on in the pattern second Haf, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on serving.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Ellen McGreger at Rangers' golf course, and Lithigo flicked the game from other Livingston.
Crossing the Livingston Box is ongoing and continues to go round, while two pints were placed after the Halkat Challeng, one of which involved taking Glen Medalton and the other handball.
Analysis of Livingstone's 'inconsistencies'
Alasdie Lamtont, in Scotland, was included in Tony McCoroni Arena
Livingstone's inconsistencies and results.
For anyone, they were better, they've continued to raise expectations in this growing tragedy.
The way they play and the personality has been miraculously replaced by the top pilot after their return, but most of them go the way they have given the team a new line after their arrival.
There were many better players.
Captain Hulkat was a better player, and they served in a wonderful way, while in the city, Connor Goldson and Wall were behind them.
However, it was not possible to learn in Rangers.
The kind of good show they've done many times under Jérard, they've been less than their standard.
Their final ball was low -- they only once were able to cut their home side open -- and it was like a few eyes-up call for Rangers, who put themselves in the mid-table.

As a result of the storm of Russia, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City is a high - risk threat.
After withdrawing from Arizona of Russia, there has been a dangerous situation in the tropical areas, but the full possibility of this is that in the coming week, it can affect the safe ability of the air to maintain the Southwest, which has made it increasingly difficult to get back.
On Monday and Monday, National Weather Service announced that there is a fast rise in the cities of Phoenix, Flagsuff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, in southern Arizona, and in the east, southeastern California, and in Yuta.
It is expected that on Friday evening, the Russians will be directly out of Phoenix.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "It's only since 1950, that 10 supernovas in the 200 miles [200 km] of Fenix have maintained the weather or weather conditions!
Caterina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Sea of Azed. "
In recent years, the National Ukrainian Central Model has estimated that it can be divided into between 2 and 4 inches in the Mogolon Rome of Arizona, and it is also expected to be 6 inches in it.
With Central Rockies and Great Basin, it is possible to have a range of between 1 and 2 in the other parts of Southwest, and it is also expected to be 4 in the same way.
The richness of Rosa can be seen outside the tropical areas, because it is known in this area.
Although the barrier has become a subject of very serious concern, it has now become a state of drought in Southwest, which is more likely to benefit from the drought.
According to the U.S. Drout Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's territory is very well known, this is the second highest category," reported a report of such weather.com.
First of all, the Gulf of California will be replaced by the river Rosa Mexico.
It was 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, at which time it was 385 miles south of Ukraine, Mexico, and now it is increasing from 12 miles per hour to north.
The wind is now in the cool waters of the Pacific, which is causing its energy to drop.
Thus, it is hoped that nuclear power can cause pollution in Mexico twice a day or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, there is a risk of a severe drought that could increase the risk of getting worse.
According to the "weather.com" report, "It is expected that the coast can be divided from California to the North-West Sun between 3 and 6 inches, as well as 10 inches of it."
After that, the Russians will become a tropical storm in the morning of Monday, before reaching the Arizona border on the north side of the river, after which it will reach the southern direction of Arizona and South Yuta on the night of the weekend.
The National Ukrainian Center said, "The most dangerous side of California, the North-West Sunora, and the U.S. Dieter Southwest are the most dangerous parts of Russia or the rest of it."
It is estimated that because of these crops, there is a high risk of growing up and growing up in the mountains of Mali, and that there may be drought in the mountainous areas.

Within a few minutes, much water came out, and the buildings and the cars were taken away with them.
The driver was not able to detect the Futage immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused the crisis in Pula, and the traffic lines were broken, which made it difficult for the authorities to join the rescue efforts.

But it's not done yet.
"It's still on the ground level,” said Olya Aryani, founder of Red Cross, who is in Indonesia.
"After being told by the government, it is a national tragedy, and we can include international aid workers in the protection work, but it has not yet been."
And it came to pass on the morrow, that after the earthquake and the second night of the earthquake, and after the earthquake, and after the earthquake, and after the earthquake of the second night, men and women, who had not known the companions of the house which were with them, looked forward to the miracle which their beloved loved ones had seen, as they also had seen.

At the beginning of this year speaking to Radio Host Big Boy on his album's title, West said, "I believe the word 'yes' has been used several times in the Bible, and according to the Bible, it means 'up'."
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.

In the 50 years of the country's protest against students, Mexican national statesman Andres Manuel Lopez Obredor has never used this oath for innocent citizens.
On Saturday at Teltelko Square, Lopez Obrador promised that "the military force will never be used to force Mexicans."

The U.S. needs to double the value of the id for
Google, Microsoft and Apple's less-floating investor and AI's businessman K-Fly said, since China is becoming more active in intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the cost of research in this area.
After much of the U.S. government's work, the AI commented, they also said that the U.S. Assembly is less operational than the U.S.
In the meantime, last year China launched a plan: its goal is to reach number 1 in the IE investment by 2030.
Lee said, "It's a good start to double the search budget, look at all other countries, and the U.S. is behind this, and we're trying to make the IA's next success."
In a witness this week, Lee from CENBIC said, "The possibility of double-crossing the fund could double the possibility that the next major assets of the AI would be in the U.S.."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hutton Mifflin Harcort, is a series of filmmakers, one of the best companies in China's AI companies.
In the 1980s, they had worked on an AI system at the Carnegie Mailen University, which left the most vulnerable American Othello player behind, and later they were appointed as president of the Chinese branch of Google at the time of the Agguitiv in Microsoft Research.
Lee better described the technical capabilities of the former U.S. Guvernundt, which included the robotic challenges of the Defense Advansd Research Projects Agency and said that it would be the next government that would recognize the future stranger.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often have to face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
Lee said, "This isn't China to eliminate academic leaders, it's corporate."
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technical companies have appointed diggs from the university to work on the AI.
Lee said he can help the U.S. in his IA efforts by changing the immigration police.
They said, "My account should be given permission to PACHD in the AI by the Green Card."
In July 2017, the state Council of China continued its NEXT-general Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
Lee said, "The National National Science Foundation of China is providing financial assistance to researchers of the U.S. National Sciences Foundation as well as to academic institutes, but the quality of teaching in China is not very good.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defense Department opened a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve participants in the promotion and education, and White House announced the construction of a Selekt Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DPRK launched a first on behalf of the AI NEXT, in which two billion dollars were invested.
For NSF, it's now more than $100 million per year in the AI survey.
In the meantime, the U.S. law was made that the requirement to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians have vowed to change the country's name
On Sunday the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, it is a work that will resolve the old dialogue with Greece, which has prevented Greece from joining the European Union and NATO.
There is also a country in Greece whose name is Macedonia, which says that the name of its northern neighbor is on its territory, where two names for the same debtor are already included in the NATO and the European Union.
On the basis of the proposed new name, the two governments split in June, but ethnic opposers opposed it and said that the national identity of many people living in Slovakia would be weakened by the change in the name of Macedonia.
Nationalist George Ivanov said that they would not be cast off in a public assembly and they suspected that the polling would be at least 50 per cent valid.
On the Voting Ballet this question will be written: "Do you approve of the negotiations with Greece for NATO and EU membership?"
Supporters for the replacement of the name Zoran Life of President Zoran say that it is necessary for Macedonia to become a member of such countries as Eu and Nato, which is one of the countries in which the letter of Yugoslavia stands.
Olivera Georgeevska, 79, who lives in Skopje, said, "I am here today to celebrate the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, so they will be able to live freely in the U.S. map because it means we have a secure life for all of us."
Although it is not legally enforced, most members of the community say they will act according to the polls to make it a decision.
A two-thirds of credit is required for the name change in the set.
The State Elevation Commission says there were no reports of irregularities until the next 1 game.
Although only 16 per cent of the vote was made in 2016 when the previous constitution was elected, 66 per cent of the candidates voted.
A 62-year-old politician living in Skopje said, "I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe."
President Zoran Zev of Macedonia has been elected to change the name of his wife, Zorika and his son Dosuko in Macedonia, to join the country's NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Stromeca, Macedonia.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Coverdarkov, who lives in Skopje, was preparing small-scale courses, and were taking courses against those who opposed this polling.
Quaddarkov said, "We need to join Nato and Eu, but we want to raise our heads, not through any agreement."
"Our country must be poor, but we also have our own dignity.
If they don't want us to join Macedonia, there's nothing to do, we can join China and Russia, like other countries, and be part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zev said Macedonia will have a very important contribution to membership in NATO, with more than 20 per cent of its health.
After his vote, Zev said, "I think it's going to be more positive because more than 80 percent of us are willing to connect with the U.S. and Nato."
They said, "Yes," as a result, "the certainty of our future."
Last Saturday, everyone published by the Institute for Police Research in Macedonia learned that 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in this polling.
The rest of Macedonia's telema TV has found that 57 percent of the people are planning to vote.
Of these, 70 percent agree to contribute here.
More than 50 percent is needed to succeed.
If the polling failed, the Western Governor's rights in May will be seriously challenged first.

Tromp went on to say, "You can look at this most terrible group of broken pieces of democracy, you can see all the things that's going on now.

It is not for those who say what is in their hearts that it is not for them to be blamed.
It was a great surprise for me when the members of my local party hired me to vote for my election.
Finally, I'm the newest among the few hundred generations whose importance is too low - we can't say all the words of our heart.
This was also with my cousin John Ryan because he had also raised a voice for non-ethnicity.
In my case, the Senator Mosun accused me of inconsistencies with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of the economic police, on national security, there were problems similar to the U.N.T. Mac Towers in Europe, which were inconceivable to the leaders of the Jeremy Empire.
"We want all things to be included in the meeting and these will be useful."
In my eight years as a local Liberian MP, I have seen more than anything like Friede Nitt Gyming in the same way.
Unfortunately, many of today's meetings are not in agreement and it is promised that the government of the "Dajal and the Poor" is actually forgotten, even here.
It is obvious that if the view is different in the Liberian party, they will not be offended and it is decided for every opinion whether the party is eligible for leadership or not.
Shortly after Jeremy's leadership began, which I had previously thought to my colleagues that they had a political attitude like mine, they hoped that I would return from my words and work on things that I would never agree with - whether it was national security or then the single EU market.
When I raise my voice to the public -- and I really don't know what I'm going to say -- I find bad words on the social media, it's a lot of emphasis on it, the central government is being criticized and I'm told that I'm not worthy of a Liberian party.
Besides, it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know that I am more likely to be compared to some of my colleagues because my comments are linked to politics.
I know how to work with the workers and dedicated to those who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don't give up voice.
In today's political era there are many disappointing approaches, one of which is how to create normal levels of abuse.
The last week, Jeremy Corbin claimed that it was necessary to promote the culture of non-employment for the Liberian party.
In fact, we are no longer the bread church and the changes in every proposal or party's silage have become very small.
Many people have given me advice in the past two years and asked me to do this. I'll be quiet, don't talk too much, and then I'll say, "I'll be right."
But I didn't come to politics for it.
32 years ago, when I was in high school, I was encouraged to oppose the theatre government, I was told that I would completely abandon the scope of my school, that I asked people to give the best public services they needed most — whether it was local president or then the government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, along with the politics that has been elected in the past.
There is no one in the Notignom East who has no doubt about my terms and my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who have promoted the offer on Saturday that as the country's homes, businesses and our public services are growing to a broken state, I do not need to waste my time and energy in expressing my loyalty to the Liberian party.
But, actually, I have a message that is not for the Noting Momentum, it's for my supporters, whether they're in the library or not: I'm proud of the fact that I'm serving you and I promise that I can't produce any special shock or political agency in my work, I'm just interested in what you're all right.

Ir 38 - 17 Melrose: Reaching the Irrefuded Head of the Irrefuge
The two recent efforts can have a certain effect on the final results, but there is no doubt that the best entertainment champions of the Irish Tenant were entitled to win.
Now they're only on the top table of the ten condemned sites.
Finally, their defenses were better, they found the best they could get, so they promoted the home team and gave Peter Marke the chance to be happy.
They said, "We have done our exams, and we are still sinners, so it makes me happy."
Robin Cristy of Melrose said: "Isca's lord is going to Ira, who lost his opportunity as far as possible."
The 14-minute effort of Grant Anderson must have brought Frazier Climó before Iir, but the game won by Variers was awarded to the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who had the opportunity to make a score on Melros, and Jason Baggen lost the most difficult attempt.
With the help of the Haf-time, with the help of the right Penalti, climate increased, they rolled up, and then tried to unify the 17-5 mass for the ice during the break.
But Melrose was better in seconds and the effort of Patrick Anderson changed into the Golgoll, with five points less than Levi.
After that, Rurideh Nott became seriously injured, which led to a long stop of the game, which led to their removal, and after the game began, Ira continued to try through Stafford McDowell, whom Climus replaced in the Goll.
At the time, the Irish team's captain Blair McFerson had received a card, and after that much pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an attempt to extra man Bruce Colwin who was unable to miss him.
Although the Maghreb team was behind and when Stroon Huchinson was hit by a hit by a ball from the Penalti Line-Out climate, McFerson took a step further down the line.
After sending flanger Gregor Henry away for the fifth effort of the home page of David Armstrong's boxing by Xe Rowe, Climo replaced it in the throat, as they could do when the game started again.
The game's star is still searching for a new player in the restaurant
The game's Star Ford Kiran is still looking for a way to go to the Hospitalitt Industry, some time ago it was known that they were selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old Jack is connected to Jarvis Mishaur Bambis Shoo, in which they work writing and contribute much earlier to the action of the Commodity Partner Greg Hempfield.
They said that the next new Cyrus Sho will be their last seriously in the world, and it looks like they're planning what Kiern should do after Cregeling.
On the basis of the official record list, they're the directory of the adriffmon Limited.
Acter refused to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source warned that he wanted to join a "good restaurant trade" in Kiern Glasgo.
'We have power over the sea': Earth-based Bolivia hopes that the Court will reopen the way for peace
Army-Navik La Paz's new capital is hiding on the main floor.
The Osijin-Blue flag is being launched on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazan, it's one of the rivers: "We have power over the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the 19th century, Chile's country is still in a desperate state to find its own land - once again they want to take their land to the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope that the ten will be able to get their Bolivian land back in the first ten years, because it is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1st.
Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calazila said, "There's enough zeal in Bolivia now, there's a sense of unity and peace here, and there's a positive result, according to the hopes of the people here."
Many Bolivians will see the great decision of the ICJs on a large screen across the country, hoping that the decision of the Hague court will be on the side of the Bolivian side - which has been discussed for decades - to force Chile to return to the country of Bolivia through dialogue.
Bolivia's greatest nationalist, Ivo Morales, who are facing the wedding opposition in the coming years, has also been active in the voting of Friday.
Last August, they said, "We're very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in the favor of Bolivia - and even if the decision is in the interests of it, there will be plenty of regrets.
In the Netherlands, the U.N. has no authority to celebrate Chile, and he has determined that the possible results of the news will not be determined.
At the International Court of Justice, Chile's Special Pais Zrett said the decision of the ICJ was coming six months after the final announcement that the case was "not closed".
In addition, unlike Bolivia's borders, it seems four years ago that it can come back to the old situation.
Jaret said, "The time of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia."
They suggested that the Morales' wedding feast had ended the rest of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk about some jokes, but this time it will be very difficult to talk.
Since 1962 both countries have not been in each other's country.
Former Prime Minister Eduardo Rodrage Wells, representing Bolivia, in Hegh, denied that the court's decision was inconceivable.
They said on Monday there will be "a chance of a better chance to open the way for new relations with Chile" and this will be a chance to "stop differences of 139 years on mutual benefit".
Calazila pointed out that Morales - still one of the most famous presidents of Latin America - was ruling on the sea issue.
They said, "Bolivia will never give up its authority to reach the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is to go to what we needed to do in the past."
The Koreans said that the Lord's Watch would not be stopped until he was trusted in the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister Reyong said that his country won't be destroyed until he doesn't trust Washington.
Rey gave a speech on Saturday in the General of the United Nations.
They told the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of other countries.
They commented that the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio seems to be going to start again more than three months after the promises made in North Korea's UN Secretary-General.
Rey said it's a "Pype Drem" that will be regarded as a violation of the U.S. situation for the declaration of the end of the Korean war.
It is a warning against the consent of a major rape agency that has already taken place without the announcement of Washington Pongang.
Kim and the U.S. Secretary of State Donald Trump both want another summit.
However, it is entirely unlikely that Pyongyang's gods are serious enough to stop monitoring the bomb because they do not want the security of the country to be compromised.
Kim-Trop is planning to go to Pompeo Pyongang next month to prepare for the next major convention.
Displays a number of new design leaders for your neighbor's Hae Street in Paris.
If you have to increase your heat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, you don't have to wait anymore.
Valentino and Tom Brown both designers have created a collection of better headviews for their SS19 collection on Ranwe, which appeared in the famous Paris face-to-face box of the special style.
The Best Benefiting Hats are designed to avoid this year's heat, and these designers have sent their beautiful Creature to show up.
The best hats built by Valentino were large enough, such as those with the wide brum that had fallen on the head of the model.
Most of the site has a lot of access to the other accessory, including the Waterleman Hott, Vizard Hott and Pinepple Design Hotts - but they are not designed to protect your head from noise.
Tom Brown also showed designer faces - and their use can only be made in time for Halloween.
Seeing many colorful faces, people were surprised and more than Hautat Koucher saw things like Henible Lecter.
There were all kinds of objects for Scooby daving in one Creation, including the Snowball and the Sun, while the Iscrem Con design, which was embedded in the other Creation, was seen.
Besides, if you've seen more sentences - you're getting closer.
The style viewers estimate that this better collection can soon reach the best businesses around you.
A very large-scale hothead will meet with La Bomba's design hall, with two-foot wide-browded Bram Strometh Rahana and all the people will be able to buy to Emily Rajajeksky.
The art label behind the best interactive hat, which seemed to be quite popular, was shown with the second Crescent Katwock posted on the social media - showing the streaming set on the street between the bugs.
Burnt Orange's Bug Rafia Springing and White Leather's Handheld, was the best influence of the River SS19 collection at James Wick.
The famous celibrity Luke Armitez said to Efamail: 'I hope that the coming summer will soon come in big hots and mid-bag shops -- because designers have been so influenced by this that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessory.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for foreigners
The private school of Scotland looks at the track record of higher education, and it has continued to give better results since 2018, which has strengthened the personal and collective success of the game, art, music and other community efforts.
Over 30,000 students from the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) throughout Scotland are trying to serve their students and relatives best in their leadership.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their selected teachers and their places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
We see that today's language in schools is being chosen as a choice of the most honorable and desirable subject.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you will be better for him.
And if you speak to him in his language, his heart is blessed.
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we feel that we can trust English more.
In recent years, we can see the results of these years that are the highest in private schools with the highest level of language in the League table.
68 percent of them are students who have received the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by 74 ESCS schools shows that 72 percent of students received the highest grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish.
It is known that private schools in Scotland are assisting in foreign languages where children and young people are being given the necessary skills that they will need in the future.
Languages are now included in private school texts and other subjects such as STIM subjects (science, science, engineering and mathematics).
The U.K. Commission for Implementation and Skills in 2014 found that officials fought enough to appoint workers on empty terms, with 17% less language skills.
Therefore, young people are not prepared for their future careers.
Because of the most likely everyday times of language-needed people, these skills are needed to work anywhere in the world.
Why not choose any options for the Koreans, if people have learned another language, they will be able to benefit from this kind of experience in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreigners, you will be responsible for being a multilingual person.
In 2013, more than 4,000 people in Britain participated in YouGov, according to which 75 percent could not speak enough in a foreign language, and only French was the subject of 15 percent speaking, and it was the only language that was reached by two-digit percentages.
That is why children today need to be involved in learning the language.
In many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, children can actually get a better chance of finding the right diet.
There will be different languages to teach in every school in Scotland.
Many schools also focus on the more classical Modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are the focus of 2020 and that are the most important for the U.S., for example, Mandarin or Japan.
Even if your child’s interest is not in learning any language, they will always choose that language in private schools, and they will also be able to get specialized courses in this field.
The private school of Scotland is dedicated to providing education that will prepare children for the future and give them the necessary skills to make progress in the future.
For the global business environment, it can no longer be recognized that learning languages is very important for the future of the country, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should be accepted as "International Communication Skills".
This option will continue to be given to young people in Scotland through private schools to choose the option, diversity and excellence.
You need to do it.

However, the Republic needs to help the Republic to face the major challenges of this difficult place in November.
According to Reuters, this is how President Tromp told during the campaign, "The goal of these five-week rounds is to fill in self-sustainment and supporters as a democratic effort to protect and increase their wealth in the future."
According to Reuters, the user who was removed from the assembly, he said, "The control of Congress has been so necessary for their agents that the presidents will only take over the countries where our agency is very busy.
According to West Virginia Metro News, "Wiling's Wesbank in Erina can be taken to the Pittsburgh media by the supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania tonight."
It will be the second time in September, when the storm hit West Virginia, they received more than 40 percent of the land in 2016.

Reuters Cup 2018: Team US has shown a willingness to fight in order to keep the hopes of living on top of Sande Singles
After three rounds of sessions, on Saturday, the fourth session will result in what is going to happen in this driver's cup.
The length of time, in milliseconds, to delay between each player in a burst sequence of players.
So, what would they now say about this moment?
As the day progressed, Jordan Smith said, "They had an increase of six points that now remained, so I think we'll have to increase our speed a little bit."
Of course, Europe benefited and took 12 points in the game and went forward four points.
According to Spyeth, Americans think they have a bit of opportunities and much to encourage, not only from Spieth's form but also Justin Thomas's form, who played with each other all day and they got three points from their game.
Spythet T and Green are the killers and the best in the game.
As they grew up in their game, people were excitedly playing violent dances, when they and Thomas went down after two and a point, they played an important role in completing four Al-Squairs.
It's because of their shoes that their team came to 15th edition with the same screen, which tells you that you don't like the American team.
Said he, 'You have only to play well, and be careful that victory is yours.'
So they say all players are out of the game.
18 hools to create a brand.
In the last two days, more than Spit and Thomas have only two players called Francisco Molinary and Tommy Fletwood, who are making new history in the radar.
Europe's different styles, but the best hats have received four points and are ahead.
On Saturday, the only couple who didn't shoot a bogey, but they left the bozo before Saturday morning, Saturday and Saturday morning.
The way he found the race and the race on Sunday was found in this strong crowd and from this strong crowd like they were dividing players, and no player could change the potential win of the European team, thinking that the Gulf of Nessula would be the first to be compared to the Fleetwood or Molineri.
It's good to be in two different ways.
However, Europe's poverty is getting pretty early.
Bobba Larson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Forball's Hiro-Serjio Garcia in the morning, when their partner Alex Noren was built.
There was a box in front of nine dogs, and Spain and Sweden burned in two barrels, they had never been here before.
However, on Sunday there was no one who could help you to reach your hall.
The forums and forums were much better to see because there was a lot better interaction between Beijing, they suggested that they should not be consulted and that they are well-known to change virtues.
Europe as a team has played a very good game and has increased significantly in the last day, but this forum has also shown that the team has the ability to cope with the U.S. which is particularly suspicious in the state.
The last day of the driver's coat Europe increased from 10 to 6
After the 10-6th and the last day of the driver's coat of arms, more than 10-6th and 6th in the United States, Europe will benefit in a good way.
The best couple, Tommy Fletwood and Francesco Molinary, have increased to the Tiger Woods fighting with two winners so that they can make a great deal of progress on the four points of the Golf National.
Two years ago in Hezlatin, Thomas Bjorn's European side, to pay for his injuries, was arrested because of the U.S. side embezzlement in Forball, where he received more than 3-1 in Syria.
The U.S. showed more opposition in the two-major forum, but they could not escape defeat.
To keep the triumph of Trophy, Jim Furrick's side needs eight points in the 12 single match on Sunday.
Flitwood is the first four-point European opponents to win, whereas he and Molineri started with Molywood after the centenary weekend, they are the second couple who win their first four-point in the history of the Rider Cup.
After losing Woods and Patrick Rid in Forball, they stopped at five and four points more good to catch the better players Woods and the American Roky Bison Deshambu.
Voods, who kept up with two games on Saturday, showed their best performance, but now they've faced 19 times in their 29th and 7th games of Foreball and Forsam.
Justin Rose returned to the rest of the Morning Forball with his partner Engineering Station and destroyed one of the world's three players, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cupcakes from 2-1.
Although, in the South West of Paris, the Pilzent had no break with Europe on the Brazilian day.
On Saturday, three-time winning leading players Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas won two points and set up a benchmark for the United States.
They won a 2-1 great victory on John Herme and Ian Potter in Forball and sent Pauls and Rory Michael back to the first two halls of 4-3.
The history of the Rider Cup has only doubled when a team got four points and returned from the match that arrived to Single, although the necessary site of the Furrik was affected by the traffic.
Although, two days after being a second-best, the counter-attack is going to be as different from their old game.
The Koreans said, "There's no way out of this." Disappointment will only be a bird that cannot be trusted.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said that on Saturday the United Nations has continued to oppose those who relied on their lack of faith in the United States and has not shown any way by which the country will stop monitoring the bomb only by itself in such situations.
Reyongho said in the New Secretary-General of the World Body that last year North Korea had many ways of dealing with "the important way of feeling" such as to stop the testing of the Lord's Bomb and Missile, to expose the testing place of the Lord's Bomb, and not to promise to continue the work of the Lord's Arms and the Lord's Spirituals.
They said, "We have no answer from the United States for this."
"There will be no confidence in our national security without trusting the U.S. in any way, and there will be no way in which we will start neglecting one another."
While Rei repeated that the questions raised by North Korea are about the "active" view of Washington, which will gradually benefit North Korea in an orderly manner, it is clear from their statement that this single abortion cannot be abandoned by just one step because Pyongang has already done so.
For the first time, on June 12 in Singapore, the U.S. President-in-Office of North Korea, re-enacted a joint statement by Kim Jong and Donald Tromp, while Kim agreed to work in the direction of the "Coryan Use of Violence", while the Tromp took the floor for North Korea's security.
The Korean war in North Korea in 1950-53 is calling for a dramatic end, but the United States says that Pyongyang should stop his own weapons first.
Washington has also opposed the call to end severe international barriers in North Korea.
Rey said, "The U.S. has put emphasis on the first rape and has increased the pressure of obstacles so that he can fully achieve his goal, and also, he has given attention to the "declaration of the end of the war."
"The obstacle can strike us, the idea is a pipe drama for those who ignore us.
But our trust continues to be weakened by constant opposition."
Rey didn't discuss the plan of the second lecturer assembly between Kim and Tromp, they said the U.S. leader had spoken of the U.S. leaders of the United Nations last week.
Instead, Prime Minister Kim and South Korean leader Mun-Jin discussed three meetings in the last five months, and went on to say, "If there is a South Korea party for this problem and not the U.S., the Korean climate will not be involved in such a crisis."
However, Rei's speech was very different from last year's speech when he said about the U.N. National Wembilley that the Soviet mission called "Rocket Man" after the "M. Eville President" trip to North Korea with the U.S. Menland Rocket.
In the United Nations news this year, the threat of "complete destruction" of North Korea in North Korea has praised the power of Kim to be raised for rape but said that there is still much work to be done and the restrictions will continue until North Korea does not.
On Wednesday, the Trop told them that they had no time limit for it, "If two years, three or five years go into this, there will be no difference."
China and Russia insist that Pyongang should be nominated for steps to bring up the U.N. Security Council.
However, the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompio of the State said to the U.N. Security Council: "We must remain in force against the Security Council until we realize without any failure that we are completely, final and verifiable."
In 2006, the Sikuriti Council banned North Korea with full agreement to fund the well-being of Pyongyang and the Bolistic Missile Program.
In the U.N. General Ambeli, Pompeo met with the government and then told them that they would be reenacted for the next month for the second circuit assembly.
Pompeo has already been in North Korea three times this year, but it has not improved in the past.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said that the work was on, and in just a few hours, North Korea complained about "Gangster-like demands".
This month, North Korea has planned to destroy the Missile Site in the month of May, and if the United States takes "a musical instrument", it will also destroy the planetary environment.
They said Kim had promised them a "song" approach, they were asking for a security guard to design a tram in Singapore and to move on to create a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard's students are running for a job that's good enough.
The Harvard University has launched a new course this year, which is for all the engrages that want more and more rest in the field of education for the caffeine-intensive "Al-Niters" students.
The number of the world's students at a university usually has no choice when simple things come up to give themselves a sense of what to do.
Professor Charles Caesar of Slip Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dr. Briggam and Vince Hospital have made a course that they consider to be the first course in the U.S.
After talking about the effects of less sleep during the course, they decided to start this course.
They told The Telegraph, 'I got a girl at the end of the year, and he said, 'Why do I always say that next year I go to the next class?'
He said, ‘No one has ever told him about the greatness of his sleep.’
The first time this year, the students will find out how important the quality of gold is in reading and writing and at the Atlantic Forum will also improve their general health.
In Harvard Medical School, the professor of psychology and the Greek director Paul Barrera of the University's Helteric Service said students don't sleep enough every week for which the university decided to start this course.
An interactive task has been included in the course for hours.
In a section, there will be a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee coffee, parties, teachers and books to tell about the effect on caffeine and Light and how at least sleep affects Athletic Formers, as well as about the importance of gold in the day.
In the second section, representatives will be told that a lack of sleep can increase the risk of stroke, depression, and cancer.
A screenshot of an interactive icon will be shown, and representatives will be encouraged to think about their daily calendar.
Professor Zesler said, 'We know that students' behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they should have information about this -- just like there's information about the health effects of smoking.
They said that a culture of pride still exists on 'to read and read all night', that the increasing pressure on modern technicians and students means that they need less gold that has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep well enough or not, making sure it's like a 'secret weapon' of the students can cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, they say -- it's also protecting from the impact on the balance because at least their brain is constantly thinking about the food they always eat.
19-year-old Remand Soo of California, who studied chemical and physical biology, founded Professor Jesler's assistant course, and completed his last summer class in Harvard over the past year.
They said they were awake because of the course and sent to the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that all postgraduate students will be required to complete this course before joining the representative institution.
Professor Jesler suggested that students should consider setting a golden alarm before setting up, and also, they should determine when to wake up, and they should be informed of the harmful effects of the blue light from the electronic screen and the LED Light, which can put far more complicated on them, which can cause sleep problems.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1 - 0: Inga vs. Gerard
Because of the strike by Dolly Inga, Rangers had to face a conflict in another match, they were placed on the wrong side of the leading Stephen Gerard's victory 1-0.
After the 4-1 win in St. Johnton in February, the Hebrew side was looking for its first win, but Gary Holt's team grew up as a manager for another racer from Gerard in 18 games, so that the Leader Hearts of the Landbrooks Premierschip could be removed from eight points.
Before the Haff-time, the Inga stratified up to seven minutes and then never found a chance to compare the game to the Rangers' linear-up chart.
Although the Rangers have now arrived at six locations, Livingston has reached the third place and is only from Hebron because of the Golfers.
In addition, after clearly opening the object at the other end of the lineman Kalm Spence, the game may be even more disturbing for Rangers.
Because of the eight changes made on the side of Gerard, the last Iir was given the opportunity to go to the Semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the 11th Lev, which took a point from the previous week's Hearts, and the opposite team was constantly disturbed by the way they had been shot.
Rangers were able to win the match, but Livingston played a lot better than they did.
When Mega first let-off and sent Scott Pitman to the corner of Ellen McGreger, they should only have been given two minutes, but Medfielder missed this great opportunity.
The Kiggin Jacobs in the Dp, when he did free-kick, came to the Kike Captain Craig Hulket, but their defensive partner, Ellen Lithago, could only take a stand.
Rangers got control anyway, but they were more confident in their game than in their final sword.
Alfredo Morelos must have experienced that they should be retired on the Quarter-over market because they and Steven Loles had been kidnapped from each other, but Alfred Steven Thompson had rejected the Colombian appeal.
Rangers saved two shots at Target in the Forst-Haf, but left the Golkiper before Ibro's head of Lasana Colibil and TV Ove of Algeria faced difficulties.
Although, in 34 minutes, Livi's open run of the game could be opposed, but no one can deny that they are the only ones who are entitled to this graph.
Still no better player can play Jacob at the same time in the Rangers Dup.
When the Deckon Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson had peace to pick up Mega for simple finance.
When Gerard sold the cable for Rayan Kent and replaced it with a slot by Winger in Morelos, they had stopped at that time, but the work had blocked their line with good speed.
However, Livingstone showed the audience the same game as they could really enjoy the game, they introduced the long ball with Ling Ball after the long ball.
The site of the Holt in the final stage could have increased their growth, but before moving through Lithov, the Magregreger had successfully stopped Jacobs from studying.
Rangers called Glen Middleton as an option, and they made another complaint for Penalti because they had been involved with Jacobs, but Thomason failed them again.
Elmanak: The founder of the Gezer counter
Now a page of our "Sande Morning" calendar: today, 136 years ago, September 30, 1882, and later... the day the future physicist Johns Williams was born in Germany.
Gizer introduced a device that was later known as Gizer County.
Gizer counter science is a major basis for science, it has become the main foundation of pop culture, and in 1950, it became a film "Bells of Coronado", in which the first time the scientist Roy Rogers and Dell Evans said:
I said, "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a guitar counter that is used to detect radio waves like Suriname.
After you start these phones, you can certainly hear the effects of the gods that are hidden because of radio religion in the streets."
Ivans: "Well, now it's definitely popping!"
The "Hans" guitar was held in 1945, when they were 63 years old.
However, because of their jealousy, their name is still alive.

There are promising results in patients of various cancers in a trial for TK.
A woman was criticized, who saw her injured bones in the defense system, and found that her bleeding cancer had ended for more than 18 months.
In this way, a patient can be removed and replaced with a patient's defense cells, so that they can be replaced with the common protocol found in several patients called HER2, and then re-examine the cells.
Professor of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, Brzofsky said: "We know from our findings that this is a very promising point."
Professor Burzofski said that because of HER2, "the development of a variety of cancers", including blood, debgradation, liver, and coloric cancers.

After the presence of its SNEL, the Kanye West on the MGE Hat complained of the earlier speech of the storm.
It wasn't right
After Kenya's best form of the West, in which he praised the American national leader Donald Tromp and said that their government would become their government in 2020, he complained at the studio during his new life on Saturday.
After his third song on the night of August Town, in which they arrived at Mac America Great Cap, he complained against Democrat and refused to support the Tromp.
They said, “Therefore I speak to the deaf several times, and they say, ‘What is the matter with you, that you may like the deaf, and they are a people who listen?”
Yet, if I had been concerned about Islam, I would have left the United States for a long time."
SNEL began with the chart by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood Star made plans for the fall of Brit Kwanog, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already checking the impact of John's persecution on them by Christine Blassy Ford.
Although nothing has been shown, the media has been uploaded to the Soviet media by the comedian crisis Rock.
It was not apparent whether Rock was trying to escape the West with Posting because of post.
Along with this, West asked the audience to take him to his headway and warn him to go back to the station.
"They threatened me with a backup.
They said, "You must not go to that tent."
They warned me!
They also said, "I'm trapped in the wrong place," according to Washington Agzaminer.
The West said, "You want to see the wrong place?" And they said, "They'll make a trap for my superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to move forward?
Love."
In their comments they mentioned at least two times and felt that the artists of the SNEL were embarrassed, a person in a different report said to the audience: "The whole studio was completely closed."
The song was called West because of the delay in the arrival of Eriana Grande, a few days ago the old baffled rapper Mac miller of the Eriana Grande died.
West gave the song I Love it to surprise many viewers, wearing clothes like a pearl bottle.
The West again met with the head of the Conservative Group TPYS, who tweeted: "Thank you for raising voices for the people."
But, Tok Sho's host host host tweeted that the West is just where he said "what he said and what is completely amazing."
But I did not choose any one to benefit (by buying or selling) his clothes, or by raising a false opinion against my people, or saying, "My people are wrong."
He's free.
So our existence is ours," they said.
Before Shoo, Rapper tweeted on Twitter that they have changed their name, as well as said that they were now "probably going to the Kanya West."
Those who change their names are not former artists, but before that, D.D. and P.D. had also done the same thing that their former names were, in order: P.D. and P.D.
With them were Rapper, Snowp Dog's former name was Snowp Lain, and during the time of the Music, the Prince also changed his name in symbol and then went to the Artist's name.

A 45-year-old was accused of trying to kill a person, who was suspected to have been shot by a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Saturday.
The police said this was happening in Bilhakamor.
On Monday, the rescue party is expected to be brought to the Belfest's Magistrate Court.
Public processing services will review complaints.
The Star Kit Heerington of Game of Thrones raised questions at the University of Toxic
Kit Harington is going to go to their gun-fighting role as John Snow in HBO's Wylent Middle-Founds series game of Thrones.
However, 31-year-old Acter questioned the role of Micho Hiro, saying that many young children are often moved by seeing such roles on screen and feel that it is necessary to work so hard to gain respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt told them that they felt 'something wrong' and asked how to solve the problem of the Mexican Masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kate married her partner from Lesley for 31 years, who believes that they feel 'a lot of strength' to talk about this problem.
They said, 'In particular, I think I'm strong enough that right now -- are we going to make some mistakes by taking the college?'
"Are we teaching men how to cope with problems on screen when they grow up?"
Kitt seems to be partially responsible for the television service for the Mexican public, thanks to its much more men's principal crater.
They said, 'What is it and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street, young boys seem to believe that they should do something to be a man?
In my view, this has indeed been one of the big questions of our day - to - day life — how can we make changes in this regard?
For it is evident that the minds of young men have gone astray.
In an interview, they also believed that when the game of Thrones was back at the end of the next summer, they won't participate in any of it, either in the race or in the race, and they also said they've done a lot of 'war camps and horses' programs.
From November, they will work in the new series of True West from Kate Sam Shepard, a film promoter whose brother writes.
Recently, Etter said that what was best for them in the Game of Thrones is to meet their wife every day.
They said, “This has given me a good life, so I think it has given me a good future, and my life is further rewarded.”
Rose is represented by the role of Ygurt, who is the lover of the poet John Snow at the Amy Avard Winning Foundation.
In June 2018, this couple married with family consent in Lesley, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, 14% increase in new cases in China
China reported that 14% of HIV and AIDS sufferers in the country have increased.
Health authorities have reported that more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from this disease.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In view of recent changes, more and more new cases are being reported because of sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to activated blood transfusions.
In a conference in Greece, health authorities in China said that the number of people suffering from HIV was nearly zero.
Although every year in China, HIV and AIDS sufferers have increased by 100,000.
HIV infection is a serious problem with sex committed by the LEGBIT community in China.
In 1997, equality was promoted in China, but it is said that there is a lot of prejudice against the people of the LGBT community.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with men will marry the last women.
Because of many diseases, sex in these relationships is not safe enough.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve the problem, which is promised to everyone that they will be given access to HIV.
Maxyn Warers denied that their workers had removed the data from the GIP Senator, they told this about 'the last lie' and 'the way to fix'
U.S. representative Maxin Warers reported indisputably on Saturday that one of his employees had posted private information from three republican U.S. Senators on the pages of Loméker's Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the drug test was being carried out by the "Altra-Rite Wing" and by the website.
Lars tweeted on Twitter, "Truth, lies and much more shameful."
As a matter of fact, the information included the address and phone number of the home of the House of Orin Hech of South Carolina and two of Yuta's Senator Lindse Graham and two of Yuta's senators.
This information was also found online by an unknown person who had posted the capital, which was when a person named Bret Kwanong was listening to the attacks of the Senate panel against the Supreme Court.
Three senators were asking questions about missing some information.
Hill says that the E-mail address movement from the main site, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, that identifies the source of the poster, was reported to have been linked to the office of the source and that a worker of the Warrs continued to receive this information.
He said, "This cry is completely disgusting, false and outright lies."
"No worker of mine - whose identity, personal information and security are being put into prison because of these false and false accusations - was not responsible for the loss of this information in any way.
It is a slander, a gross lie and a manifest lie."
He quickly posted an online post for the cleanup of his speech, including the press secretary before White House.
Flasher wrote, "It's anger because of disbelief."
"It is known that their character is not the same as that of Congress.
When any one of you is accused of a crime, you shall not be able to bring charges against him in your name.
They shouldn't be hostile.
They should not be questioned about the person who accused them.
They must remain calm and be patient."
It seemed that compared with the response of Flecher Warers, the judge was complaining about the democracys of Kwanong, and during the hearing of Guruvar, the people accused him of being very angry.
The Republican Uvarro also tweeted on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon to get rid of Lars at Midterm Eleksion.
They tweeted, "That's a big deal, if it's true."
In his speech, Lars said that their officer had warned the proper authorities and law enforcement units for these frauds.
They said, “We will determine whether the guilty will be told or not, and whether they will be judged according to what they have done, or not, for what they have done is extremely bad, and most likely for all of them.”
Johnny English Strings Again’s Review - Rowen Atkinson’s invitation was no longer accepted
From a British point of view, the importance of Brexite in any new film is still considered traditional and it seems to be applied to this novel of Johnny English's ex-Commedic Spof France, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was re-born by the name of Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will we take it for granted that we are certain of what kind of nation's new export opportunities are to talk about?
At any rate, Johnny English has the right to restore many-footed things - which are more important than anything else in his name, is an extensive commercial crisis for people who do not speak English.
They are certainly a soft secret agent who has been able to show Dash Closo of Mr. Ben's Day in Smuthy Glamer in spite of his distinctive roof, and have a dolope for that trap that has added a single note to the Lemme of Fire Theme Tune in 2012 in the 2012 Olympic Opening ceremony.
They are primarily tourists and are the International Man Atkinson of the Secret, whose role in Barkelecard TV media has been forgotten.
Only one or two good hearts are found in this new JE outing.
I liked Johnny English so much that I went to the helicopter where I found a convenient medium-sized suit and showed the rotor leaves on my helmet.
Physical comedying on the screen is a kind of fun for Atkinson, but the game has become less than half angreed, especially 007 and Mission Impossible, such as "Batherin" film brands show themselves with complete confidence as a part of the comedy.
Honey comes like this, not for the elderly, but for the children, and Johnny English's unspoiled mistakes are not very patient with me, and I liked Ben more than much in the silent film of Atkinson.
The political issue is now that there is a serious problem in Great Britain.
The most secret network of British newspapers has been hacked by a cyber-haecher, which has been identified by all British agents who can influence the operation of an agent - it is a sad event for Kevin Elden.
This is the last aid for the wonderful and sufficient stress president, they are already faced with many political and all-for-profit problems: this quasi-terase can provide bacterium with Emma Thompson well, but the script is not too difficult to work on this script.
His good advisers told him that every work has been discussed with Jesus, he will have to bring someone to whom he has been entrusted.
So it meant that Johnny English would have to fight himself, which is now a school master at a post institute, but how an interior operator should be different from a record: there are some good points of speech, as well as reading English at a rock-type university.
English has been sent back to the Emergence White Hall for briefing and Ben Miller's remanded role has been reunited with their old-fashioned sydik buff.
Now that Bob is married, he's been trying to become a Pandubbi commander, his role is for Jolly-hoki-stix, in which he's not got any viki paper.
Therefore, Batman and Robin are faced with a number of serious mistakes in his Majesty's Secret Service when they face the glorious Opelia Balletova of Olga Croelenko.
Meanwhile, the presidents come to the conclusion of the Kirsametic Technique, who claims to have a solution to the computer problems of Britain: Pope Jason Volta took over the role of Jack Lace.
English and blog Forsial Hei-jinks start their own video: they fire in a French restaurant working as a veteran; they protest with the great name of the Volta; and the English fully activates the empire when they try to use a virtual Realty headset to use the interior of the Volta home.
The film has certainly been taken everywhere for the last seconds, but it's still accurate and fun, there's plenty of fun for the kids in the whole movie.
The average level of the canvas.
Besides, as I saw in other Johnny English films, I didn't realize in this film that Rowen Atkinson should be given a role in the British Film Industry or not that is actually due to their talent?
Leber denied that he was planning to work only four days a week for the people of Britain, but the money will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Leber Party is thinking of becoming a national plan, in which British citizens will have to work only four days a week - but money will be paid in five days.
As a matter of fact, the party wants the company's owner, Artificial Intelligence (AI), to give the members part of the protection that will come through the theft, so that they can get another day's release.
This will save the worker three days a week - but they will still get the same amount of oil.
The figures say this idea will be "good" with the economic agent of the party and it is intended to benefit members of the party.
The Trades Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift in the week in order to benefit from the relatively changed economy.
From The Sunday Times a senior worker from the Liberian party said: 'Right-to-right inspection, it is possible to be declared before the end of the year.
'This won't happen all night, but it's about four days' work week, which is entirely consistent with the view of the party's party's party's review party's view in the context of the operational procedure.'
During the 2017 general election campaign, the first party to support this idea will not be part of the Green Party, which promises four days' work week.
However, this wish is not currently fully supported by the Liberian party.
A representative of the Liberian party said: 'The four-day work is not the right of the party week and is not considered by the party.'
Chado Chancellor John McDonald used the last week's summer conference to express his view on social order.
Mr. McDonald said they really wanted to get the power back from 'unforeseen commanders' and 'munakurers' in the use.
The plans of the Shado Chancellor also mean that current operators in water companies can't get back their full share, because the Liberian government can't do it on the basis of what the wrong thing is said.
They also confirmed the plan to allow workers to join the company's boards and create a 10 percent of the private sector's forms for employees, which can benefit up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, says "60 minutes" to tell if the FBI can check Kevin's mind.
The FBI's review of attacks against Justice Bret Kawana lasts at least one week in the Supreme Court on their last name, and it raises the question of whether Bouro's findings helped a Republican senator recover their support.
In a Sunday witness, “60 minutes” speaker Scott Pelle asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey to find out if some of the FBI might be able to influence their hearts to change.
Canadians have come to see more clearly in comparison with their partner in South Carolina.
"Of course, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, 'I spoke to the judge when I was in the audience.'
After that, when this call came, I called them, and said, 'Did you do that?'
Indeed they are a clear authority.’
Although, the root of Graham seems to have been the root of the stone.
"I had thought about Brit Kawana and needed an explosive call for it," they said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret strongly rejected it," Graham went on to mention the Christine Blassy Ford.
And he whom they invoke has not been able to prove.
It's 36 years old.
I shall not be able to change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it been reduced to poverty?
This Saturday will host New York, Global Sitting Festival, which is an annual music program that features many powerful stars, and is the most effective mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the pleasure of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Medes in Central Park Festival, but will also work to increase awareness of the real goal of the very poor eradication programme by 2030.
In 2012, the Global Sitting Festival, an international bird support group, is an extension of the Global Port Project, which actively hopes to end poverty in the number of combatants.
To get non-smooth tickets for the program (except when you're not ready to take the VIP ticket), those going to the concert need to be volunteers to help people become aware of their goal to eliminate the poor, to e-mail a world leader, to call a phone, or to perform "actions" in other simple ways.
But how successful has global trends been in the remaining 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is it the right way to refuse to invite people to act through the free music program, or is it just another case of clickivism - people feel that they are creating differences in the right sense by signing or posting online files?
Since 2011, Global City has said that as efforts for various objectives continue to be made, it has over 19 million "actions" with its supporters.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in terms of representations and trends, which are determined to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group launched 390 protests and declarations using their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been distributed or sold.
The group estimates that security has had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some leaders are involved in protests, The Power of Innovation, a U.S. State Investigators and Activists, who are responsible for providing Rwanda with $35 billion to help people develop their full potential after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the world's citizens.
During a live concert in London in April 2018, President Tresy Olman of Newtration said, "British government, donors, national government, and you, as the world’s citizens, can make social injustice history a fotonote."
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the U.S. to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced a project called Power of Innovation, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with a diet approach.
A question that most people ask on their website is, "Why do you think we can eliminate the very poor?"
The Global City answered: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But we will be able to deal successfully with one another, just as the great civil authorities and the disparagement of colors are ours, for we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Vikings, Sean Meddes, Cardie B, General Monai New York is one of some of the showers who will show in this year's program, which guests will do in Debra-Lefence and Hu Jacman.
The U.S. can be used to create barriers to Russian exports - internal truth
The Washington Examiner's airway, internal real Rainy Jinke revealed that Washington, if necessary, can help the American invasion to stop Russian forces in American markets with the Middle East.
Jinke complained that Russia's work in Syria - especially where he is working on the invitation of a fair government - is a challenge to identify new energy markets.
They said, "It is because of their presence in the Middle East from my mind that they want to prove their zeal, as they have done in southern Europe, Eastern Europe.
And, according to the authority, there are ways and means of doing this.
"The United Kingdom has the ability to ensure that the sea routes are open to us, and, if necessary, to prevent them from entering the market," they said.
A useless group, Jinke, was talking about people in the program organized by Consumers Energie Alliance, who call themselves "the voice of a force user" in the United States.
They compared Washington's view to extracting from Russia and Iran what they said that they are effectively equal.
Referring to Russia as a "a moving tothu" based on biofuels, they said, "The economic options for Iran and Russia are to take advantage of and replace them."
It is explained that the Tropical Administration, taking place in Russia, is on the mission to increase the export of its refined natural gas in Europe as the best option for European users.
To that end, the authorities of the Tropical Administration, with the US President Donald Tromp himself, tried to get Germany out of the "Inaccurate" North Stream 2 Pipeline project, which, according to the storm, has made Berlin a "bound" by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the current Pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely financial project.
Kremlin's argument is that the extensive opposition of Washington to the project is only caused by financial reasons and is an example of the correct response.
Russian Army Prime Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State in September, "I believe we share the idea that force pressure cannot be a tool and that users should be able to select representatives."
The Germans of the U.S.R. protested, reconfirming their opposition to the project.
The Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI) of the German Federation called for the removal of the European Union's force law and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow from the United States.
The head of the Federation of German Indrege (BDI), D.C., said after the recent meeting between the Russian Chancellor Angela Markel and the Russian Nationalist Vladimir son, "When a great government supports our forces, I feel very distressed.
The Senator of Massachusetts said that Elizabeth Varen would "think with courage" about being involved in the nationalist movement in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would "think with courage" after the Middle Ages election.
During the tunnel hall in Hollywood, Warren confirmed that he would consider taking part in the train.
According to The Hill, they said, "The time has come to go to Washington for women and to join our corrupt government and also to be a woman on the top."
"After November 6, I will think seriously about fighting for the election for the term of citizenship."
Warren gathered the nationalist Donald Tromp during the Town Hall, saying, "They're taking this account in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what the Donald Tromp is doing for our people at last," they said.
Warren, Tromp and their Supreme Court are engaged in the discussion of Brit Kawana.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We really need to check the FBI before Monday."
However, a further survey in Thursday showed that most constituents of Warren do not think they should fight the 2020 election.
According to the Suffok University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Pool, eight percent of Massachusetts's "expensive" estimates said that the senator should not fight for election.
Thirty percent supported this choice.
More support was shown in the case of the election by former Governor Hall Patrick, where 38 percent supported possible participation in the election race and 48 percent opposed.
In the names of other high-profile Democrats who have been collected to fight the election by 2020, former national administrators, including Biden and Vermont Senator Burny Sanders.
Biden said they would decide officially until January, the United States Press reported.
Saara PTSDs the PTSD of Palin in the line of the Donald Tromp
26-year-old truck Paulin died in Iraq a year after being drafted into the army in September.
They were arrested on the night of a domestic violence
Toulsa, in Oklahoma, in a rally for the Donald Trop, said to the audience, "I know what my son is doing after returning from the moment he feels like he's back because of other families who feel the impact of PTSD and who come back with our troops."
Paulin said to his prisoner "hand in the chamber" and said about his son and other officers, "They return with a little change, they come back hard, they think it's due to the honour of their fellow soldiers and fugitives, and every other member of the army has sacrificed to the country."
According to a representative of the Villa police department, Dan Bennet was arrested on Monday in the village of Alaska and charged with violence against a woman and murdering her in her arms.
18 The Kingdom — A D.C. — Supports the Challenge of Safety
The Eighth Government and the Columbia District are supporting a new American law that supports the legal issue that refuses to escape the group or to escape victims of domestic violence.
The NBC News reported that 18 states and Jille's representatives held a court-martial in Washington to support a refugee who challenged justice.
In August the fight against collective rights has not opened up the full name of the sky in the Deer Grace Construction Session of the American Civil Liberties Union.
He said his companions "and the sons of his violent group" abused them, but the U.S. authorities rejected their request for release on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
Greek-supported government officials described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries facing a wide range of problems of group and domestic violence, which make a large number of applicants for American refugees.
The New American Refugee Law replaced a 2014 decision given by the Travelling Appeal Board that allowed homeless refugees to flee from domestic violence to be called for to flee.
In a statement to the District of Colombia, General Carl Resin said in a statement in February that the new rule "is ignoring the Kingdom, the United Nations and the International Law."
"The collective law expects that all asylum claims should be judged on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such an objection violates those principles," the judge-in-law said.
Atorni explained in the newspaper that the so-called denial of the right to freedom of movement by immigrants is damaging the American state of affairs that it is more likely to become their citizens and to be "required of the necessary order".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the District Justices to seek asylum in June and not release the victims from collective violence.
In his June 11 speech on justice, he said, "Those who leave their homes because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or any particular social group's membership are safe."
Sleep was never all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people all over the world face every day.
The number of those who die in the race for the salvation of those who survive the coming end of the great tribulation
For the survivors, the situation was too serious.
"This seems to be very serious," said 35-year-old Lisa Kosuma, providing comfort to children suffering from pain in the city centre of Tahsh-Nahs.
"Every minute brings an embulence to tears.
The pure water is the drink of boiling water."
And it was seen when they returned to their own house, and they lifted up their voice, and all that they had, and sought to save them.
7.5 And hundreds of people were killed in the earthquake, and the hospital was broken down.
Dr. Harris and some dead men, who were facing the storm and the storm, were outside the palace of Paulu's army, where patients were being treated publicly because of the constant shocks of the earthquake.
His eyes were filled with tears as he saw the tears of those who had been oppressed, who had been with his wife and his daughter, in the bedroom of his fifth sanctuary.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped in the wall of the castle," Harris said to the Society's Press, and told them that their family was in the city for marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then I died.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Prime Minister accused China of "warning"
A week after China's four-page advertising campaign was launched, a Chinese government reporter in a daily U.S. newspaper, using the US press to preach in Beijing.
U.S. Secretary of State Donald Tromp referred to the Chinese side of the country’s flag in China’s Register, which rejected the complaint after the most critical news report - Des Moines, after attempting to appear at the Congress's elections on November 6th, China rejected the complaint.
The claim of the Tromp that he was trying to take action in the American elections, the U.S. authorities told Reuters that Washington was a new step in the process of creating pressure on China.
While it is common for advertising to promote trade for foreign governments, vegetation and Washington are now engaged in a growing trade that has seen them apply themselves to one another's imports.
Chinese and American specialists say that trade was designed to attack exporters in countries, such as China's former Chinese border-salk Ioova, which supported the Tromp's Republican Party.
Terry Brunsted, former president of the United States and the long-term governor of Iowa, told China's chief exporter of treasure-related property that Beijing has been causing damage to American citizens, individuals and businesses.
Brenstead wrote in his mind at the Ten Moines Register of Wednesday that China, "Now we are preaching in our own free press and double the mess."
"In our preaching campaign, with the publication released in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is benefiting from the rich coverage of American freedom of expression and freedom of press," Brenstead wrote.
"In view of the fact that the media is shut down in the strong arm of the Chinese Communist Party, contrary to this, on New Zealand's road along the road, you will find limited disgruntled voices and no real representation of those who are in need will show China's concern for the financial situation," they wrote.
They said, "One of the main newspapers in China has rejected the offer to publish their article," although they did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Pre-repudiation of women's medals prior to the election of the Republican Middle Ages with the departure of Kawan, researchers warned
Since the Supreme Court, which is facing many accusations of persecution in the Supreme Court, supports and protects Brit Kawana, the analyst has warned that they will respond, especially from women, during future media elections.
Its heart-broken feelings are quite widespread, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with Medadan.
These things can't be returned," Grant Reher, a professor of political science at the University of York City's Maxwell University told De Hail about an article published on Saturday.
Rihar said they doubt that Senator Jeff Flek (Arizona) would be enough to calm down the pressure media in the last minute to check the FBI.
According to a news report from Washington D.C., a leading adviser to the progressive group of MoveOn said, "Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither will they forget about tomorrow nor in November."
On Friday morning, when the Republicans who control the judiciary wanted to proceed with the name of Kawana despite the testimony of Dr. Kristen Blassy's Ford, representatives in the south of the Senate complained, "Noble is coming!" Mike reported.
A non-governmental analyst, Stu Rothenburg, told the new site, "Democratic zeal and movement are getting out of the chart."
People say it's a long time ago, it's true.
But it can be even more, especially among women in sub-urbans and 18-29-year-olds, who often don't steal when they don't like the nationalist."
Before the public witness described the attacks of a person named Suprem Court, describing the persecutions of John the Baptizer, researchers had said that if they continued with the evidence of the Republic, it would be possible to oppose it.
According to the NBC News, former president Michael Steel of the National Committee of the Republic said, "This has become a huge mess for the GOP."
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or Kawana about sending to the bank, it's also about how the Republican has handled it and how they have dealt with them," the president of the U.S. president of the Office of the Democratic People's Party, Guy Cecill, took note of the New Channel.
However, the United States has been divided into a number of limits in this case, showing which of the Meddengers of Ford and Kavana witnesses, most of whom were watching Kawana.
A new survey by YouGov reveals that 41 percent of respondents believed in the testimony of a certain or possibly ford, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavan.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kawana had lied during his testimony, or certainly, while only 30 percent said that about the forum.
Following the pressure from Flickr, the FBI is currently working for and, with at least one other freerid, debora Ramirez, reported.
Ford took the last week's oath and testified before the Senate court that Kevin married him at the age of 17.
Ramirez's complaint is that the name of the Supreme Court showed his relatives when they attended a party while they were reading in the island in 1980.
Plans to launch a new Internet in opposition to Google and Facebook by the World Wide Web
The World Wide Web's favorite team Burners-leather started a startup that wants to break down Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the scientific legend, Inrupt, is a company that creates open source platform Solid of Burnersley.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed to access the information.
In a special witness with Fest Company, Burnersley in Mazak said that he wanted to get the "World Wars" after Inrupt.
"We have to do it now," they said about Startup.
"This is a historic moment."
Use Solid to allow people to create their own "private online data store" or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and business devices.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time on a browser.
The strange thing about personal online data store is that it fully depends on the user how much information can be obtained.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea, the company needs to acquire resources, processes and proper skills to make solid available to all.
The company currently has a security platform sold by Burners-ley, Bruce, IBM, some on-stage developers, and a group of volunteer codes.
From this week on, the global economic developer of Inrupt website can make their own self-sustained inventions.
Burnersley said he and his team "Facebook and Google are not talking about whether or not the whole change will be started, where all of their business models will be complete at night.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post published on the Media on Saturday, Burners-ley wrote that Inrupt's "Mission Solid" must provide technical energy and local systems to help protect the accuracy and quality of the new web created by the Mission solid.
In 1994, Bernersley changed the Internet when they installed World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Linet has been playing a powerful voice in the station.
As long as Inrupt is launched, Burners-ley World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will be the organizers and organizers.
"I look forward to this future period of the web," Burners-ley said.
Bernard Won: WW1 Victoria Cross Clearing Attack
During World War I as a war in Victoria Cross, the only church in England who won the battle was the priest of his home in his city for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Von won this battle in Bellenglish and Lehocort on September 29, 1918.
Although, four days later, they were killed by a snapshot and they never knew they had won the highest British army.
On Saturday, their two-legged memorial stone was recorded in the Praddeshden, in Northamptonshire.
One of their ancestors, Michael Van said it was "a symbol of a great cloud" that their grandfather's celebration of victory was being canceled 100 years later.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel von led his battalion in Canal D cent-Qentin, "under heavy rubber and machinery in the field of war".
Then they went up to the fireline and, with "great curiosity", led the army-number before taking the only field-gun and encouraged three pieces.
Just a month before the end of the war on October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Von was killed by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Van said that in their grandfather's career, "there were some things I know can never be equal, but those we've got."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also made a dedication after the party, which led by the Brindwood Imperial Yuth Band.
Michael Van said they "are very honored to play a role in the parade" and they said, "with the support of many people, a real leader is being shown the courage of a real leader."
The MMA's blessed ballater is awake all night to see 206, but they've got Pope Pig instead.
Imagine, you've been living to see 206 balloons all night long, but you've been distracted by the main program.
San Jose's Bill had 13 opponents, six of them on the main cards and a whole night live on the U.S. Channel 5.
On the morning of the 6th game, as Gegard Mosse and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, they were tired of changing into the Pope Pig of the U.S.
There were some great disappointment after staying awake until the morning for the fight, especially.
On Twitter, a president described switching to the children's card as "a kind of disease problem".
When asked about the program, President Vice-President Dave Swartz said, "This content was not applicable to the government in the morning for 6 games, so they had to change to children's programming."
""Pappa de Pig," yes."
President Scott Koker of the Belater Company said they're working on their schedule to join the U.S. audiences in the future.
"When I think of Rapla, I think we might find a solution," said Koker.
"But there will be six mornings in the morning, and we will not be able to work it until their appointed time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it changed, many of the texts were being heard, and they were not all fit.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't, it was a government policy.
I can promise you that it won't be the next time.
We'll keep it in place of six to five -- as we usually do -- and when we tried to do more for the praisers, it got more.
This is an indistinct situation."
Degert Island Disc: Tom Deli felt 'no' in terms of efficiency
Olupik Gothacher Tom Deley says he was so upset about his work that he was moved to make a success of it.
24-year-old Dale said he didn't feel it until he got into high school and said, "Everyone's not like me."
Lauren Lowern, speaking on a 4-digit Island Disc previously presented by Radio, said he was talking about homosexual powers to give others a "expected" hope.
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics when he became a father.
The regular representative of Sho Sho's long-term, Kersty Young, has been released for months because of the disease.
While showing himself as a social-friendly person in the first program in Lavern, Dale said that she felt "a little" in comparison to everyone because "the boys and girls were not socially acceptable."
He said, ‘Today, those who have made themselves feel inferior to others are the ones who have given me the power to succeed.’
He wanted to prove that he was a "special" person. He said, "Never will anyone be disappointed when they have finally learned about his deeds."
Two times, the Russian Olympic theme winner has become the HI-profile LGBT publisher and has used its presence in this year's national games to appeal to more countries to reduce gender.
She said that she was open because she felt very nervous and wanted to give others a "hope" when she could live without having to worry.
Three times the World Championship said a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, from whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Deli married Oscar, who is 20 years old, but said that the age was never a time.
"When you go through so many experiences at the age of 14, she went to Olypic at the age of 14, and her father died three years after cancer -- she said that it was difficult to find a young person who had been exposed to such experiences.
In June, his wife, Robert Rey Black-Delli, became the father of a son, and Deli said that his "all views" had changed.
"If you asked me the last year, it'd all be related to 'I need to win the sky fight'," they said.
"You'll know, there are more things than the Olympics.
My Ollipik is Robbie's Blue Squad."
Their son's name is like his father, Robert, who died after his 40-year-old death in 2011.
Dellie said her father didn't accept that they were going to die and that the last time they wanted to know if London had arrived at the 2012 tickets - because they wanted to sit in front line.
He said, "I can't tell them you won't sit in the front line, Dad."
He said, “When they found it they did not see it, I held back their hands, and I seized them, and they were not able to withstand it.”
The following year, Dellie participated in the Olympics and won the election prize in 2012.
"I just knew that this was the one I've seen my whole life dream -- it was nothing better than to hang in front of the team of the Olympics," he said.
It also inspired their favorite song-proud Bay Heather Smoll -- who were standing with them while the Olympics were preparing and who still heard their voices.
The Dutch disc will be displayed on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form miquelon out of the radar cap of Saturday
American Phil Mikalson will set up records on Sunday when they will play their 47th driver cap match, but they will have to change their shape to save it from being an undisclosed mile stone.
On the 12th time for record, Michaelson was released from the game by Captain Jim Furic for Forbols and Forum on Saturday.
Instead of becoming an attraction center, as they are often serving for the United States, the main winner of five times spent his day among the winners and hoping to improve his way of playing.
Not even directly driving on their career career, the 48-year-old player won't compete for the golf national course, where those who are not active for a long time are regularly punished with the wrong shots.
And where the course is not so easy, there will be the British Open Champagne Franco Molinary in front of Michaelson's new match, which this week have played with Roki Tommy Fleetwood to win all their four matches.
If the American players who start four points below the 12 singles matches are forced to start, Michaelson's match can be quite important.
Furic trusted her husband, not that they could say anything else.
He said, “They fully understood their role, so they put me behind their backs and told me that they would be prepared for it.”
"He's very confident of himself.
He's Hall of Farmer and he's been doing a lot of work for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think of playing her two games.
I had more idea, but how did it work, and how we thought we should proceed?
He wants to go out there like everyone else."
Michaelson will pass the record of the next Faldo record for the most played radar cap match on Sunday.
This can mark the end of the driver's cap career that has never seen their personal record heights.
Michaelson won 18 wins, 20 has won, and seven has won, although Furic said his presence brings some interference in the team.
They said: "He is a sorcerer, a madman, a man who likes to have fun, and he is a licentious liar."
"I think young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which they were pleased to see.
He does not give more than play.
The European captain Thomas Burn knows that big growth can soon be lost
Thomas Bourne, the European captain, knows from his experience that the driver's hat can change much more easily in one day than in the last day.
Dan showed his first exhibition in Valderama in May 1997, where a bird in the capital of Seva Ballastiros had gained five numbers on the Americans, but with the victory of 141⁄2-131/2, at least Marjin, only reached the finish line.
"We remind ourselves that we had a great leader in Valderama; our great leader in Brooklyn, where we were, and in Valderama, we just won," said Bourne, after seeing the increase of 10-6 in the Gulf National on February 5-3 and yesterday, after seeing the increase in 10-6.
So history will show me and all the team that it's not over.
You'll be out of your mind tomorrow.
Get out there and do the right thing.
This will not end until you reach the end of the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this traffic and this is where to keep focus.
I always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware that the world's biggest players are on the other side."
Bourne said, "How did their players show up on the golf course?
Tomorrow is a different time.
Tomorrow's personal show will come, and it's a different thing.
When everything is going well, it's best to go there with the partner, but when you leave there personally, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
This is a message which must be sent to players in order to show their highest priority.
You leave your companion behind, and you will come to know him, and he will be made to appear before you in glory."
In contrast to Bourne, contrasted figures, Jim Furyk will be looking for a better personal appearance for his players that they had done as a partner, Obad Jordan Sphere and Justin Thomas, who had received three of the four figures.
Before facing war because of the "miracles in Medina" by Europe, the Führer himself is on both sides of the opposition of those great last days in Brooklyn."
"I remember every breath," they replied in response to the question, "How did Captain Ben Crensho handle his players in 1999 last day?"
"We have 12 important games yesterday, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this speed is over, it puts a lot of pressure on the relationships between them.
We have established our line of reckoning, and We have joined people as we have felt, you know, We are trying to do some other miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to get the answer to the attack by Rory Maclero in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Herme, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Potter are the main parts of the European order.
"I've created a group in this order because I think it covers all of them," Burn said about his own choices.
A New Battle of Germany Resurrected
In 2014, new warheads in Germany had to be commissioned to change the warheads of the Cold War-wars, but because of the increasing speed of criminal systems and speeds, the local media said that it would not be that way for at least the next year.
According to a military operator's report, the "Reinland-Palfz" commission, which is the main ship of the warships of the New Baden-Wartemberg category, has now been halted to the first image of 2019.
Pot should have been involved in the crisis in 2014, but post-divisive stress factors have influenced the role of the massive project.
In 2007, ships of the four Baden-Wortemberg class were ordered back in 2007 to be taken as a representative of the long-acted Bramen-class warheads.
It is understood to be a powerful blow, an anti-aircraft and an anti-ship missiles, along with a series of steel techniques such as low noise, noise and sound equipment.
Other important features include long-term maintenance - it is possible to trace the latest warheads for up to two years from foreign ports.
Despite the fact that the nuclear war - which allows Germany to find a chance of a white project in foreign countries - will be delayed until the time of entry into service, Di Xin commented.
The F125 War pot was a swarthy battery last year, when the German Nósena officially refused to fire the pot and returned the Bloom and Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Nahuatl brought a ship back to the ship’s builder after Delivary.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but the German media promoted a number of important "Software and Hardware Crimes", which left the war on the mission of war.
Software cuts were particularly important because the Baden-Wortemberg-class ships will be operated by a group of 120 passengers - only half of the military forces of the old Bramen team.
In addition, it is also based on the fact that the ship is more critical than its appearance and restricts the ability to connect to the future.
In the second world war, 7,000 tons of "reland-polluz" is believed to be heavily driven by ships of the same class as Germans used in the second world war.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the value of the whole project tag - including the training of the team of drivers - is becoming a point.
It is said that it has reached from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problems of new conflicts that have become particularly important in the light of the warning of the Halia are undermining Germany's military power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Society's Security Council, admitted that "the nuclear-powered vessels are actually ending."
The officer said, "The weather has been severed since the old ships were being used, but no replacements have been made.
They said that none of the Baden-Wortemberg Wars were capable of being in danger.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of the blind.
The aim of a new search being conducted at an estate in Scotland is to discover how they use natural appearance in their hunting for bright food.
It is hoped that the treatment of the unusual explosives will put new strains on the behavior of the explosives and will help to identify future safety processes.
In a study conducted by scientists from the National Trust in Scotland, general and soprano Pipistreles will be followed by doubent candles sitting in the inner garden of West Ross.
Special records will be placed at the main locations around the editor to track the speeds of light bulbs throughout the period.
NHS workers and self-employed detectors will also use mobile surveillance.
The version of the bat call from a special audio analysis of all recording records and what the nations are doing.
Then there will be the design and report of nature for a picture of their behavior on a wide range of landscapes.
Rob Herr, NTS' natural security adviser, hopes that the results will show that some areas of nature-life are the most important and how they are used by every nation.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management activities, such as how to make Woodlands well for the construction of the forest field and what kind of lighthouses and other related nations.
In Scotland and throughout the U.S., there have been enough earthquakes in the past century
They are at risk of construction and development, which affect birds' nests and damage natural life.
The Pwan Turbin and the lighting system can also cause damage, as some of the chemical treatments of flaipepeter and building materials, as well as the damage caused by parental bills, can also be harmful.
The lights are not really dark.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their habit.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect errors and barriers in their flight path.
NTSC, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major cities and 76,000 hectares across the country, brings the flashlight with great seriousness.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly monitor and sometimes protect birds' eggs.
The organization has established the first and only dedicated Bat Rezireve of Scotland in Dmfriz and the Trive Estet of Gallove, Scotland, which is home to eight of the ten shining peoples of Scotland.
Estet Manager David Thompson says Estet has a better place for them.
"We have a good area for lighting here in Triva," they said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good natural life.
But there are a lot of things about light that are still unknown, so what we're doing here and other things will help us to understand what they need to do."
They stress the importance of the inspection of the lamp before it is kept inside the material, as it is possible that 400 mothers and children may be destroyed from the destruction of the mother-in-law of the unborn child, perhaps removing the entire local waste.
The lights are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to kill them, to persecute them, or to destroy their bones.
Elizabeth Ferrel, Scottish director of the Bat Conference Trust, urged the people to come forward for help.
They said: "We have more knowledge of our dreams and we do not know how much they weigh."
Ronaldo took advantage of the threats of violence, while the officials sentenced him to a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo called their opponents 'false news' saying that people want to preach in the streets using their names.
Their advocates are the judge of the German newspaper Der Spigel, who published the charges.
In 2009, in the room of the Hotel of Las Vegas, Portugal and Juventes, the U.S. woman Catherine Mejorga was attacked by a woman named Catherine Mejorga.
Dere Spigel reported in his report on Friday that he had spent $375,000 on a woman to keep her secret about the event.
Ronaldo, 33 years old, told the reports "false news" about his 142 million followers following the flood report.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today they say, it's the Persian news, "Balen D'Vieta said five times in the camera.
"They want to preach themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be popular in my name, but it's part of their work.
I am a good man, and everyone is good."
Ronaldo's lawyer, Der Spigel, is preparing to take action on those charges, according to Reuters, which he called "inspired reports of misinformation in the privacy area".
Wakil Christian Shorts said that players "will demand morale in Russia according to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years."
The event is said to have occurred in June 2009 in Las Vegas's Pams Hotel and in one of the casinos.
According to the newspapers held in the court of Nawada, after meeting in a net club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room as they spoke to him.
The Mayorga complaint is that Ronaldo died after the incident and told them that "99 percent" was a "good person" who was disappointed by "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that this couple had sex, but it was agreed.
Mayorga's claim is that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later she agreed to argue out of court because she felt "frequency" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
34 years old says she's trying to end this agreement now because she's been suffering since the incident.
Ronaldo, who was mentioned at the time of the attack, was at the ready to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester, U.S.A., and sold €100 million with the Italian digges.
Brixt: The U.K. needs 'to be searched for 'the public'
Business real Greg Clark said that the U.S. would be "for us" if he lost his career as world leader in the construction of a car after Brexit.
They said that Toota U.K. had told the BBC that if Britain had abandoned the European Union, it would temporarily stop its production in Bernstone near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that in the case of No-dell Braxite, the border may have an impact on the shipyards.
The Burnstone Plant - which is produced by Oris and Venus of Toyota - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if the European Union exits at the end of the British March, we will stop production."
Other U.S. car manufacturers have promised to leave the EU without consent how to trade across borders with Honda, BMW and GUW.
For example, BMW says he'll shut down his mini planet for a month after a break in Oxford.
Car manufacturers say that the main concerns are related to the damage caused by car accidents in the state of Node Braxite.
Toota's production is run on the "just-in-time" line, in which both the U.S. and the European Union bring copies of media-to-order cars every 37 minutes.
If the U.S. leaves the European Union without any trade, there may be restrictions on the border, according to the U.S.
The company said that it would be impossible to have more than one day inenterprising in its drambisaire planet for Toota, so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the "Calibrates in Theresa's "Calibrated to protect from these tests at a clean limit" for sexual relations with the European Union.
"We need a deal. We want a better deal that can bring happiness not only now but also to get this opportunity," they told the BABY Radio 4 student program.
"Not only Toota but other creations have found evidence that we should be able to continue it fully, which is the most successful set of solutions."
Toota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long run, warned that the system's performance would be reduced by an additional rate and that the ships would eventually leave.
Peter Suvalris, who has worked in Bernstone for 24 years and who are the organizers of the United Nations at the agency, said that their members are too concerned: "When these ships leave, they will never return after they leave.
One official said, "We have advanced a genuine and credible plan for our family relations with the European Union."
According to the White House, a meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed
White House told Friday that the battle against the General Road Rosenstein with the Dutch Tropt could be fought for "one and a week later" because the Supreme Court's hope of fighting against Brit Kawan is in progress.
Rosinstein, special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who are examining the possible barriers to justice between Russia's electoral authorities, the Tropists, and the Russians.
The Tropp dept will or will not release the Attorney General, and the news that the child's freedom is in danger has been fueled by the attacks of Washington for months.
Early this month, New York Times reported that Rosinstein discussed the possibility of refusing to record talks with the Trop and removing the national owner by 25 years of research.
Rosenstein broke the report.
But last Friday they went to White House among these news, that they are the ones who are going to pass through.
Instead, a meeting was announced with the trumpet, which was then in the United States in New York.
Tromp said they would "not like" to remove Rosinstein, but then the Senate Chamber of Justice was held in a meeting to stop the strike, in which the woman who accused him of John's abuse, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, both testified.
On Friday, the Trop ordered a week's FBI check on Taiwan's battle lines, which was delayed in the Senate's complete defense.
The impression of the trip was true Sara Sanders, focusing on the news on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set for him, this week, I can see that all other cases with the Supreme Court can be brought forward one week later.
But we shall see, and I will always like to keep up with the news."
Some journalists claim that the Sanders have not reported White House's press since September 10.
The mayor asked Chris Wallace why he was doing this.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing was not due to the "existence" of the TV interviewers, but they said, "I'm not surprised that they're here."
He also suggested that direct contact between the tramp and the press be increased.
He said, “The people of the land are more likely to question one another.” And he said, “We have seen their numbers.”
The briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "If the United Kingdom has an opportunity to ask a direct question from the U.S. Secretary of State, it is better to talk to me.
We're trying hard to do this, and you've seen us doing it a lot in the past few weeks, and when you can talk to the President of the United Kingdom, it's going to be a good news."
When the White House leaves or participates in public sessions or when it is attended by people in the press conference, the trumpet provides a regular response to questions.
One press conference is missing.
This week in New York, the nationalist showed himself to the journalists who were present, and several times it may show why.
Healthy NHS in Scotland writes to the workers of the European Union about the hopes of Brexit
Health Truth wrote to workers of the European Organization working in the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and to stay behind behind Braksit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter of less than six months to the European Union.
The Scottish government has already been unable to meet the demands for citizens of the European Union working in its own public services.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The gap between farmers, the U.S. and the European Union continues to grow towards the expected decisions.
But the U.K. government is also making progress on its preparations for possible non-dial appearance.
I know it'll be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat now how important it is that I pay no attention to the nationality of every staff member.
The European Union, and its fellow workers, and its valuable experience and expertise, which strengthen and improve the work of the health and welfare of the sick and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercromby's contemporary treasurer after the fall of the head
Tennis Mike Organ said that the Tennis State Tigers, who were facing 31-27 on Saturday from the Wenderbilt Commodor, had committed suicide following the crimes committed by Christian Abercromby.
The chief court of the Tunisian state, Rod Red, told the speakers that it had just begun a few days before the fall.
"He came to the border and just fell there," Red said.
Teachers and medical workers gave him an oxidation on the site before he went back to the string and returned to the next rating.

Stocks will be taken from foreign purchases when buying goods in the U.S.
When foreign merchants buy property in the U.S., they will be taken from high-stamp duti, which will be used to help homeless people under new tower schemes.
This action will undermine the success of the corbin mechanism to attract young people
The printed page will be printed on behalf of those who do not have permission to do so in the U.S.
Trager expects it to add up to £120 million in a year to help homeless people.
The U.S. high-level stamp duty on the sale of foreign goods is being prepared - which will be used for the benefit of the homeless today.
This action is seen as an attempt to ensure the success of Jeremy Corbin's organization, which is attracting young participants with the words to provide more effective home delivery and high-ranking workers.
The Stamp Duty growth will be based on individuals and forms that do not interfere with the U.S. growth, which will increase the ability of the government to deliver money from those who are rich under government conditions.
In addition to the current Stamp Duty, which includes the sale of two houses and rents that were started two years ago, there may be a maximum of three percent.
Trazier is expected to grow to £120 million in a year.
According to estimates, 13 percent of newly developed London assets are sold by non-U.S. residents, which are growing in prices and it is difficult to keep pace on the first time for the purchases.
Many rich areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "the city of heaven" because there are more foreign merchants who spend most of their time out of the country.
A few weeks after the invitation to help more young people to build their first home by the new Justice Boris Johnson, they were invited to attend the Stamp Duty.
They cut down the land on large structures but threatened to take over the prices of the wealth they did not use, and asked for money on cheap houses to fix Britain's "lifelessness".
Mr. Corbin has announced the stirring harvest of proposed housing improvements, including the end of the negotiations between Kiraya Control and No-Folt.
They want to give more powers to make new houses.
She said, "Last year, I said I'd dedicate my favorite to returning to British sleep -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means to repair our broken home.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and build lives.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-members to associate with foreign-based companies as it is to buy homes for the British people who work.
For many people, the dream of welcome has been a long way off, and the smell of gold is very real in extreme circumstances."
Jack Ross: 'My last anniversary must be managed by Scotland'
Bos Jack Ross of Sydney says they should be Scotland's manager in a "last week" step.
42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is now in the third place in Lig van, and which is three miles away from the top.
They went to the stadium of light in the summer following the direction of St. Miren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and just said, "Ros told the sportsound of the BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up with my father from childhood to see Scotland in Hampden, and it's always something that brings me back.
This time will come when I will succeed in managing the club."
As manager of St. Landland, Dick Advocate, David Moise, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canyio are among the former Russians.
The former Eloia Athletic Bos says they had no sense of following the names established in such a large club, which had previously rejected the first of Barnsley and Episwich Towns.
"If I fail, I can be assured that I can return this club to my favorite league."
Because of the design of this club and its advantages, it certainly comes to the lovers League," they said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I might see myself here as a success if I could get the club there."
As Dumberton's assistant boss and after spending 15 months in the cooking staff of the Hearts, Rose's manager has been in charge of careers for only three years.
Then they helped to deliver Eloah out of the hand of Tyre the third part of Tyre, and to set off the army of the Champagne with the sword of the Chaldeans at the next session.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable compared with the work done during their careers in Clyde, Hartulpole, Falkirk, St. Miren and Hamilton.
They said, "Maybe this was a real four-way deal."
"I really believed that management was more appropriate for me than playing.
It looks like it's because I did the right thing, did the right thing, and enjoyed some specific heights.
But playing can be hard.
You need to get a lot of stuff on a weekly basis.
I still care for the pressures and pressures of the work, but everything seems to be fine in the management.
I always wanted to manage, and now I am doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable of my entire life."

The pressure on the hottest has increased Britain's combative popes, but it has put more pressure on restaurants.
Peb and the group saw a 2.7% increase in Bikri in July -- but the restaurants were under 4.8 percent lower, data revealed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultency CGA, who compiles data, said: "The link in the world's expected share of tobacco and England means that the pattern was followed in the last June, when the pope was 2.8 percent above, except that the restaurant had to face more difficulties.
In the restaurant business, 1.8 percent of the deaths in June were even worse in July.
Pebe and others who sold wine showed the strongest taste compared to the restaurant.
Food-induced pubs also had to be damaged by smoke, although restaurants aren't as toxic as drivers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For the month, all the fathers and once again, the number of drunks increased by 6.6 percent, when three percent of the food was consumed.'
Paul Neuman, space and guest analyst RSM said: "These results have continued to be seen by us since the end of April.
The impact of weather and capital social or game events on the market outside the home is the biggest factor for Bikri.
This is no surprise that the restaurant groups have continued to fight, although there will be a 4.8 per cent increase per year in Bikry, especially when it comes to pressing pressure.
The days of the people who lived in long days could not have been worse than the days of those who spent on food and drink, and the time will come when they will say, "Let us see if what we have spent in the middle of the night is the best way of life."
In July, there was a 2.7 percent increase in the entire bikire, with new openings, showing the slow pace in the brand-out.

Compared with the songs of mothers by dance film media, online has created a conflict in the minds of people
A dance company shared an online show that compares smoking mothers to smoking dogs.
To mark the launch of a product called "The First Brest Bomb of the World", user tag company Elvie has launched a new Moscow Musical Video-enforced publication, which allows new page parents to express themselves.
The four who are in the cave of the cave say to one another: "Yes, I suffer from thirst, but I do not ask you any questions." And if you do not consider these things, they are not mine.
The course continues: "Pimp It Out, Pimp It Out, Pimp It Out, I Am Feeding Dam Bebeze, Pimp It Out, I Am Melking My Lady."
In any case, the media, published on the Facebook page of the form, is the cause of online dialogue.
With 77,000 observers and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many have said that it reflects the "inflammity" of the Diary Force.
"It's a very bad decision to use songs for advertising this product.
They need to be born as we are, to become pregnant and give birth to babies, except that their children are taken away from them in a few days after they are born," one wrote.
The Elvie Brast pump is drawn from the Suss-buzz bridge inside the nursery bridge (Elvie/Metro)
Another comment, "The mother and child are suffering for both.
But why don't they be used for the broadcast of the Brest tapes that give them the opportunity to keep their children?"
And another added: "What is wrong with you?"
Other people protected the press, one of whom said that it was their song.
"I think it's a very good idea.
I had this too, if I was still smoking.
It's just that I'm feeling like a song from pinging.
This publication is not for sale, but I have seen it as it is.
One wrote that it is a good product."
And the other said, "This is a great talk for mothers who work (often in their place of work) and "gay."
It's not a promotion or a decision-making campaign."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they had been sneezing at their bra.
The background of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women say women who pry dance say they feel like they're a song.
Although the Elve paper is well hidden, there is no virus or tuberculosis, and the direct warning goes straight into a nursery bridge, allows women to walk, catch their children, and get out of here.
The ECD in A Bellerin, a participant and Mother commented: "The Elvv paper is a commercial product, which is the right of a producer and a wonderful launch.
We want to bring the dance ping and its challenges into the spot, showing the feeling of freedom in a funny and related way, which will bring the new page.
It's not the first time the Elve tape is in sorghums.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two producing children, designer Martha Jaquiboski, showed catwucking for her.
Hundreds of traveling children went to a tent camp at the border of Texas in secret
While there was no slight change in the monthly crossing of the border, there were some limitations because the heavy crews and nipples shown by the Trop administration have made it difficult for children to be assigned to users.
Naturally, most users had appointed themselves to travel without documentation and were afraid of endangering their own ability to live in the country by calling on any child.
The threat increased in June, when the Joint Authorities announced that potential users and other business or large members of the house would have to print their fingerprints and the data would be shared with foreign authorities again.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a prominent authority for travel and bordering clean conduct presented evidence to Congress that the Agency had arrested people who had requested to use unaccompanied Nabaligs.
Agensi later confirmed that 70 percent of the persons arrested have not previously had a military record.
"About 80 percent of those who are either users or members of the user's home live illegally in the country and most of them are criminals.
That's why we keep looking for these people," Mr. Albens said.
In order to prepare the children quickly, the authorities introduced a new law, which required that children be brought to court within a month of being arrested for 60 days, which was the previous standard according to escaped workers.
Many people are exposed by videoconferences to present their case personally in order to present their case to an alien judge.
Those who are considered incapable of being released will be removed immediately.
As long as children remain in custody, it is possible to stay behind or tired, which can be measured by the reports of security workers in recent months, according to the system's report.
The lawyers or teachers said that these cases are taken to a high level, where the sign that the child is fighting is being ignored because of their size.
They also said that taking children to town without giving them enough time to be emotionally prepared or to take them to the town of Tenth, where they are already fighting.
Syria urged military forces to return immediately to the United States, France, and Turkey
Speaking about the United Nations Summit, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mollem also told Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even when the war was now eight years old in the country.
The Ulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign soldiers are illegally on Syria's land and "they will be treated according to it."
"They should go back to war without any trace," they told Imbel.
The Wall stressed that in Syria, "the war is almost over" where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced out of their homes.
They said that Damascus would continue to fight this war until we would clear all Syrian territories of both the ethnic groups and the "Some stranger".
The United Kingdom has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly to train and advise both the Persians and the Syrian military forces against Al-Bassad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the country that was destroyed because of the war.
In the case of refugees, Mölm said the situation was right for them to return, and they assigned "some Western countries" to "fashion the poor", who sent the refugees away.
They said, "We have called international community and human organizations to facilitate this return."
"They've been taking full control of human affairs."
The United Kingdom and the European Union warned that there would be no help to rebuild Syria until there was no political agreement between the absence and the disparity between the end of the war.
United Kingdom politicians say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to put an end to the rebellion of the last president of Idlib makes it an opportunity to press on a political conversation.
The Russian-Turkey Dil or the agreement has stopped a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the country, where three million people lived.
Although, he said, there is a clear time limit in the agreement, and the hope is that military action will mark the wars of Al-Qaeda together with the armed forces that will be "destroyed."
The representative of the United Kingdom immediately hopes to organize a first meeting with the government and the members of the opposition to prepare the post-war system to correct Syria and the election path.
The Mölm had some restrictions on the participation of the Syrian government, which said that "to examine the articles of the current system" and to warn against hand-helds should be banned.

In the course of the elegance house, a strong middle - aged man came to pay for his expenses
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania had reached the end of the 17th century of money or a plan, which was to be rebuilt by the Prime Congress, which led to two presidential elections to run the same seat.
He recently opened the door for the National Rap Connor Long of the Sub-Saharan Pittsburgh, who won their seat in another election in the past year.
Lamp was also involved in another race, Republican Kat Rothofs, currently representing the 12ths of old Pennsylvania, which covers the new 17th century.
After this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of Justice in January, a map or maps were re-designed in the case of unofficially browsing on the part of the Republican side of the old streets.
In the 17th run, the struggle between the main weapons, the DCCC and the National Republican Association (NCRC) was the result of an empty hand struggle between the main weapons, the DCCC and the NRCC.
The 18th Congress of Pennsylvania, which was widely seen in the special election of March of March, has become widely known as Long after victory in Pennsylvania.
For this reason, there was a Republican coup for about a decade, and President Donald Trup won the war on that seat by 20 points.

Persecuting El Salvador to support the United States of America
The politicians stated that Dominican Republic and Panama had already approved vegetation because of opposition by Washington.
Mr. Tromp met with Panama's president, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trup Organization Management Team expelled the participants.
At the beginning of this month, the head of the department, H. Nort, said in a speech, "The decision that Taiwan is currently not authorized," decided to call back the US leaders of the coalition mission Al Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was sentenced, who received $140 million in US aid, with Narcotics control, development and financial assistance in 2017.
The proposed punishment, which included observing economic and social barriers to economic assistance, will be harmful to the Central American country and its high levels of malnutrition and death.
When progress was made at internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American authorities set up a high-level conference focusing on security and economic development, which was seen as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from leaving the United Nations from leaving.
But by mid-September, the Head of State explained that they wanted the conference to continue and to end effectively by considering any punishment or crime for El Salvador.
The politicians said that Sub-State President Mike Pence is now ready to comment on the conference, which is now scheduled to be held in mid-October.
And they returned to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominic kingdom, without a word or message from the three American Washingtons.
The White House user for Mr. Bolton, with two politicians, refused to comment on the description of the budget or the debate described by the three American authorities, which agreed to discuss the internal debate on a non-explainable basis.

And according to Mr. Müeller's report, they change the direction of their investigation that if Mr. Tromp's agency attacks Russia to attack our elections.
When Congress finds out, Mrs. Tromps finds themselves in the issue, when they prepare themselves to go to the councils again, perhaps in front of a jury of their colleagues.
Of course, much if and I mean not to suggest that Mr. Tromp's or not in Europe's context is not in vain.

Around such different points, the system of historical centre points and the anonymous market of the public is quickly or late.
The Americans now have to face a number of different points.
If Mr. Tromp Deft Atorni General Rod Rocentin, who controls the final results of Mr. Moyer's investigation, what will we do?
Rosentin has been involved in this debate since last year when this paper reported it, they have suggested that they keep a secret record of the state owner and consider their inability to do so for the office.
Mr. Rosentin said the timing account is not true.
"If the recently requested Brit Kwango's F.B.I. is not complete or impartial - or if he remains firm in the highest court despite John's testimony and false testimony, how will we react?
And above all, will we contribute in the meantime to Congress, for which Mrs. Tromps will be responsible?

"This was a good thing for us because Willary was good," said 31-year-old.

The Padistan publishers are surprised that the reader will not add it to his own thoughts and desires, he learns from a new letter
The book, which was created after the book was accepted, says: "It's hard to think of someone's place before it's published for the first time.
It's amazing to know about Pington's success."
Speaking of his father, who had been sent from a small village and had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a book to a child, he was hoping to accept his work, he said that in the 60th anniversary of the publication of their book, there were two "good and bad" in the 60th anniversary of his death.
About Paddington, which he describes as "his important member of his family", he says his father was proud of his potential success.
"He was a peaceful man and he was not very proud," he said.
"But since Pington was very real to them, it was almost like you had a child who's getting what he's got. You're proud of them, but you're not actually doing it.
I think they've seen the success of Paddington like that.
Even though it was their imagination and design, they always gave it to Paddington.

I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
To break his heart, the doctors who had given him drugs were slowly leaving his system.
He was dead some time before, and it was all closed.

I had to handle everything."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Lauprus, who suffered the loss of his daughter, was on a plane with other passengers — who were unaware of the situation they were in.

Postcards for women who are suffering from suicide on the ground
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to death, will be able to save others from their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kali Hungry put cards and phone numbers on the Welsh pole with moving messages that people can call for help.

He said, “Their death was a long time for him, and they were to go out from him,” and he kept his family away.
It hurt us.
But we all had to go ahead and fight."

At the beginning of the FBI's investigation, Kwanga's future appeared on the ground
"I think, if I can actually find something that he's looking for -- a limited time and a limited time check -- maybe we'll get a little unity," said Mr. Fleck on Saturday, and also that they're afraid that the group between the underprivileged gridlocks is breaking."
Why did Mr. Kwangua and their Republican supporters want the FBI?
It was because of their bad weather.
The Middle East elections were only five weeks away, and on November 6, as expected, the Republicans show very bad, so they will be severely weakened in their efforts in the highest courts on earth.
George Dblewu calls to call the Senator, preach to support Mr. Kwangua, who worked for Mrs. Bush in White House and meet with his wife, Ashley, who was a true or a secretist of Sir Bush.
What happened after the FBI presented its report?
There will be a medal in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 ethnic groups are currently in attendance.
It is not clear that Mr. Kwangua could have at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would have completed it and confirmed it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea has been hit by the fall of forests.
In South Korea, North Korea was reduced to seven years ago when it came to Jon-un's seventh, a South Korean administrator said.
In the wake of the South's integration ministry, Park Beyong-Syog said that 1,127 people have left their jobs in 2011 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said, "The highest levels were the highest levels of power between North Korea and China.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A large number of villages from the north end up in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally bordered since the end of the Korean war since 1953.
The largest part of China, whose border is the longest with North Korea and is easy to cross the protected area (DMZ) between two Korea.
China believes that refugees are illegal travelers rather than refugees, and often they are forced to return to their homeland.
The relationship between the north and the south - which is still technically in the state of war - has been improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of both countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on independent dialogue.
In June, U.S. President Donald Tramp and Kim Jon-On were activated after a historic meeting between Singapore, when they expressed broad agreement on the opportunities to work for the Free Korean Movement.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign Prime Minister Rei Yang-ho blamed the US for the decline in progress.

Nancy Pelory told Brit Kwangua, they said he's not eligible for the Supreme Court.
Houss Alummat President Nancy Pelosi told Brit Kwangua, hoping for the Supreme Court, and said that he was reluctant to act in the Supreme Court.
Palosi commented on Saturday in a witness in Texas in Austin, Texas, Texas.
"I can't think that a woman can do such a show, they call it "good," and Pelocy said to the Witnesses of Kwangua in front of the Senate Court.
Kwangua reportedly denied complaints that they had ever searched for John of the Dr. Christine Blassy Ford when they were two young people.
In his opening speech, Kavangua was very sensitive, sometimes complaining and interrupting about his family and school years.
They clearly persecuted Democrats against the community, which was angry at the 2016 Hilary Client's presidential election.
He said that he felt that the Witnesses of Kwangoa had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he knew that he was against democracy.
"I think they've made themselves out of these stories and the same way they came to Clinton and Democrat," he said.
Pelocy doubted whether this question would be answered if Kwangua was standing and if the Democrats were to be held in the meeting, whether he would still be guilty of Kwangoa.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not right for the Supreme Court, but he can work now because he's invited," said Pelocy.
Kwangua is currently a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelocy said that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible rules of Kwangua against the effective management of the Act or Ro V.Wed, because they are going to be judged as rebels.
In the course of his approval, Kwangoa stopped questions about whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"In hearing of his testimony, Kwanga has stopped questions about whether he will reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
And women need to wash it.
It is a righteous thing to wait, and the anger of the moon and of the years to come; but they can't restrain themselves from weeping.
Sister Stemin told me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
They were saying, "A woman has helped me with a great deal of help from an official who said that when he gets angry, he cries, but he has developed a new technique, which means that when he gets angry and he starts to cry, the person he was talking to will say to him, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then they were talking.
