Welsh AMs are worried that they'll be ‘astonishing’
They interviewed others among the AMs in the view of changing their so-called MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This will be removed from the program for the change in the call of the Welsh Parliament.
The Ams of all political parties have the hope that this will call them a joke.
Another aspect of the labour AM is that they were afraid because there is a sound similar to that of Twp and Pwp.
For foreign students of Wales: According to this Welsh twp, twp means seed and pwp means seed.
The level of Plaid AM is similar to that of a group that has never given other names that are optional.
About the Welsh Conservative she said as a group they were willing to accept a change of name but noted that the MWP is very close to the so - called explosive.
The entire Welsh W element is also called U in Yorkshire England.
This conference is the first to reject the change of the name: "The decisive decision by which the so-called legislator is to be a matter for which the members of the parliament are not. "
The law of the Welsh Government Act 2017 granted the Welsh organisation the right to change their name.
In June the Communist Party published the results of public opinion, which had received great support for the resurgence of an organization called the Welsh parliament.
In the case of the AMS, the company has set up a WMP and its public opinion has expressed its reliance on MWP.
The Ams have put forward their views, but this question will be a problem with Elin Jones, who should not be subjected to the violation of the change law in the next weeks.
The reverse rules will include changes in how the interface works, including AM corrections and codification rules.
The AMs will have the last word in the case that they will be called after the legal discussion.

There is a lack of information on problems such as human rights, freedom of citizens and Turkey’s EU exit.
Erdogan will move from Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to many grieving people in Turkey outside of Turkey.
The security police have prevented more than 25,000 people from standing in front of the mosque, but many of the refugees are not able to see their president.
Thousands of non-Erdogan-many of them are Kurdish- and they want us to hear their words, understand Erdogan's law and the German government now accept them to the country.
The report reveals a distinction between the views of the apparent visitor to the German Turks and as opposed to others.

The controversy comes from the HMP Long Larsin in Worcestershire in 09;30 BST on Sunday and continues.

Six workers must be trained.
We don't want to put you in prison, and we want to make it clear that those who are involved are sent to the police and spent the rest of the time."
HMP Long Lardin is a prisoner of more than 500, sometimes counting dangerous funeral customs.
However, the prisoner was reported to have received treatment after being arrested by the prisoner.
And last year the prison staff who helped when they were released were called to help with this disturbing situation when the workers were attacked by a bomb.
The Rosa storm attacks Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City along with the floods (Sympathies will be affected)
It is not uncommon for a revolution to attack Arizona, but what will happen early in the week as Huricane Rosa’s strength continues to draw closer to the far east, bringing floods.
The heavenly voices will issue a warning that you will avoid the floods of the Middle East and the Second in West Arizona to the south as well as east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa looks forward to taking the road over Phoenix on Tuesday, after Christmas and rain.
Heavenly voices in Phoenix said to Twitter’s message: “The last ten shifts are only 200 miles [200 km] in Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm over 40 miles [40 km] and south of AZ."
The National Hurricane Center stands from 2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 cm] wide, corresponding to these 6 cm [6 cm] in Mogollan Rim in Arizona.
In some parts of the desert in the south-west, the Rockies community and the Great Basin are expected to get 1 to 2, as complete as they are measured at 4 cm if possible.
With the dangers of these floods, Rosa is not a good blessing as part of the attack by the storm.
Or if floods are too dangerous, one of the rain will be a reward because in the West they are attacked by drought.
According to U.S. Drogth Monitor (see below), 40 percent of Arizona’s problem is reported, in two major cases in the list, weather.com reported.
First, the storm passes Rosa before Baja California penisula of Mexico.
Rosa, the Sun - powered sun - powered Sunday morning as it travels at a speed of 85 miles per hour [85 km / hr], 385 miles [285 km / hr] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and rises north at a speed of 12 miles per hour [12 km / hr].
The storm approaches the Pacific and thus waits for its power to fall.
Therefore, we are expected to flee to Mexico as a hot, strong winter or in the Middle East.
The rain in hundreds of areas in Mexico may be large, causing flooding.
The rain is from 3 to 6 inches [3 to 6 cm] of Baja California to the north-west of Sonara, and the 10 centimetres can be seen,"weather.com reported.
Rosa will still climb north as an exit before arriving on the Arizona road in the early morning, passing through Arizona and then into the southern Utah at nighttime on the second.
The expected great danger that Rosa has or has left the strong rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonara, and U.S. Southwest, " said National Hurricane Cente.r.
These rainwaters are expected to produce life - sustaining streams and streams that flow into the banks, as well as high mountains.

Trump says Kavanaugh is ‘bad, cruel, hatred’ by Democratic Party
"Jaji's vote Kavanaugh votes to cast off the painless and disgruntled experts at the Democratic Party," said Trump at the Wheeling meeting, West Virginia.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "died, anger" of the Democratic Party in all his promotional process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, in opposition to the violence from Christine Blasey Ford that he had been brutally attacked decades ago when he was younger.
Ford also witnessed on the side of his peers.
The Mengamele says that Kavanaugh's "people of America's culture and courage" ended that day.
"Volt to ensure that Jaji Kavanaugh votes to ensure one of the most effective legal ideas in our time, a lawyer with a lot of public service history," he told a group of West Virginia people.
The president said that Kavanaugh’s rise in the time he spoke of the importance of the Republican arrival in the internal elections.
Five weeks from one of our most important choices in life.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That is why I will fight every place of the faithful leaders."

Hundreds died from earthquakes, tsunamis, and earthquakes
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed by heavy rains during a bus attack, while tsunamis hit the Indonesian coast of Sulawesi, according to officials.
Hundreds of people joined in a march in the city of Palu on Friday when the gases rose 18 meters high and attacked at the airport in the first half hour, killing many of them on their deathbed and destroying anything on the way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 meters.
"When the tsunami threat came on Thursday, people did their jobs in private and did not rush and become victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who speaks Indonesia, in the disaster attack on BNPB.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, drove cars, boats, houses, and threw everything into the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami would blow up the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before flying in the world.
Some men went to the mountains to flee from Tsunami, saying,
Some 17,700 people were moved to 24 buildings in Palu.
The photos taken from the disaster center showed many buildings and shops, brick bridges, and airplanes, along with a pool surrounded by water.
The effort has continued to move the city into the valley all the way to the end.
The earthquake was known in 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) says that the magnitude of the damage caused on Friday was 200 percent of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, sitting at the end of the long, small part, may increase the size of tsunamis, saying.
Nugroho described such damage as "big" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels were destroyed.
Other victims were found locked under the roof of destroyed buildings, he said, adding 540 people to their deaths and 29 died.
Nugroho tells those who suffer and the damage may be larger than 300 miles [300 km] north of Palu, a place called Donggala, near the quake epicenter.
The connection "unconsciously confused" is from Dodhea, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, " Says the Red Cross in the camp, adding that its employees and volunteers go to the affected areas.
It's said, "This is already painful, but I'm getting worse than this."
The findings were widely criticized for not saying that tsunami attacked Palu, although the authorities said that the water arrived at that time the warning was being issued.
a video shared in social society by a man under the building may shout indiscriminately warning of tsunami approaching people on the street below.
For a few minutes, the seawater wall, which removes buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not verify the video reality immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the end of the energy and communication in Palu to make it difficult for managers to direct aid efforts.
Soldiers have started sending aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, meaning authorities, but survivors need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only opened aid efforts and will be created until October.
President Joko Widododo was scheduled to visit the holiday centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia Tsunami Toll is over 800.
It's too bad.
When workers from the World Vision have settled in a safe place in Palu, where workers live in shelters built at their office headquarters, transporting drugs on the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief teams began to launch relief teams, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were forbidden to go to Palu.
According to the Indonesian guidelines, the funds, goods, and workers from the past can begin to fall if the disaster is called the global disaster zone.
That is impossible.
"It's just a state disaster," says Aulia Ariani, who speaks Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government said, "That's right, this is a global disaster," we can't afford assistance from other countries but it's still not possible."
As the second night falls to Palu after the earthquake of the fifth century and tsunamis, friends and family of those still alive hoped that lovers would be miracles of natural disasters.
In the end, the little boy was released from prison.
On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been locked under the blanket for two days and her mother’s body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian disabled trainer, trained two disabled people who had lost their lives in Asian games, which were originally assembled in Indonesia this month.
Some of those who were trapped in Roa Roa Roa’s hotel, said Mr. Mandia, were his disciples.
He says, "As an elder in the field of those who are sick, I have a feeling of responsibility.
Miss Gendon explained that, in the hours following Roa Roa Roa Hotel's news from within the paragliding community, he had sent messages of WhatsApp to the Palu competition, which was part of the beach army.
His instructions, but, in turn, made a single mark, instead of looking at the blue lines of the sky.
"I think that means that messages are not sent," he said.

One West: he changed his name to Ye.
Lieutenant Kanye West changed his name--that's Yes.
Advertised on Twitter at the end, he wrote: "You are known as Once."

Mexico's AMLOs do not want to use war against civilians
Mexico's president chosen by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will not use the army against civilians as the country nears 50 years of blood assault against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use soldiers to oppress the people of Mexico."
Police were targeted at a peaceful exhibition on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time when the spread of Latvian students focused on Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support new Mexicans by providing all the disasters to those who read and open many public universities.
He says that unemployment and the lack of opportunities to learn lead youths to crime.
The U.S. must support A.I.
As China operates more in I.A., the U.S. should double the number used for research in the field, says a financial producer and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments from the various parts of the U.S. government have made a statement to AI, as the U.S. general does not have an AI.
During that time, China began its program last year: it intends to number 1.1 to AI in 2030.
"The cost of AI research will be a good start, because all other countries are too far behind the U.S., and we want the next success of AI," Lee said.
Controversy with financial support can be repeated once and for all because of the major U.S. AI performance, Lee has led the CNBC to discuss this church.
Lee, his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, Director of the Innovation Ventures, who was raised in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University worked on the new AI program of the American Othello player, and later became the director of the Microsoft Research and Director of the Google branch of China
Lee agreed to the U.S. professional competition as the Eastern Robotics Challenge Highway and asked if the next one would be, to help see the next industries.
U.S. researchers should often work hard to overcome government benefits, Lee says.
"There is no China that removes educational leaders; they are companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies use version-based lighting to work on AI years later.
Lee said that changes in the goals of the transition could also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think the green cards should be automatically performed on PhDs in AI," he says.
China's Forum for the Development of the Next Generation Intelligence Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
China National Natural Science Foundation spends money on people in educational institutions such as the Nonla Science Foundation and others that spend money on researchers, but the level of teaching is small in China, says Lee.
The Defense Department is the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which has to be associated with the management of the field as well as the teachers, and the White House announces the construction of a special committee of the Artificial Intelligence.
This month the DARPA represents $2 billion in the AI Next program.
NSF, I grew up to $100 million a year in AI research.
Until then, the U.S. National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence is still under age.
Macedonians vote for whether or not they change the name of the world.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday that they would turn the name of the country into "Republic of North Macedonia," a campaign that will resolve the conflict with Greece on the basis of the European Union's equality with NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its territory, continues to say that their neighbors in the north of their way want their place and want to enter NATO and the EU.
Both governments make agreement with the name mentioned, but some say that changing the name means looking down on the customs of most Macedonians is Slavic
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote and that the refusal to vote would give the impression that 50 percent of the people would come to the council.
The question on the vote paper reads: "You agree with NATO's membership with the EU through the Greek agreement."
In agreement with the change of name, Count Zoran Zaev, says that what you are currently paying for is the EU and Nato in Macedonia, other countries that have experienced the collapse of Yugoslavia
"I am ready to vote for our country, so that young Macedonians will live well under the European Union's threshold because it describes all our health," says Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Regardless of the legal basis, the majority of the parliaments will accept the vote.
The adjustment will require two - thirds of a district convention.
The world voting committee says there are no reports of non-compliance at 1 p.m.
However, it is still 16 per cent, more than 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary vote in 2016, while 66 per cent of the voters voted in favour of their votes.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the city, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia by changing the name of the country that will open the way for joining NATO with the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
During the assembly in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing the hall and sitting before the tents of those who would face the referendum.
"We don't have NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads, not by the service door," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary growth in Macedonia, with more than 20 per cent unemployed.
"I believe that 80 percent of our citizens will cry with the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He says "yes" the results "a guarantee of our future."
The poll published in Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters to participate – under expectations.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57 per cent of the respondents who organized the Sunday vote.
Otherwise, 70 percent say your vote.
In order for the Ephraimites to be responsible for the poor to be 50 percent and one vote.
A failure of the pherendum will present a major problem of the pro-Western government this took a long time on May one year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crossing the bridge of all Brighton survivors to escape
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the Bridge of Brighton in the battle of Manchester City on 2-0 win at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy in his 65 - minute article.
Argentine’s player was beaten in the back of the chair at the beginning of the program.
He was among three Brighton prisoners, before the court was brought to trial.
Aguero is surrounded by four green beds.
You press one of the keys before you cross a box in the Brighton box.
Then he cries out to the north, finding Sterling.
The front ring directly affects the ball in the box to return it back to Aguero, who uses his right arm to defeat the Brighton tree by Matthew Ryan on the north side of the net.
"Aguero still faces problems on his feet," the city manager Pep Gardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him about 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
But it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues an opportunity at the beginning of the Premiere League dispute.
The ball fell in 29 minutes.
Ague_r will find the ball in the direction of the Brighton player in the game.
You send a nice ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane said to touch it before sending Sterling into the palace.
Sky Blues players touched the ball and entered the tree almost came out.
The city competes with Hoffenheim at the Champions League in the game to play at 122:55 on Tuesday at Rhine-Necker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Schherzer wants to play with the sponsor. And Rockies
The National Group has been transferred to the playoff competition, and there is no reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who is looking for a challenge, wants to come into court on Sunday with Colorado Rockies, which is probably the only way if Rockies is facing problems with playoffs, he won only one game by leading Los Angeles Dodgers to the West and NL.
Rockies has a single wild-card voice by winning 5-2 when they're already facing the Nationals on Friday, but they're looking forward to holding their first round of the first division.
"But we don't have anything to play, which is that if we come to the position of the Danver followers and this one group will be playing the biggest game I've ever faced this year.
What made me not want to play there?"
The Nationals are not going to play on Sundays, but it seems as if they can let Scherzer go into this movement.
Scherzer, who may be 34 years old, has a bullpen flag on Thursday and will be spending his rest on Sunday.
The Washington's right-hand dealer has 2.53 ERAs and 220 strakeouts with 2/3 intensities in this case.
Trump announces West Virginia
The president gave his speech on the situation surrounding his election by Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court when he stressed the importance of the republican exit and the internal and civil elections.
"All we've done at the station in November.
Five weeks before the most important choice in our health.
This is one of the great ones, mostly -- I don't know, but you can say I'm running so I'm going everywhere to fight a powerful soldier," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this very, very interesting group of Democrats, which you see as it is now.
And they are determined to return to the hand of any means they can get, eat, and defile.
But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! and to them that give suck, in those days!
Democrats, he said, are in the campaign "to oppose and disrupt."
"Even if you look at the past four days," he said, who called the Democrats "unclean, unclean, unclean and not true."
He then referred to the Senate Legal Committee called Sen. Diane Feinstein, a Democrat by name, who brought water to the masses.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you save the document?
Hey, hey, this is it.
No, for them, I said that his stand alone didn't tell me the stories I've never seen a person stand so rich to him."
The Working Group is no longer the congregation of any individual.
They do not talk about what they have in mind.
When Momentum helmets in our group voted to close my mouth, I was not surprised.
But of course, I'm not late for the MP's team meeting that is told they're not welcome -- just because of what we think.
Our Polish brother Joan Ryan has received nearly the same treatment because of opposition to Semitics.
In my case, those who wanted to keep my mouth accused me of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the light of the importance of the financial system, national security, Europe, and other wonderful things Jeremiah has associated with other leaders before.
In a group of Nottingham East employees at the Fifth Meeting, we say "we need meetings without going over and benefit them."
Almost every eight years I'm a MP of our working group, the GC meetings of the Fifth Day have always been.
Unfortunately today, it does not go as ordinary meetings and the promise of a "sensitive, mild" policy has long been forgotten if, indeed, we have ever existed.
It will be more clear that different views are no longer acceptable to the Working Group and that opinions were judged as acceptable to the leaders of the group.
This was just after Jeremy became leader, and my brothers and sisters said that we had the same political views as they had seen that I often took sides that I would not agree with — whether national security or the EU’s child market.
Whatever I talk about in society is not important and I say that I’m going to get a gas of abuse from the media that says I’m fired, it’s going to end up politics, and I’m not supposed to be in the Working Group.
And we are not alone in dealing with this.
Anyway, I know I'm worse than ours because the speeches about mine still like politics.
I am surprised that our brothers are not involved in their work and their determination to remain neutral despite sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the greatest reminders of this political era is how cruel levels seem to be.
Jeremy Corbyn said that last week the Labor party must set a standard of boundaries.
The truth is that we are no longer the great and untrustworthy church or the changing laws of the sect is going to decline.
I had many advice for the last two years that I was asked to do something about myself, don't talk too much, and it's going to be "I'm good."
But there is nothing that I can do about politics.
Once I met Labour 32 years ago as a student, I was strongly opposed by the Thatcher government by leaving school rooms on the ground, wanting to bring the best public services to those who need them most — perhaps as a local government or as a government governor.
I have never been involved in politics, including in the final election.
No one in the Nottingham East can be confused about the law of the state of the amia and the areas of the current competition.
To those who encourage you to travel on Friday, all I can say is that when the world moves forward in Brexit that will make it easier for family, business, and our public service, I don’t want to spend my time and energy faithfully with the leader of the Labor party.
But indeed, another message I have never heard from the Nottingham Momentum, which is difficult, may be members of the Labor or not: I train myself to serve you and I promise there will be no threat or politics that will prevent me from doing what I believe will be best for all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Air that never was separated from the seat above
The two recent tries have reduced the final results, but it cannot be condemned Ayr deserves to be praised in this modern game as the most beautiful of Tenent's Premiership.
Now they are superior, indeed on the side of the ten that cannot be separated.
Finally, their defense, whenever possible, will be left at home with the trainer Peter Murchie has every reason to be happy.
He says, "We've been tested all our games so far, and we've never been separated, so I have to be happy."
And Robyn Christie, who was from Melrose, said, "Glory to Ayr, make use of every opportunity beyond us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute drive is set up by Frazier Climo, leading to Ayr, but, cap Rory Hughes of the Socketland, was released from the Warriors game, so Melrose made himself a team and Jason Baggot examined all the tricks.
The climate in Ayr went forward with pennade, just before, to the first round, put the solo try to make 17-5 at Ayr on a break.
But Melrose on the second floor started well and Patrick Anderson's trick, put by Baggot, reduced the tire by five points.
Then there was a time-consuming resulting from the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was released without delay, if they came from and Ayr was able to move forward through the steps of Stafford McDowell, imposed by Climo.
The Ayr's front cap is then given a soft card, and, Melrose is very proud of Bruce Colvine's trick, at last powerful.
The housekeepers returned, or so, and when Struan Hutchinson found a glass of water after clearing the cloudless climate, outside of the pennade line, MacPherson hung on the roof of Ayr.
Climo put, as he did at first, after Kyle Rowe met a football star named David Armstrong who sent this David Armstrong to the side of the house on the fifth floor.
Game star shows its health in the food stores
The Game star Ford Kieran seems to delay the transfer of food after finding that it is declared to be the official director of the food company.
Jack Jarvis, 56 years old in the BBC, wrote and became a careful speech as well as Greek Hemphil.
Doo claims that the next half-year cycle will be the last point in the program, and Kiernan seems to be moving after Craiglang.

The actor refused to comment on the matter, but the Scottish Sun source points out that Kiernan sees it as part of Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."
'the sea is ours': Bolivian authorities hope that the court will open the path of the Pacific
Drivers in La Paz wore the ring-clad head and tail.
The spacecraft raise the ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have the following insight: "The sea is ours to the right
Correction is our job.
In all areas of Bolivia, the costline memory lost in Chile in the 19th century the source is still clear – as it wishes to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes may well exceed your years, Bolivia expects the world’s judicial system to be executed on October 1st after five years.
"Bolivia has Power, a spirit of unity and humility, and in fact hopes for a red effect," says Roberto Calzadilla, who is legally speaking Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will look at the ICJ rulling on major screens everywhere, with the strong hope that the Hague court will plant Bolivia’s flag that – after decades of speech – Chile is forced to negotiate by allowing Bolivia to control part of the sea.
Evo Morales, the appropriate Bolivian president – who is facing long-term dialogue over the coming year – has many of us living in the Middle East.
"we are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
But some critics believe that a small court would allow Bolivia - and that name would change if it agreed.
The Netherlands-supported UN team has the power to designate Chile's areas, insists that the success of the talks will not be resolved.
That the ICJ rullings only came in six months after the issues were heard to be "hard enough," said the Chilean international lawyer, Paz Zárate.
It also prevents Bolivia’s objectives from being achieved, four years ago it may have been delayed.
"The issue of permission to use the sea has been denied to Bolivia's authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' speech that fosters the disintegration of Chilean cooperation, put it this way.
Bolivia and Chile will soon continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to continue talking to each other after this.
Two countries that have not changed so quickly since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian lawyer in Hague, has ruled that the court is too quick to make a decision.
The Middle East will bring Bolivia "the first unique opportunity to establish a new time of contact with Chile" and the opportunity "to establish 139 years of disagreement with the interests of the two countries", he said.
Calzidilla also denies that Morales – one of the famous presidents in Latin America – used the sea as a political basis.
"Bolivia will never abandon its commitment to the use of the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is a chance that it seems we need a victory that has passed."
North Korea claims that the cessation of nuclear weapons will not happen unless it can hope for America.
North Korean foreign government Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop fighting with nuclear weapons first unless they trust Washington.

She told the United States that she was following her promises made at the Singapore conference that she was among the leaders of the country.
His observations were until the time of America. World writer Mike Pompeo looked at the first nuclear accident three months after Singapore and Kim Jon Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's an impossible dream that the continued U.S. defeat and refusal of the Korean war ceases to cause North Korea to collapse.
Washington realized that he did not consent to make the announcements Pyongyang has not begun to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. /American President Donald Trump need a second conference.
But there can be a lack of doubt that Pyongyang is determined to abandon the world that may look like the only safe way to escape.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim and Trump conference.
The Paris façade is a large number of clothes that come to stores near you
If you want to expand the list of your clothes or to keep the sun out completely, you will not be able to look far away.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a list of major hairdressers on their SS19 floor at a Paris Fashion Week exhibition.
Unbelieving clothing is filled with Instagram in this type, and the performers bring eye - catching scenes.
The remains of Valentino were long on the sides of a six - sided truck with a rope and a seat that was to be held by the head of the head of the head of the head.
Some of the great gems include precious gems, a central head.
Thom Browne showed unusual faces in Halloween time.
Most of the cover-up objects in the mouth look like Hannibal Lecter rather than something built by the front-liners.
Another structure is similar to the waterproofing clothing that has air and doors.
If you continue with a famous fascist, you can put yourself in the band.
Watchers notice that large coats may be on the way to large shops with stores of goods.
The main heading follows closely The 'La Bomba', a common two-footed head opening from this sunset, visible from Rihanna's "every" to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of an untrustworthy head famous on the contact pages sends other items to the sea view almost equal to the size of a sailor.
A soft wooden box with a fragrant wood, was covered with silver, covered with white skin on the beach, traveling alone at the exhibition of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in the Paris exhibition.

John Edward: Agriculture skills are important to women.
Schools in Scotland maintain details of good results, and this continued in 2018 with some good results, which are guaranteed only by the success of one person and their sports, art, music, and other public efforts.
With an impressive number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these schools are required by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to bringing divine help.
Schools to prepare students to enter high school entrances, as well as to selected fields and places as citizens in the country.
Like the educational door that can be arranged and started with a special education program, we see that today’s crops continue to be a popular and popular field as a school - chosen education.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a voice that he hears, what he says goes straight to his head."
If he speaks in his tongue, let this be for his heart.
This powerful reminder is that we would not rely on English if we wanted to build up relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s testing, we can see that the most outstanding crop in the wild is being produced at the most suitable schools.
Sixty-eight of all the students who learned foreign fields found the High Class A.
The subjects, collected in 17 schools and members of SCIS, suggest that seventy-two percent of students have received Higher Class A in Mandarin, as some seventy-two percent have learned German, sixty-nine percent have found those who have learned French and thirty-three percent have also learned Spanish.
This suggests that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills for children, young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
It is now the kind of education you can choose, and it is taken as the same as previous (science, technology, engineering, and statistics) in schools that need to be organized and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons why managers were unable to close ten and seven percent (17 per cent) were given to language skills.
In particular, language skills will be important in preparing young ones for work opportunities.
With a wide range of work ahead of the needs of languages, these skills are important in a united world.
No matter what level a person takes, if he learns a second level, they take the best chance at their early childhood to have the ability to do so.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign lands puts a person in a position to speak many languages ahead of those who are associated with them.
According to a YeuGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, some 17 (75) percent could not speak well of the foreign field and have a good conversation and only French is the birthplace of two percent, 15 (15) percent.
That is why the growth of agricultural education is important to children today.
If you have many familiar fields, especially those of developing countries, it will help to reduce children’s chances of getting a better job.
In Scotland, schools and schools vary in their teaching language.
Most of the schools focus mainly on the education of older and modern farmers, while others teach the most important crops in the UK in the year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there are many kinds of plants you can choose from at school, and you can control the ants in this area.
Schools in Scotland are committed to providing education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, in the long run.
Not to be overlooked in today’s business world is the fact that crops will continue to play a major role in the future of the world, so this is a subject of education.
In fact, modern plants must be included in "the global communication skills."
Schools for self - worth will continue to offer this opportunity, distinctions, and contrasts to young Scots.
You must do the right thing.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Libron will play his first game at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
It is nearing the end of waiting for followers to see Libron James play his first game of Los Angeles Lakes.
Coach Luke Walkon announced that James will play a week in the game to prepare for the beginning of the games, and they will play with dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
However, for the next few minutes, they will play it again.
"It will be more than one and less than twenty-eight," said Walton on the Lakers page.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell tells Twitter that James has many opportunities to play for minutes.
After the ceremony, James was asked about his program and the Lakers by six games he had played before he was upset.
"I don't need games to push myself from the top of my field to start playing" he said.
The Trup's West Virginia Rally Time car racing game is displayed in YouTube
President Donald Trump begins the campaign by train at night at Wheeling, West Virginia.
The first of the five rounds of Trump's voyages next week, including the establishment of the Tennessee and Mississippi border stations.
With the guarantee of a vote to close the court’s vote, Trump intends to build followers in this internal election as the Republicans are at risk of losing power on Monday.
The Trip's election trip in West Virginia, will you start at this time?
The Trip's election trip to Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at seven o'clock in the evening. ET at night, finally, 29 O'clock 2018.
You can see the Trip's selection route in West Virginia by entering YouTube to look at what's happening now.
Trump may have been accused of this church by a high court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was charged with court cases and the Senate vote pending as the FBI is investigating.
But the campaign’s goal is to help the Republicans find an interest in dealing with the elections.
Thus, President Trump in his campaign says this five-week drive plan "to give interest to volunteers and followers as the Republicans try to protect and increase the number of their citizens in the country," says Reuters.
"to control the atmosphere is important to the president's travel plan for many countries that cannot travel as fully as possible at the busy time of the campaign" contradicts the mouth of Trump's campaign to prevent Reuters from passing his name.
Organised by Wesbanco Arena es Wheeling, modern cars can bring passengers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh connections," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Finally, it will be the second two months that Trump visited West Virginia, a country that won over two percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virgin Republic Senate.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president tries to make her a single choice," said Simon Haeder, a political secretary at West Virginia University, according to Reuters report.
The Ryder's 2018 club The American team hopes to fight and maintain the hopes of a single day's games on Sunday.
After the three side meetings, on Saturday afternoon, these Ryder Cup games may have to be repeated four times.
The game is a fully-fledged game scheme but not a match for players who believe in it.
So where would they be now?
"They're headed for six points and now they're young, so we're going on as if by little power I think" said Jordan Spieth as they drive a little in the day.
Europe has opportunities, indeed, four points ahead of twenty.
Americans, as Spieth says, can be happy little and many can be encouraged, not by Spieth and Justin Thomas who play with each other every day and only three points a day.
Spieth was always dangerous and led by example.
Those who watched were so happy when she was, patiently playing the golf is important to balance the game when she and Thomas left each other together.
His golfer won the game with 15 similar joys, which he urges you to believe that the American team is not coming out.
"You're really going to have to be deep and worried about your own game," said Speth.
It is as if one of them is already a member of the Governing Body.
18 nodes to mark.
Only one of the most influential players than Spieth and Thomas two days ago were those Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, not questioned at this Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but the competition that makes it very much and is determined.
"Moliwood" were the only ones who wouldn't start bogey on Saturday morning, but they avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday and Friday morning.
This race, in the same way as the two of them are strong from this fierce denial that they conclude that they are the winning players on Sunday, and there will be no known players who will be interested in winning Europeans as the sun dies Le Golf National rather than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The two types of balls are not the same
The talk about glory in Europe has not changed, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, who got in the morning for fourballs, when Alex Noren was arrested.
Both Bogey and the former doubles left the long Spanish and Swedish strands they would never have.
On Sunday, no one will help you out of your village.
Fourballs and foursomes enjoy looking close to each other because of cooperation between the brains, the advice they offer, the advice not to give, and how an island can change rapidly.
Europe plays well as a group and eventually leads, but the foursomes have shown that the United States still had the power to continue, by choosing the States, to question.
Europe takes 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a great deal of confidence on the last day of the Ryder Cup after fourballs and foursomes on Saturday at 10-6 p.m. in the United States.
Two Tommy Fleetwoods and Francesco Molinari won twice more than a tough Tiger Woods presentation on four points in the Gulf National.
On the other side of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, to be determined to capture the puzzle they had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, to fail America in the fourballs of the box, setting a range of 3--1.
The U.S. is a tough and powerful game, winning two games, but it won't stop the players.
Jim Furyk, on the other hand, needs nine points left in 12 Sundays to keep the track.
Fleetwood is the first European to gain ideas in line with the time he himself was Molinari, he called it "Molliwood" after a good weekend that won four points in their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
By separating Woods and Patrick Reed from fourballs, they then sprayed up the Woods and Bryson Dechambeau of America at 5&4.
Woods, who entered two final games, showed great determination but he now lost 19 games of 29 fourballs and foursomes.
Justin Rose, who lives in the morning's fourballs, returned Henrik Stanson to the forums by 2&1 to separate Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third world.
And they are determined to return to the hand of any means they can get, eat, and defile.
Jordan Spieth and Justini were three times as angry and divided the Americans into three points on the Final.
They gained 2&1 by dividing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain into fourballs and then separated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in foursomes while playing two open balls.
In the history of Ryder Cup only two times if the team comes from four points to each game, on the other hand, Furyk needs only to measure to protect the rope.
After doing better for two days, or so, the attack on the Church seems to break them apart.
North Korea says 'no' does not wear out without trust.
The North Korean foreign government told the United Nations of the outcome that it would continue to deepen its disloyalty to the United States and that it would not be possible for the world to disarm nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's body the General Assembly that North Korea has done "recovery" last year, such as preventing nuclear and testing nuclear weapons, eliminating nuclear sites, and promising not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
And he says, "But yet, we don't see the answer from the U.S.."
"Untrustful U.S. will have no hope of protection in the world, and under this situation there is no way we can take advantage of it first."
While Ri disagrees with the North Korean approach on the rejection of Washington "by the class" of nuclear destruction while North Korea may be affected by action, the regime is a reflection of why we do not prevent nuclear destruction as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump first met with President U.S. President of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work at the "denuclearization of the Korean pensula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea.
North Korea was still trying to eliminate the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang should distribute nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"U.S. continues by "the end of the war" and highlights the levels of law pressure to achieve its purpose by force, and that it also rejects "the declaration of end of war" says Ri.
"To understand that the law can make us humble is the dream of people who care about us.
But the problem that progresses is that we are becoming increasingly distrustful.
Ri didn't open up any plans to reconnaissance between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader of the United States came from the weekend.
He has at least three meetings between Kim and South Korea Moon Jae-in's leader in the past five months and added: "If part of this issue of nuclear destruction in South Korea and not in the U.S., nuclear destruction in Korea will not result in this commitment."
Or so said, the hearing of Ri's speech was completely different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the U.S. was looking forward to the North Korea's rockets that took place after "Mr. Trump" called Kim "rocket man" in this regard.
In this year the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely end" North Korea, to raise Kim with her courage to take a firm step, but there is much to be done and the law remains until North Korea ends the drought.
On Wednesday, Trump says he doesn't have his entire time, he says, "If it takes two, three, or five years, it's okay."
Russia itself argues that the U.N. Security Council is in the process of replacing Pyongyang with measures taken.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: Security Council on Thursday said: "The security Council must go on and not fail until we see the end, completely, and evidence of the nuclear destruction."
Security Council has approved North Korea's support for breaking the law since 2006 in establishing the payment of taxes as well as the banistic miscellaneous regime of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri Bamba with the U.N. General Assembly and said that after all the relief they went to visit and Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second.
Pompeo has long visited North Korea three times this year, but his final trip is not good.
He left Pyongyang on July for the first time, in North Korea only by making it clear that he was "simply violent."
North Korea organizes a meeting with Moon this month to eliminate the location of the missile and the UN if the United States takes "the same steps."
He said Kim told me "the same steps" he wanted to strengthen security when Trump promised Singapore and caused a common relationship with Washington.
Harvard’s students have learned enough to help them grow up
A new course at Harvard University this year all those who don't have enough sleep to overcome the habit of doing research using caffeine 'all night.'
The educational levels have found many students in previous verses that they are worthless if they are known for their basics to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and at Brigham as well as Women's Hospital, started the course, the first of which was the U.S.
She was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk about how to sleep in reading.
The young lady came and said to me, "How is it that I am told this day, since I am a virgin?"
He said, "No one has ever told him about my sleep, and I'm surprised he's got a telegram.
Course was first printed this year, explaining to the students the importance of adequate sleep habits to help the card and to improve the quality of the day’s sleep.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, said a university decided to die the course after discovering that many students do not sleep well during the week.
The length of the study includes a series of steps taken.
The first part has a picture of the school room, when students choose coffee commissions, voters, trainers, and books about the effects of caffeine and the light on how self-sacrifice helps you sleep, as well as how to sleep.
On the other hand, participants are told that avoiding long - term sleep increases the chances of heart disease, tuberculosis, depression, and cancer.
The map of the compass, with helpful features, will encourage those who share in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not be late for the behavior of the disciples."
We believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke cigarettes,' he added Professor Czeisler.
The practice of 'dwelling up to' is what is done, that is, adding that modern technology and too much pressure on students reduces the level of problem sleep that goes into the city.
To ensure that you sleep sufficiently, sufficiently, must be a 'secret weapon' of the student to overcome stress, anxiety and anxiety, which says – even avoids pregnancy, as sleep gives attention to the situation of hunger, which makes them suffer.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to graduate, who studied in one of his classes during his first year in Harvard.
He offered the study to open his eyes and urged him to study it to the whole center.
The next step, of course, is to ask the high - ranking students to read in the same way as this study program before they join a competitive center.
Prof. Czeisler suggests that students should consider setting up alarms while sleeping, as well as getting up with you, and understanding the bad consequences of the ‘green light’ produced by the electric screens and LED light, which could produce from the environment, leading to the required levels.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The only time I'm getting older is Gerrard
The Rangers were organized and marched during the defeat of Dolly Menga, who attacked the uneven Steven Gerard, who fell down in 1 to 0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox intends to collect their first rounds since they won February 4.1 in St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team is responsible for Gerard's second division in 18 games as the manager who left his side behind for eight points from the leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership Hearts.
Try to attack in seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers players endure without beating.
Now that the Rangers are on the sixth floor, Livingston is on the third floor, and after the Hibernian they leave the article.
And there would be a problem in the Rangers after Calum Spence was hit first after the accident of a card caused by something in the distance.
Gerard made eight changes in the past Ayr to Bethfred Cup on the finals.
Holt, on the other hand, goes with the same 11 Livi that hit the Hearts last week and shouts how well - dressed your clothes cut the air on all sides.
Irangers may be very attractive to the ball, but Livingston has done much about the ball he found.
I was two minutes late when Menga’s release sent Scott Pittman to an article by Allan McGregor, but a player in the game lost a great opportunity to go to the world.
Keaghan's free kick Jacobs found Craig Halkettoyy-shipper but his companion Alan Lithgow was not far behind.
The Rangers were able to control but more reliable than their belief in their game in the third phase of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to find penalty in his own time against Steve Lawless but with the envelope Steven Thomson had closed the Colombian petition.
Rangers is able to place two articles on the first part of the deal directly with the palle but has an elderly Ibrox Liam Kelly who is not concerned about the rejection of Lassan Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's defeat.
During the time that Livi opened this 34 - minute period, it may not have been in the game, no one could deny that they were worthy of their activity.
Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs’ football match.
Scott Arfield did nothing while Declan Gallagher mocked Scott Robinson, who kindly sent Menga to the scene.
Gerrardube and a year after the vacation when he changed Coulibaly about Ryan Kent and the change was almost sudden when a player called on Morelos but Kelly was impressed by his line to keep it.
But Livingston continued to explain the audiences by playing their favorite game, and Lithgow and Halkett played long ball after other lengths.
Holt’s side could open the gate to the final sections, but McGregor was determined to prevent Jacobs from playing the ball in the kitchen before Lithgow.
Introduced by Rangers Glenn Middleton, he found a penthouse at the time he met Jacobs but also Thomson looks at the side.
Almanac: Geiger Counter's Luggage · Global Voices
And And even now our "Sunday Sunday" page is Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and BALA ... the day the physicist came to be born in Germany by Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of finding and measuring radioactivity, which led to the last client built only by the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has turned the pop caste, as in the late 1950s "Bells of Coronado," which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have said:
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "The Geiger Counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
While you're putting open airphones, you can't hear atoms extracted from radioactivity with mineral."
Evans says, "They're going out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days ago, 63 years ago.
But this original one bears his name forever.
A new target of cancer can teach a symmetry to protect incorrect cells
A new target of cancer can teach a sympathy to "see" wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach self-protection style to see the wrong cells as a treatment program
Method to include in the process the cell of self-sustainment, modified
'He didn't see' common protein in many cancers and then re-injected
The target of breast cancer reveals the promising effects of cancer on patients with various cancers.
A woman who was targeted, who taught a self-defense strategy to see wrong cells, saw a genetic cancer disappear over 18 months.
This method involves taking the cells that are transmitted to the patient, which are converted to the borethry to "see" the common protein in many cancers called HER2, and then re-opening the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "encourages the growth of cancer species," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
One of the same ways to take the cells in patients "and teach them" is how you understand cancer cells that work well in treating some type of lekaemia.
With the West in the mind of the crew, the Clothing is the head of MAGA, after its appearance in the summer.
Malformed expression
Once West was announced a study on Saturday Night Live after singing praises to American President Donald Trump and saying that he will make an election by 2020.
After singing his third night song, called Ghost Town, which was dressed in a cake written by Mace America Great, he began to shout at the Democrats and assured Trump’s support.
And I said, How can thou love him, that he hath mercy on me?
If, I'd been worried about hatred for long ago, I'd go to America," he said.
The SNL begins the program with the matt Damon section when it is known in Hollywood to consider the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on the legal charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it could not be broadcast, the West’s loudspeaker was placed in contact boxes by the poet Chris Rock.
Understandably, Rock was trying to contact West in writing.
After all, West complained to the onlookers that they had taken him seriously after I put him in the head.
"They confirmed me behind the table.
They said, 'It's not that hat.'
They beat me!
And they say, "I'm in the cavern," he said, according to a researcher at Washington.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place in the jungle?" he said, "I can wear his superman cap, because it means I won't tell you what to do. Do you want the earth to move forward?
I'm going to make it."
It has not been noted that two times since the viewers and the shameless SNL group, Variety reported, alone told the printers: "It was a thousand studies."
West was introduced by the artist Ariana Grande a long time ago, his ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West loved many by singing I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was accused of the head of the former TPSA group, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter, said: "It's a very courageous spirit: we've been looking forward to it."
But the organizer of the program to talk to Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "a person who doesn't sit and that's good."
"But I choose to be an artist (by buying his music or his dress or establishing his "art") that I believe is and is full of dangerous ideas in the community.
You are free.
So we do," he added.
Before the show, the rapper whispered to Twitter that he changed his name, saying he will now be called "in the old name Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The rapper size, Snoop Dog was also known as Snoop Lion and with him as the deceased singer Prince, changed his name in character and was called Prince.
Killing in Belfast
Some 45 men were convicted of attempted murder after a lion was killed in the east of Belfast in the Netherlands.

A prominent player in the game of Thornes, Kit Harrington, condemns bad guys' traditions
Kit Harrington knew much about his playful role in cutting a board called Jon Snow into an ancient series of hBO-constructed games of Thrones.
But the dancer, 31, criticizes a fascinating bird’s culture, saying that such places on the screen are for young boys to be firm for respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he believes in how to walk well and asked how to deal with a bad male tradition in the times of #Nami Also.
Kit, who recently married his brother in Game of Thrones, and his 31.
"I feel myself, and I am very affected, which is now – is life alienated from this man?" he said.
'What do we teach men when we grow up, according to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that a blind person might be able to help him to overcome a bad habit because of his wayward peers
He went on: 'What nature has been taught?
What was taught on TV, on the streets, making young boys confident of being a man?
Do I think that is a big problem at the time — do we change that?
For there is verily a disannulling of the things which are done in the sight of men.
In discussions he also agreed that he would not do prequels or sequels in the Game of Thrones when the game would end by the end of the kind, saying he's already finished with the horses' courts.
Since November, Kit will play in the True West of Sam Shepard’s story of the film and his brother, who is playing.
The director recently revealed that he thought his wife, Rose, would be the most outstanding thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
And I was with the wife of my master's house, and said, Behold, she hath given me of her own household, and I have left her unto this day.
Rose played Ygritte, a kit character Jon Snow, at the end of Amy's fantasy series.
The couple were married on Saturday, 2018, in their families in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% of progress in new situations
China announces a 14% rise in the number of people living with AIDS and who are infected with AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in this country, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases are reported in the second round of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are coming.
Most of the new cases are transmitted by chance, making changes from time to time.
But the number of people infected with AIDS this way has reduced almost to zero, and health officials in China regularly said at the Yunnan national convention.
It's a year or so, but the number of people living with AIDS and leading AIDS has risen to 100,000.
AIDS now poses a small problem in the LGBT community.
The condemnation of homosexual love in China was denounced in 1997, but it was rejected by people with the same sex.
Because of the way of life, research has shown that 70-90% of men who sleep with other men keep married to women.
Much of the disease’s impact depends on protection rather than on this system.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to reach the earth with earthquakes as a means of coping with the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that one job publishes GOP's information, issuing 'hazardous lies' and 'eight-year-olds'
in the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters sets out that one of his employees put the details of three senators in the Republican U.S. on the law firm page in Wikipedia.
Democrats of Los Angeles explained that these habits are characterized by the term "ultra-right swing" and the syllables.
"False lies, lies, and many more lies," said Waters at the station on Twitter.
The detailed details include family heads and U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah and Utah.
Information appeared on Thursday, a person unknown in Capitol Hill while listening to the Senate panel on immoral charges by the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh.
The explosion appeared after Kavanaugh had asked three senators questions.
Ancient satellites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address indicates that the Waters office is connected and that the oldest extracts the details of the Waters work, reports Hill.
"These unconfirmed claims are false and are not true," continues Waters.
"The righteousness of my employees – the property, the personal details of the person, and the safety of the criminals as a result of the abuse and abuse of the property – did not involve the release of the data.
These false claims are not true and are not true."
The Waters station quickly became an online complaint, including an old White House press by Ari Fleischer.
"Revenge is difficult," wrote Fleischer.
"This means they don't have the courage to give up the League of Nations.
If a person is hurt by something he has not done, he should not be discouraged.
He has no reason to refuse.
They should not be critical of the purpose of the fires.
They must be quiet and at peace.
Fleischer said that he compared Waters' answer to the criticism of the Democrat Jaji Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very strict at the time of the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican employee who will enter Waters' shoes in the course of the time, was inspired by his opinion on Twitter.
"More than if it is true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his tent, Waters said his office recognized "the right and the wrong of the law enforcement by these conspirators.
"We will ensure that the guilty are released," he continues, "and they will be held accountable for all their acts of humiliation and danger wherever my servants are."
View of Johnny English Strings Again – shake the spy poof of Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to consider Brexit’s importance to any British film and does not look forward to the resurrection of this Johnny English game – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and its return in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Eating hot vegetables as we say in the article that we can have a new opportunity to sell out?
In any measure, the open - air father, Johnny English’s father - in - law, has the authority to encourage new things in the second place — that name is a large collection of films designed by non - English - speaking people.
In fact, he is an entity of an unskilled investigator who even his unusual exercise will bring praise to Clouseau, describing Mr. Bean and his fuel from the Chariots of Fire theme at the London open war 2012 Olympics.
And it is taken from the visitor by a secret man Atkinson who passed through the current scenes on Barclaycard TV, who left the controversy behind in his rebellion.
There are two times in the current visit to J.
I love Johnny English, who will take the helicopter to the front of the old army and the small belts on his head.
Atkinson’s gift is a show, but laughter seems to be low and very expensive, especially in the production of "ajule" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now presents the stars as a metaphor.
The numbers above the children are older than the adults, and Johnny English’s visit to me is neither too old nor too young and focused on the silent Atkinson film that adds to the sound and personality of the Bean.
The news now goes on that Great Britain is a major continent.
The cyber-hacker enters the British research network, presenting details of British entities in the field, which concerns the entity placed in work – which is a small job in Kevin Eldon.
The last minute of the prime minister and young man is busy, facing a political failure: Emma Thompson is trying hard to imitate Teresa-May but there is no reason to write about it.
His investigators announced that all the investigators would have to leave the prisoner.
This means that Johnny English is himself, now as a schoolmaster in the background, but gives unannounced lessons about who you are: these figures, as English provides research education at the Rock-type Academy.
The English was moved to Whitehall to receive urgent orders and joined with the same Bough, also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, associated with the submarine commander, the fun place to play with Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin make real bed in the Queen's Secret Service returned, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beutul femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
There, the prime minister is quick to blame the millions who can solve computer problems: the sister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began a long journey: they started a fire in the restaurant in France; they started the problem of smoking on a boat like Volta; and the English that took off the train while learning to use the Virtual Reality headset to rent the Volt house.
All efforts have been made to improve the quality of the last chapter or to improve the quality of the energy, more than television for children.
To set them free.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t control myself: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a seven - seat spot in his tent?
Lubour denies that we are establishing a plan for Britons to work for four days but is paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn's team of Labor thinks of a wonderful plan to see Britons working for four victims — but not five paid.
The group reports that it requires company managers to transfer the benefits made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the employees by giving them more date.
It seems that the workers enjoyed the three days of the church — but they received the same money.
The sources say that this view can fit the group’s economic objective and plan to turn the nation into workers.
The four-day transition is authorized by the Trades Union Congress as a means of getting an economic advantage.
An adult source of Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: 'The police investigation is expected to be carried out before the end of the year.
'It won't happen at night but on four days at church, but working for four days is an expectation of the team's method of re-entering the economy to harvest workers and the entire concept of the field.'
The Barbour Party will not be the first to congratulate us, and the Green Party will join the four working days of its general election campaign in 2017.
The goal is not set by the entire Labor Party, or so.
"The four-day work is not the police of the organization and is not considered by the group."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the church core of Labor to express his view of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to destroy and the power returned to ‘unknown managers’ and ‘profiters’ in production plants.
The program also explains that the shareholders in the water companies may not find the entire shop as a labor government in Labour make a ‘dangerous’ in the wrong way.
He also confirmed that employees in the company's boards and the Inclusive Ownership Funds would give 10 per cent of the private-sector firm's equity to employees, who would pay a fine of £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said "60 Minutes" that FBI research on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
A FBI survey by J.B. Brett Kavanaugh reduced the time of the vote to be accepted by the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the findings of the senates could change how senators in the Republican can attract followers.
In a discussion held on Sunday, "60 Minutes" held by Scott Pelley asked Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more independent than his South Carolina.
"I'll say, really," said Kennedy.
"I went to the side, Nat, I spoke to Jaj Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this; and he came out, and said unto me, Dost thou?
He is possessed of all things, and he is hungry and naked.
Graham’s vote, or otherwise, appears to have been decided.
"My mind is focused on Brett Kavanaugh and will take a firm apology," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know this: Brett reject immediately," adds Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"Even all those who complain are not sure of that.
It has been 36 years.
I don't have anything to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Have You tried to Reduce Poverty?
At this New York Summit will host the Global Citizen Festival, a annual event with a list of players who will play with similar goals; to end hunger in the world.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have more people arriving in the capital city of Central Park not only to be pleased with Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to celebrate with the real intention of eliminating poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a part of the Global Poverty Project, a global group that strives to eradicate poverty by increasing its population.
For you to get a ticket of the item (except that you want to pay for the VIP ticket), the constables would have to do something "to do" like volunteering, sending mail to the world's leader, calling or doing something deep to help you improve your clothing.
How successful has the Global Citizen achieved its goal in the past 12 years?
Is the idea of benefiting people through the media the right way to try to do something, or just something called "clictivism" — people who feel that they make a difference by signing a list on the computer or by sending it to Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has abolished more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, attempting to achieve different objectives.
It says that this action has helped to silence earth’s owners to devote themselves to more than $37 billion goals that will affect the health of the people of 2.25 billion by 2030.
In 2018 the group began to mark 390 views and reports from their actions, about $10 billion being converted or tried to collect.
The group estimates that the money they spend directly on people around the world is about 649 million.
Another dedication involving The Power of Nutrition, U.S. farmers and beginners who gave themselves "to help children properly," is promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end hunger in the country after getting 4,700 tweets in Global Cities.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of countries, and Global Citizens like you, we can try to make history of human suffering because of the lack of justice in the community," the Power of Nutrition with Ambassador Tracey Ullman writes in a statement in London in April 2018.
The group also said that there would be over 5,000 years to call the U.K. to make a better diet for mothers and children, the government announces support for the project, the Power of Nutrition, which is available to women and children of 5 million with access to healthy food.
In response to some of the FAQs on their website, he asked, "What do you think we can do to eliminate big clothes?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will get tired and fail.
But, as public rights and anti-partidity negotiations before us, we will win, because we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others who will enjoy this year's event in New York, which will be celebrated by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. would like to use the "consultation" to prevent the transmission of energy from Russia - Interior Secretary
Washington "if necessary" could use the Amani to store Russian energy markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke published, under the auspices of the Washington Examiner.
You all say Russian and Syria's talks -- clearly, when it works with the government’s legalization — is the way to try some new energy markets.
"I believe in the reason why the Middle East wants to find energy such as in Eastern Europe, and in the field of agriculture and Europe," he said.
Also, according to the employee, there are ways to correct it.
"The United States knows, with our team, to ensure that maritime routes are open, and, if necessary, to be closed, to ensure that their energy is not marketed," he said.
Zinke also spoke in a group that can be taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group that has no useful role to call themselves "a power user vote" in the U.S.
He also compared Washington’s efforts to work with Russia and Iran, saying the results are similar.
"The choice of trade with Iran and Russia, to a certain extent, is a way of getting and getting oil," he said, while speaking of Russia as "a horse with wings" and has a reliable economy on the oil lines.
These ceilings appear as Trump's offices make efforts to encourage the transmission of their liquid natural gas into Europe, which is in place of Russia, the most expensive route for European buyers.
As a result, officials of the Trump office, including U.S. president Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to get out of the North Stream 2 "unsuitable", according to Trump, making Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream’s pipelines are $21 billion, which is scheduled to double the current pipe rate of 110 billion cubic metres, not really a economic project.
Kremlin says that opposition to the Washington project is inevitably caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that power cannot be the instrument of pressure and that buyers should be able to choose who they are to buy," said Russian Government Minister Aleksandr Novak after the U.S. Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has made Germany dreamt of it, which reaffirms its commitment to this project.
A leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to be committed to the EU's energy target and the agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interrupts our sending power," said Dieter Kempp, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "You Will Watch" to Join the President's Election in 2020, says Massachusts Senator
The Masachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren went to the "visit" conclusion to enter the election as president after the mid-term election.
During a district convention in the city of Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren has made sure that you will consider joining the election.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government that includes a woman who will be the leader," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look forward to joining the election as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during a city hall meeting, saying "he was talking to people who betrayed them.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump did to our people," he said.
Warren spoke freely against Trump and the one who chose the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In what he wrote on Twitter on Friday, Warren says, "It's true that we need an FBI investigation before voting."
A report published on Thursday, however, shows that most of Warren's followers do not think they should make a choice by 2020.
50 percent "probably" people of Massachusetts said that the senator should not vote, in accordance with figures found by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% have supported that it is not available.
Statistics show another support that former Governor Deval Patrick had no choice, 38 percent said it was not enough and 48 percent said it was not.
Some of the names discussed by the top profile Democrats that may have added to the 2020 election include President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will decide legally on January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's funeral
Track Palin, aged 26, spends a year in Iraq after the war ended in September.
He was arrested and put in prison for his family’s rest during the night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through is back, I see how some families feel about the painful effects of PTSD and other damage to the soldiers when we return," he told the audience at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a fugitive in the camp" and said about his son and other soldiers, "they were different people, they were confirmed, and they asked themselves if there was any respect for what the soldiers and the air forces, and all the other soldiers, had done to their country."
He was arrested on the Middle East in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by beating a woman, interrupted the family vacation report and set aside time, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police gate in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports the work of the new protection target
The 18 states and the District of Colombia support a new legal effort to achieve a new U.S. target that prevents the protection of people who escape from the scourge of customs or home.
The representatives of the 18 states and the region sent a document on Friday in Washington to support a person who needed protection against this threat, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the suspect at Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union introduced in August against the government's undisputed goal.
He told his colleagues "and his sons, who have become members of this destructive habit," insulted him, but U.S. officials could still accept his request for protection on July 20.
It has been settled in Texas.
Representatives of the government supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced many people with U.S. protection applications, such as countries facing major problems with customs and homelessness.
The new U.S. protection campaign is reversing the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allows undocumented visitors to escape homelessness to find protection.
The Attorney General of the Columbia Foundation Karl Racine said on Friday that the new goal "was to observe the ten years of government law, and the whole world."
"The law states that all applications for protection must be judged on the facts of each application, and making such a decision is a violation of that law," the court-appointed witness said.
The representatives also stated that the campaign prevented the arrivals from killing the U.S. economy, saying they could be businessmen and "start jobs."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions has advised young people to no longer protect refugees from domestic violence and child abuse in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or whether a member of a group or political opinion," said Sessions in his June 11 call on purpose.
Protection was not intended to solve all problems -- even all major problems -- people around the world face each day.
Great efforts have been made in Palu as the number of deaths is repeated in attempts to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation was distressing.
"It's really funny," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her son at the base of those who had survived in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulent carries the bodies.
There are also no clean water."
The inhabitants seem to return to their nests, looking at their belongings in many waters, trying to find anything they can find.
Hundreds of people also need hospitals, which are subjected to 7.5 shocks, were full of colds.
Some of those disabled, including the Dwi Haris, who had broken the neck and shoulders, sat outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of persistent injuries.
He tears in his eyes as he recalls how hard he was in the room of a five - room hotel with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to find a way to save.
I was stressed on broken walls, I think," Harris approached the Associated Press, adding that his family is a city in the marriage.
"I felt the widow crying for help, and it was calm again.
I don’t know what’s going on with him and with my child.
I have hope of their life.
The U.S. petition accuses China 'frequency' with high standards'
After a week, China's legal paper has a four-page sample showing U.S. commercial goods benefiting both the U.S. and China, a U.S. press in China accused Beijing of using an American paper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Tuesday spoke of China's Daily payroll in Des Moines Register - the Iowa newspaper that was wrongly purchased - after accusing China of seeking to join the election issue on November 6 in the U.S., which China rejected.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to get into the U.S. election led to what U.S. officials say to Reuters is a new feature in the Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for governments in other countries to expand their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that allows for an endless flow of taxes when sending goods.
The funds required by China at the beginning of the trade war were intended to torture messengers in such places as Iowa supporting the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and U.S. reformers said.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. candidate in China and a long-term ruler in Iowa, who is sending many agricultural goods to China, says Beijing is harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "it's twice as bad as making false ads in our newspaper."
"In the case that has been published, the Chinese government has made it available to the American popular law of freedom of speech to the newspaper by putting the advertising paid to the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, instead of selling newspapers on the road here in Beijing, there are many different views that you will find and you will not see the real reaction of Chinese people to different views that may have with the economic consequences of the Chinese economy, if the media are thought to be looking at what the Chinese Communist Party is doing," he writes.
He added that "one of the press that has gone ahead in China has escaped the opportunity to print" his story, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican Women Dedicated Before Internal Elections Because of Kavanaugh’s Failure, Warning the Reviewers · Global Voices
Since many of the above-mentioned Republicans are awaiting and protecting the opportunity to be brought to the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh on several charges of fraud, the auditors warned that the wood would be returned to the farmer, particularly the standing, during the internal and future elections.
Top papers on this, and many Republicans have already indicated that they wanted to move forward with the election.
These things will no longer be arranged," Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published by the Final.
Reeher argues that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s final efforts to investigate the FBI will suffice to make angry voters stumble.
"Women will not forget what happened on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the prosecutors called out "Come-November!" as they were in the Senate church as the Republicans ruled the Judicial Committee chose to proceed and select Kavanaugh despite evidence issued by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democrats and leaders' zeal will end in the end," said Stu Rothenberg, a political reformer, telling reporters.
"People say that it's already hot. That's true.
But it's more than that, especially among female voters in cities and youth voting, from 18 to 29 years old, that although they don't like the president, they don't usually vote."
Even before Ford's testimony, it was clear that the details of his case against the time when the Supreme Court was brought to trial, noting that the wood could be returned to the observer if the Republicans continued to advance and confirm.
"This has already been a GOP disaster," said Michael Steele, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the committee vote or the last vote or that Kavanaugh is placed in the budget, as regards how the Republicans can do this and how they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of the Privileges USA, a group that helps people choose Democrats, telling the press station.
However, the Americans seemed to differ between who was admitted to the Ford and the Kavanaugh evidence, and they were inclined to see Kavanaugh.
New figures from YouGov show that 41 percent of people are sure or certain to believe in Ford's evidence, whereas 35 percent say that they are sure or to some extent believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was absolutely or to some extent lying to the evidence they had given him, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least one complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke in front of the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had been arrested at the age of 17.
Ramirez says a prosecutor at the Supreme Court revealed his secret assets to him during the time of the administration during your studies in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Developer Starts New Google and Facebook Networks
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, initiates a program to match the walls of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technology project, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source of the Berners-Lee platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and where people are allowed to access it.
In a special conversation with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee made the remark that the Inrupt's aim is "to control the earth."
"We have to do now," he says about this job.
"It's history."
This app uses Solid technology to allow people to create "personal online data storage" or POD.
Whether or not the lists of people’s figures, which should be made, the calendar, the music collection, and other professional and personal tools are available.
Such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all found in the same bridge and at the same time.
Notable for a POD store that depends on the user who can find any type of data.
The company calls it "the art that makes you strong."
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company carries rice, prosthesis and ability to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a protected platform based on IBM, non-profit workers working on the project, as well as many volunteers.
Since this week, professional beginners around the world may have started their apps using the tools available in Inrupt.
Berners-Lee and his group are talking to "Facebook and Google about whether it is right or not to bring about a complete change where all their businesses will change completely.
"We ask for their permission."
In another post on the Media printed on the Final, Berners-Lee writes that the Inrupt "needs to give the trade power and the operating system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid document."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has led to a debate on not taking sides.
Even when Inrupt is published, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Author and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look red at the beginning of this coming time of the week," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A professor who found Victoria Cross on WW1
It is the only church of England's clergy to join Victoria Cross during World War I that has been registered in their city 100 years later.
Ult Col Professor Bernard Vann received the title on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglesi and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not find that he won the greatest prize in the British military.
The memorial stone has been opened to two of her grandpas during the earthquake in Rushden, Northamptonshire, at the end.
One of his grandfathers, Michael Vann, said to be a "good sign" that the stone was opened in the year immediately since his grandfather received a prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his army to defeat the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a fortress that was beating down with guns and rifles."
Later he rushed to the rescue site and "with great courage" took the lead before running the gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German bomber on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's actions "are something I don't know I couldn't do but something that makes me respect him."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, gave flowers after meals, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "a country with great privilege for having a share in the drought" and said "the collapse of real civilization is demonstrated with the support of many people."
MMA followers stayed all night watching Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig
Just think, you stay all night watching Bellator 206 and you're not allowed to watch the event.
The San Jose event was 13 games, including six in the main card and was shown all night in UK on Channel 5.
On 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, UK observers were surprised when the station moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy after waiting all night until they were especially late for the trip.
One Twitter follower explained this shift to children's lives "as an unexpected dream."
"It is a government law that by 6 a.m. this movement is not appropriate for this purpose it has had to be changed to the children's agenda," says Dave Schwartz, the vice president of the Bellator for trade and communication, when asked about this change in the agenda.
"U Peppa the Pig," yes.
The president of the company Bellator Scott Cooker said they would look at their sails to include UK observers in the future.
"I think that if I think about playing it again, I think we can try to play it," said Cooker.
"But it's the sixth hour on Sunday where and we won't be able to fix this until Sunday in our time, Monday in their time.
But it is above it.
I tell you, when it comes to changing, there are many instructions that have been sent to each other and all are not.
They were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise it will never happen again.
We will keep five connections at least six, as we often do and try to please our followers and have become tired.
For this cause I was not in need of any labour.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'out of the house' because of his sex
Olympics counselor Tom Daley says he is growing up as a result of his sex -- but that gives him a sense of success.
The 24-year-old teacher said he was blind and went to high school and said, "He's not everybody who loves me."
Speaking of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs published by Lauren Laverne, he spoke of the rights of the world to give others a "hope."
He also said that if the parent had done so, he would have had a case against the Olympics.
A regular girl of the current program, Christy Young, has been unemployed for months because she is ill.
From being a lost person in Laverne's first program, Daley says that he felt "out of the neighborhood" is everyone in his early childhood because "it was unacceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are nothing, but are different. He has given you the power and the strength to do it."
He wanted to show that he was "a man," he said, so that everyone would not be disappointed when finally found he was a bully.
The winner who won the Olympics' title twice became a high-ranking LGBT profile and used his position in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to view it as a crime.
You have spoken because you feel ashamed to be able to live a quiet life without having to face problems and want to give others a "hope."
This three-time winner of the global movement has been in love with a male - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met with him in 2013 - "I'm not expecting."
Daley married and was awarded Oscar's pension, which he left 20 years ago, but says he never had a problem with leaving each other for years.
"When you face so much in life," -- to his first Olympics, 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it would be hard to find someone who was equal to him who had suffered the same conditions.
These two found a child in June, a boy who pretends to be Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "his opinion" has changed.
"If you could ask me last year, you'd also understand that I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold levels.
My Olympic gold ring is Robbie."
Her son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he wondered if we had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be there.
"I couldn't say 'you can't be in those games," he said.
"I touched her hand when she breathes the last and until she breathes the last and dies where I saw that she is a person like us," she said.
The following year Daley joined the 2012 Olympics movement and received a scholarship.
"I saw that here something I had always wanted my whole life -- to punish my people in the Olympic Games, nothing more than that," he said.
It also made him choose the most popular song - Heather Small's Proud - while focusing on the time to prepare the Olympics and put it on the stage.
The Desert Island Discs is BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson is not a good player. He's sitting on the bench at Ryder Cup in the end.
American Phil Mickelson will record a story on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but they will have to raise socks so as not to be a sad story.
Michaelson, who will be playing in this event for the next two 12 years, is sitting on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on the Fourballs and the Final Fours.
Instead of taking the lead, as he often took the lead when he listened to the United States, the five - year winner split up twice a day and worked in his game with the hope of finding out what was driving him.
Since you are not a good player to play the ball even if you are in the time of the game, this 48-year-old player is not suitable for the Le Golf National Death game, where there is a great game where it is usually a problem if you play a ball away.
And if the place to play is not so much a problem, Michaelson, will play the eighth game on Sunday, you will face Francisco Molinari, the British Open, who can play the ball, and Tommy Fleetwood who's playing red to win four of their games this week.
If these Americans, who lost four points in 12 single players, started a game well, the game of Michaelson could be a drawback.
Furyk expresses his hope for his brothers, and nothing else is said.
"You fully understand the role they have today, you put me in the woods and you said you'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"You're very confident.
He is a well - known player and has much to do with these groups in the past, as well as this week.
I probably never thought of playing two games.
I expected more, but that is what happened and what we thought we should do.
You want to play, like everyone else."
Mickelson will record a new history of Nick Faldo's most popular games in Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It might be his last game in the Reuters Cup that you have never played as a player.
Michaelson won 18 times, played 20 games at the same level, although Furyk said his presence had promoted the group.
"It's nice to be with her, she likes to ruin, she laughs, she likes to make jokes about people, and she's a nice person to be with her in the group room," he explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed being with him, and, in this report, it's good to see you.
It's a lot more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that many points are nothing
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows that taking on many points on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
Dane played for the first time in 1997 in Valderrama, when a team of Captain Seve Ballesteros led five points over the United States but eventually took the lead on one point, winning at 141⁄2-131/2.2.
"You always remember that we started with many points in Valderrama; we started with many points in Brooklyn, where we were eaten, and Valderrama, where we won, but for a few points," said Bjorn, who is on the team, after watching the 2018 Class wins 5-3 both on Friday and peace to lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that group that it is no longer over.
Do all you can tomorrow.
Be there and do everything in the right way.
It is not until you find the points.
We have a goal, and you are striving to take it, and it is what we depend on.
I have already said this, that I focus on 12 players in our team, but we know that you're the best in this group -- the biggest players in the world."
Happy for the way his players played where it was hard to play, Bjorn has added: "I will never reach the end of this.
The game was a draw.
The future will determine how each player will play, and that is a different matter.
It is good to go out with a person when things are going well, but if you are alone, it is where you are fully tested as a golf player.
This is the message you have to pass to the players, doing everything you can to the future.
Now, you leave the player or he or she behind, and you have to go and do everything you can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will walk with him to see that his players played better alone than they had ever built, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who just got three points.
Furyk himself knows both eating and winning on the last day the last minute, as he has become part of the winning group in Brooklyn before he was shot when Europe "sucked miracles in Medinah."
"I remember well," she always said when she was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, supported her players when it was to be played the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be nice to start with the highest language as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When that bridge and the interest continues to disappear, he puts great pressure on those games in the middle of the room.
We arranged our players according to that, and put our players in the way we thought we'd be able to do the test tomorrow."
Thomas is given the task of trying to get back to fight and play and face Rory McIrroy in the previous game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper part of Europe.
"I'm going with this group this way because I think it's going to organize the whole game," Bjorn said selected players.
A German battleship was re-arranged
A new type of German Navy passenger called frigate had to start operating in 2014 took place in the old Cold War-era, but will not be there until the next year due to the systems and the cost of snowballs, local news reporters report.
The commission of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the new ship's leader Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate, is now translated into the first half of 2019, says the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to join Navy in 2014, but the problems arising after the divergence were undermining the future of a stable project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were the only Navy since 2007 who will take the position of Bremen-Class ships.
It is understandable that ships will have powerful submarines, types of bombs that launch underground bombs and hidden aircraft and technology, such as the undetected location, infrared and air-conditioned engines.
Some of the important items put together include long periods of care that could not be used for new ships until two years later.
However, the ongoing decline means that the important development of warships - will give Germany the strength to move forward - will end time when it starts to work, says Die Zeit.
The F125 dead cargo ship appeared on board last year, when German Navy denied the use of the ship and returned it to the Blohmbnase-Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
it was the first time the Navy restored the ship to which it was made after being carried.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship's return, but German newsmen said much more about the "software and hardware" that made the warship useless when you were sent to the war.
Software problems were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships would be used by a group of 120 ships - part of the former Bremen class ship crew.
Again it appeared that the ship has a higher speed than what is necessary to reduce its operation and that the Navy is able to put things ahead of its future.
The 7,000thon "Rheinland-Pfalz" believes it has twice the same size as German ships used in the Second World War.
Apart from hardware problems, the entire budget of the project - including training a team of sailors - is a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 million ($3.2.6bn) - from €2.2 million.
The problems of new ships are very important as there are recent warnings that the nuclear power of Germany has fallen.
At the beginning of that year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Polish committee, admitted to the Navy that he was well "careful for the exit and entry of unusable ships."
The captain has dealt with problems in time, for old ships are no longer working but are not working on ships instead.
He is disappointed that no Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships have been able to join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the animals
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how animals use local production when producing food.
It is believed that what will be found will give us a better understanding of the way these rare creatures live and help us to direct future surveillance activities.
A National Trust for Scotland research will follow the usual aquifers and daubenton pybrills with long ears in Inverwee Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be set up in some places to examine the activities of the ancestors throughout this year.
NHS workers and volunteers will conduct small surveys using manual-handed observers.
A reasonable analysis of all the records will show the presence of the male’s cries and what some animals do.
The map of the sites and reports will be published to build a detailed picture of the environment in which they live.
Rob Dewar, an expert on the conservation of NTS animals, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to animals and how these animals are used.
This information will help you to see the benefits of space management such as the mead creation and the best way to maintain forested habitats and other animals associated with them.
Scotland’s animals and the rest of the UK have been banned throughout the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and construction of buildings that affect their habitat and their loss.
High - powered and fire - resistant machines may pose a threat, and the paper may also kill airplanes and building maintenance plants, as well as the attack on damaged cats.
Animals are not truly invisible.
However, as they do at night, their ears are much more active than their eyes if they feed the animals.
They use a complex ability to hear where the heat comes from in order to get animals and objects from where they fly.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares across the country, considers them important for animals.
He has ten trained professionals, who regularly do research, examine where he lives and how to protect them.
The association also arranged for the first Scottish farmer and its sole species in the Threave in Dumfries and in Galloway, where there are eight species of Scotland’s 10 species.
The local administrator David Thompson says this is a nice place to live.
"Here in Threave is the best place for the young," he said.
"We have old buildings, many large trees and other suitable places.
But there is much about animals we don't know, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us understand more about what we need to live."
It stresses the importance of examining whether there are animals before working in buildings because it is possible that subsidizing their single residence could kill about 400 female and small animals, almost killing all those living in that area.
Animals are protected and the law does not allow them to be killed, tortured, or destroyed or destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust chief, encouraged the community to help you.
He said, "There are many things that we ought to do for our children, and many kinds of people don't know what he is doing to them."
Ronaldo rejects complaints of fraud as the officials arrange to pay for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo speaks of allegations that he has called him "false stories," saying that people "wanted to improve themselves" by using his name.
His representatives arranged to pay the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which he published.
This Portuguese player and Juventus are accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is reported that he has paid $375.000 to close his mouth on this occasion, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on the Instagram Live video with 142 million of his followers after the reports were reported, Ronaldo, aged 33, quoted the reports as "false stories."
"Cha, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today is false news," says a balloon d'Or five-way camera.
"They try to build a name by using my name.
It's normal.
They want me to use my name, but it is part of their work.
I'm happy and everything is good for me," adds the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's agents are preparing to pay Der Spiegel for the damages, calling themselves "an unacceptable report on the consequences of personal life," says Reuters.
Agent Christian Schertz said that the player will want money back "to be paid equal to the size of his reputation, probably the most serious loss of a person's rights recently."
The reported incident is reported to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino room in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room, where he was called to visit him, according to the paper posted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Maiorga says Ronaldo fell apart after the incident and told him that "he's a ready person" "99 percent" had errors "not one percent."
The documents said Ronaldo agreed that they were both married, but they agreed.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took pictures of their suspects at the hospital, but later she admitted that the case could be handled outside the court because she felt "feared to repeat" and worried "by public humiliation."
The 34-year-old girl says she now wants to break the agreement as she continues to suffer from what is said.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the report, and this year he transferred to the large Italian group Juve to an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: The UK 'will always apologize' for the loss of car owners
The UK "will always regret" if it will lose its position as world leader in the beginning of cars after Brexit, says the Business No.
He also added that "is worrying" that Toyota UK tells the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without the agreement it will temporarily put production in its market in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese designer said that the result of drinking on the border when the agreement with Brexit was not successful could create the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston industry - which makes Auris and Avenis of Toyota - produces about 150,000 cars last year and 90% are sent to other European Union countries.
"I think that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March the product will stand in our industry," says Marvin Cooke, an executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have paid for EU exits without the agreement on how to trade with other countries to work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mining industry in Oxford a month ago in Brexit.
The concern is mainly related to what car designers call a danger if the Brexit agreements are not fulfilled.
Toyota's production is carried out "at the same time as necessary", parts of the vehicles arrive every 37 minutes from both UK and EU car operators.
If the UK leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, there may be obstacles to that industry that could lead to the burning and end of the parts of the vehicle construction.
It is impossible for Toyota to catch more than a day's car built in their Derbyshire factory, says the company, so the product may need to be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers programme for future EU cooperation "is carefully designed to avoid border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to get the best deal we can afford as not only the success we will now enjoy but if we take this opportunity," says the today's BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other industries is that we need to be fully able to continue with what we are about to accomplish."
Toyota could not mean how long the product will be fixed, but in time, it warns that the cost-added will reduce the efficiency of the industry and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for Burnaston for 24 years and who connects him to this U.S. capital factory, says: "For what I have seen if these jobs are all over again.
A government speaker says: "We have set a clear and reliable agenda for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein conference can drink again, says the White House
A funeral held by Donald Trump and the general representative of Rod Rosenstein may be "extended for one week" as the war of the Supreme Court and the establishment of Brett Kavanaugh continues, says White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein directs the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's electoral disturbances, the connection between Trump and Russia, and any violations of justice that may arise from the president.
Whether Trump will remove the general representative's flag, thus endangering Mueller's freedom, Washington has given unexplained news for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had a discussion with the press to cut off the talk with Trump and the opportunity to be removed by the president on the 25th floor.
Rosenstein was afraid.
But last Saturday you went to the White House, even though there's reports that you're leaving the job.
Instead, meeting Trump, then the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump says "supposes" not to disobey Rosenstein but the meeting has begun to open up to avoid questioning the Senate ruling committee where Kavanaugh and one of the accused women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both became a witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, which further reduced the full vote of the Senate.
You write about Trump, Sarah Sanders, and you come to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The day of the event that has not been set, it may be this week, I think that it will be arranged in a week as there are other continuing and high court matters.
But we shall see, and will declare abroad unto them that have heard of it.
Other news reporters may disagree: Sanders has never had a press conference in White House since 10 September.
Administrator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the decline of these meetings is due to the fact that the media "love to talk," although he said, "I can't deny the fact that they speak."
He also indicated that there will be more than one connection between Trump and the news.
"The president asked the agencies questions and answers to any other president before him," he said, adding without giving evidence: "We looked at that number."
There will be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the press have an opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that many times and we've seen how much we've done in the past few weeks and it's gonna take the position of a press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually listens to questions when coming out of the White House or when he participates in public agencies or news sources and respected visitors.
It is not uncommon for him to ask questions when alone.
New York in this week the president has probably shown why, without any news, sometimes by speaking inconsistency in front of the press.
Health writer writing to EU employees in the NHS in Scotland about what Brexit is afraid of
A Health Letter has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show their appreciation for the world's wishes to live in post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter last 6 months before the UK was directly EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the necessary costs of EU citizens’ applications for public assistance.
In his book, Nksz Freeman wrote: "In the same way, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued, looking at the expected decisions in this regard.
But the UK government is also still preparing its plans for a non-agreement.
I know that this may not be the time for you all.
That is why I want to stress now how I appreciate the work done by all the members of the staff, no matter where they live.
Our brothers from the EU, as well as other places, have brought with them a valuable pill and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we work for.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christy Abercrombie is immediately treated after headache
Tennessee State Tigers' player Christ Abercrombie has been diagnosed immediately after the head injury during the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennesse State trainer Rod Reed tells reporters that injury occurred just before the break.
"When you came to the bathroom you suddenly fell down," said Reed.
Doctors and staff gave Abercrombie health to the bathroom before placing her in the stretcher and took her back to check.
The president of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "no details about the present type/size of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a red student, his first pain and Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
You've already built five times on the finish before leaving the game, making an 18-time hard drive.
Buyers in other countries will be paid in cash at the bank when buying a house in the UK
Buyers in other countries will be paid a short-term pension when they buy a UK house to help those with no housing facilities under the new Tory schemes
This will make it difficult for Corbyn to find young people to vote
The increase in the amount of the fund will be required for those who do not contribute to the UK
Money changers expect to earn about £120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers in other countries will be paid the company’s surplus if they buy a house in the UK - this money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be regarded as an attempt to make Jeremy Corbyn difficult to succeed in an attempt to attract new people to volunteer to get more expensive homes and to look at people who are leading a lot of money.
The removal of the fund will apply to people and businesses who do not pay to the UK, and this paid money will help the Government's efforts to eliminate homeless people.
This money is spent on the bank’s current finances, including the high bidders placed two years ago in the second and third - largest houses.
The money changers expect this to give them about £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built houses in London were purchased by non-UK citizens, raising figures and making it difficult for beginners to find houses.
Many of the rich in this capital - especially the capital - have become "citys that cry out for the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time not in this country.
A new goal came a few weeks later, Boris Johnson spoke of a reduction in the group's tax to help more young people get the first houses.
He ignored businesses that had built up the buildings by taking up the building site and not using it, and urged Nkz May to shut down quotas in the homes that were sold to repair Britain's "house cleaning".
Mr. Corbyn announced a comprehensive plan for the proposed change in households, including the control of savings and the elimination of the "no mistake".
He also wants to give more energy to build new homes.
Nukkz May says: "Last year I will devote myself to restoring Britain's dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the sale of houses.
Britain will always be willing to accept people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it will not be easy for people who do not see the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses rather than the hard workers of Britain.
For many people the dream of having a house is something that can't be reached, and there is no shame in sleeping on the street."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest wish is to be a Scotland trainer'
Sanderland administrator Jack Ross says "a great wish" is to be Scotland's trainer one day.
Russ, 42 years old, wants a challenge to help the North-East group, now third in League One, left three points by the upper group.
He goes to the Stadium of Light this way after helping St. Mirren return to Scottish Premiership in the past.
"I wanted to play our country as a player.
I got B cap and so on," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when I was young, and this was what I thought.
I can only get this opportunity, however, if I succeed as a small team trainer."
The pre-Ross trainees in Sydney included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, an Alloa Athletic trainer, said he was not afraid to come after the senior trainees in this large group, as he rejected requests from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"The respect I have now will be asked, 'Can I return this group to the Premier League?'
As a result of the creation and creation of the group, there is no doubt that it should join the Premier League," he said.
"He lets me go back there, but I'll probably look like a success where I can bring this group back."
Ross is only three years old as a trainer, after a short time trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months of training at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa get out of the field, and he turned St. Mirren, who was almost eaten by the snake, into the champion's pen for the next time.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It has always changed completely," he recalls, training Alloa.
"I was absolutely sure that the training work was worth it, rather than being a player.
It sounds pointless because I played well, lived a good life, and had fun.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things you should do every week.
Even now, I do those things when faced with pressures and pressures to work, but I like training.
For a long time I wanted to train, and now I can do it, and I feel that I am doing what I want to do with my whole life as an elder."

The best time for the pint is 5.30pm in the end, meaning the test
The entry of a type to the British coffee shop was hard to pull but the food stores were hard to bear.
Groupes and boats are driven by 2.7 percent of people buying on July -- but in stores of good food by 4.8 percent, it means figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who is the leader of these figures, says: "The continued success and long-term participation of England is expected in the World Cup means that July follows the same way as last June, when the tops rise by 2.8 percent, unless restaurants lie down.
The fall by 1.8 percent in sales in restaurants in June has been very bad in July.
Drinkers and bars are more expensive than restaurants.
Peanuts carry heavy loads of food to the sun, although it has not been as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people who simply wanted to get away with it would get drunk.
The consumption of alcohol rose by 6.6 percent this month, by three percent. "
Paul Newman, editor of the joys and acceptance of the RSM visitors, says: "These results continue to progress as we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major events or sports events will always be a powerful reason when it comes to marketing in the markets.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to attract hard, although sales of good 4.8% each year will be painful despite the problems of continuing costs.
The long-term heat is very bad in food stores and in time it will appear that the low temperatures we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in paper sales and food stores, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent on July, which showed the decline in brand numbers.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's business monitor for the tobacco sector, bars and restaurants of the UK, collects and updates 47 working groups, produces more than £9 million, and is the beginning of a growing industry.
One out of five children have secret accounts in the communication centers they hide their parents
One child in five - 11 years of age - a secret account in the communication centers she hid her parents and teachers, showing up
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the "false in Insta" pages.
News reports create anxiety about postpartum exposure
20 percent of people who have "no" accounts show children
One child of five - 11 years of age - opens up accounts of the communication centers that have hidden them from the elderly.
A survey of 20,000 high-level school students showed rapid growth in the "insta's fake" accounts - which refers to the fact that they send images to Instagram.
News has created a fear of being sent to show honor.
Twenty percent of those who use a clean account "not" show their parents, while they have other secrets.
One mother who somehow saw the secret of her 13-year-old daughter found a young woman who asked others to "stumble her."
This study, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC), found 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age who have two profiles, their share admits that they have secret accounts.
HMC manager Mike Buchanan says: "It's disturbing that so many young people try to put their accounts online where parents and teachers don't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "player voice" on the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was selected by the Scottish Athletics board as the director of the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a Scotland favorite player and poet Ian Beattie described this as a good opportunity for those who lead a game to win from his large piano in games that included other countries ten years ago.
"Eilida is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all players in the world and we are sure that Scotland's games will benefit greatly by bringing her to the board," said Beattie.
Doyle says, "I'm determined to be the voice of the players and I hope to give a lot of attention and help me direct the games in Scotland."
This American player, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 in Atlanta between his four Olympics and now an ordinary BBC scientist, found himself unable to walk after the death of the side (TIA).
He wrote to Twitter: "Last year I died yesterday.
I failed to walk.
Doctors say that in time it will appear to me whether I will improve or how much.
As a teenager, I was quite young, and I learned to walk, and today I am self - centered!
Thank you for the instructions to encourage me!"
The broadcast of mother-to-child-like eggs is based on the Internet
The pump company has created a difference over the Internet with a comparison between breast-feeding mothers and breast-feeding babies.
To mark the insertion of what is said to be "the first-fashioned bell bell in the world," Elvie's client company has issued a video announcement of a destructive song to show freedom a new drum that gives birth mothers.
Mothers who sing a song in the dog's ear say, "Yes, I do, but you don't see a dog" and then say, "If you don't see this isn't a dog, my ears."
"He said to her, 'The cup is the new moon, the spring is gone out, the children are delivered. The bridegroom is taken away, and the bridegroom is taken away, and the children are with him.
However, this publication, published on the company’s Facebook page, created a problem online.
The 77,000 video that had been seen with hundreds of governments, received opinions different from viewers, when many said it looked down on the "hardness" of the milk industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
As they need to be pregnant and born to take milk, unless their children are taken after birth," writes another.
Elvie’s breast pump is hidden inside the breast-feeding barrier (Elvie/Mother)
One says, "It's difficult for both of them to have a mother and a child.
But why do you not rather let yourselves be declared worthy of the kingdom of God, that you may have something to distribute to someone in need and in need?
And another said, "This is not appropriate."
Some protected us from this announcement, one woman admitted that she had found a song "a joke."
"I think this is a good idea.
They would buy me if they wanted to.
Smoking made me feel like a horse and a horse.
The announcement was very embarrassing but I heard what it meant.
This product will be a real help," writes another.
One commented: "This announcement is fun and refers to the mother of the bombers (usually at work or in private homes) and they feel "like cattle."
This is not an advertising that glorifies or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a team of standing representatives shows that they have already been dancing with hidden drums under their shoulders.
The campaign’s objective is to build on the idea that many women who use breast milk feel like cattle.
But Elvie Pump, who is not angry, has no legs or shoes and wears it hidden under the breastbone, gives women the freedom to bite, carries their children, and throws them out.
Ana Barin, who is equal to the ECD of Mother, noted: "Elvie Pump is a product that will be very helpful so you deserve the clear way to publish it.
By comparing pregnant women with cattle we want to place the seeds and all their challenges in the public field, while we demonstrate in a joyful and reasonable way the feeling of relief that will bring it.
This is not the first time Elvie's flag to be questioned.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from the catwalk of designer Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of children arriving peacefully move to a camp near the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied children has increased even though it has not changed the number of months they passed across the border, partly because the police did not have the Tromp's office set up to make it difficult to provide children with support.
Often, many supporters become undocumented arrivals, and they have been afraid to seize their opportunity to live in this area by acting as a parent.
The danger is serious in June, when the authorities announce that supporters and other senior members of the household will have to send fingerprints, and that the detachment will be given to the authorities of the arrival.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of Immigration and Customs Force, admitted before Congress that this technology is binding on many people who have signed up to support children without parents.
The engineer later admitted that 70 percent of those arrested were innocent of the crime.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who do not support themselves or family members are illegally present in this area, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we keep looking for those people," said Mr. Albence.
They want to promulgate the children quickly, the authorities have introduced new laws that will require some of them to appear in court during the month, not after 60 days, which was the previous law, in accordance with the employees of the Shelter.
Many will come from the door of the video main, not literally, to ask for legal rights in the audience.
Those considered inappropriate will soon be put to death.
If children remain in prison for a long time, they may be troubled or depressed, which may lead to an accident or to try to escape, in line with the security personnel and the reports published from the train station last month.
Officials say this concern is growing at a much larger station like the Tornillo, where signs of a child’s heavy drag may be overlooked, due to the size of the area.
They also add that moving children to the city of the tent without giving them time to prepare for emotional or social gatherings can lead to many problems that already exist.
Syria tells US, France and Turkey's 'invasive' forces to attack immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Government Walid al-Moualem spoke to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in their country is now its eighth year.
Moualem, who is again the hero of the great empire, tells Syrian troops illegally, that they will end terrorism, and "will not be taken properly."
"You have to go immediately out of business," he said to the audience.
Moulalem insists that "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, when more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes.
Damascus says it will continue to "war this holy war and clean up all Syrian territory" in terrorist groups as well as "no one from another."
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, focusing on training and guidance of Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers who are not soldiers in a war - torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moulalem says that conditions allow them to return, and he calls "some Western countries" "they may be afraid" so that refugees may return.
He said, "We have spoken to the world community and to the people who live in it, to ensure that the refugees return."
"They pursue politics as a matter of concern only to the citizens of the community."
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not help her Syria again until a political agreement was made between Assad and those who opposed the end of the war.
The UN petitioners say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a barrier to the opposition of his last great king of Idlib is the opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevents major attacks by Syrian soldiers supported by Russia in the country, where three million people live.
But Moualem insists that the agreement "was set a clear time" and hopes that soldiers will attack the Jihadists and Nustra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "will be killed."
The UN candidate Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon organize the first meetings of the new committee which will include the government and opposition members to write a constitution after the Syrian war and reject the way of election.
Moualem sets limits on the participation of the Syrian government in the commission, saying that the panel should keep "by looking at the new constitution articles," and cautioned against fraud.
Why does Trump have a second choice
In that sense, Mr. Trump can win a second election in 2020 unless, as many non-smokers may wish to be, he is unfaithful and has done something wrong that could take him away instead of being president.
Surely that will be the most historic conclusion in the history of the president!
To this day, there are no signs that the overseers are no longer concerned about the matter.
Since 2014, CNN viewers have again become 1.05 million and MSNBC viewers have tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News is often with 2.4 million viewers, from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Show" is headed by many 3.5 million viewers in hot night news.
"People are afraid of knowing because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama program called "Designed Survivor," which relates to the chairman or president after the attack under the Capitol.
Unell Scowell, who is red in the field of writing and creating mathematics called "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another view.
He remembers a box in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked.
"You said, 'cause you're kidding me,' said Mr. Scowell.
It is a pleasure to listen to and observe these parts.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether or not the arrivals are consistent and have a global economic situation.
Few people are aware of these facts.
Also, rather than that a knowledgeable citizen who finds himself sitting for more than six hours watching a science panel argues about the use of Bob Woodward's "deep background" source in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's hairdresser called $15,000 ("the most common clothing", says Washington Post) and the explicit words of St. Daniels update Mr. Trump.
I, just, will not look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Some of the things they do make it seem as though it's a life-sustaining program that you always give something at night," says Brent Montgomery, director of Wellhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pown Stars," talking about changing people's schedules and everyday conversations (circulation with N.F.L., blessing Kim Jong-un).

When I came to Mr. Fleiss in this church, he was hot at 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside the house overlooking the MSNBC where he had CNN.
It did not allow him to leave, as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court not to be confirmed.
"I remember in ancient times we made all these exciting arrangements and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was read, but it seemed to be true."

Money changers are set up in the middle of the House connection
It is not surprising that in the 17th and 17th centuries, money flows were received, due to the re-establishment of congresses and two managers in competition with the same board.
This newly revised Pittsburgh section is based on the movement of Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another special feature last year.
Lamb is still running with another conference, Republican Keith Rothfus, as he is currently representing the old region of the 12th Pennsylvania area, which is full of 17 new ones.
The maps were re-designed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts violated the principle of voting in the Republican.
The link between the 17th new fund campaign, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamb appeared in Pennsylvania after winning a special election on March that was attended by many people of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
This post was commissioned by the Republican for more than ten years, President Donald Trump won 20 points.
Politicians gave Democrats a measure of opportunity.
U.S. considered punishing El Salvador on behalf of China, becoming a Victim
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama branch marked Beijing, with a small petition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and became a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization management team.
The Heads of the State Department decide to call again the American diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the last decision to work with Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, who spoke at the door, at the beginning of this month.
But only El Salvador, with $140 million, has been paid by helping America in 2017, and by controlling drugs, improving and supporting the economy.
The tax paid, including the financial ban and the distribution of visa restrictions, could cause the country to feel pain in Central America because of increasing unemployment and death.
As their meetings progressed, North American and Central American leaders adjusted the high level of economic protection and development to follow the same association last year that was considered a step forward in the effort to prevent arrivals from entering the United States.
But during September, the senior executives made it clear that they wanted the capital to move forward, ending successfully any idea of paying El Salvador.
President Mike Pence's jealousy should now be prepared to speak with the summit, now scheduled to be in mid-October, as a sign to be taken by the leaders at the meeting, the officials say.
And three American representatives returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new strong messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House's speech refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two messengers, who agreed to discuss the internal intentions of the secret.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external editor close to the administrator and spoke of the state of secrets.
A Lesson in History
The following scenario may be a report by Robert Mueller's Special Adviser on Mr. Trump's justice.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign is compatible with Russia in its attempts to attack our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find it in the face of this issue, as he is preparing to stand before the people who will vote, and perhaps at the end of the trial.
This has many issues, and it does not even mean that Mr. Trump’s defeat will indeed take place in Europe.
There are decisions we both have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the debate.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up a cup d'état against Hitler, provided the West was against him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
History will be surrounded by such events, and endless efforts to fight the will of many will be either overwhelming or long - lasting.
The United States now faces many of these challenges.
What should we do if Mr. Trump was attacked by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controlled Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was still in trouble with this paper reporting that last year, he proposed a secret record of the president and spoke of his failure to do his job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the issue of The Times is not valid.
"How will we react if the new request by the F.B.I. of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite the charges of blasphemy and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the will of many will not last long.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish from Czechoslovakia who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once ruled my home.
He survived, he moved to America, and, after 60 years, he sent me to light the candles on the swastika table.
If I have the gift of death, how can I hope to live forever?'

Grangers' Graham Dorrans hopes as the game nears Rapid Vienna
Rangers play home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal this month, will give them a chance to pass on the Group G of Europe League.
The damage in the hole prevented the actor Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in pain until playing 2-2 and Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use those results to look forward to big things.
"It's good to get this point because Villarreal is a good game group," said the 31-year-old player.
"We're going to this game and we believe we're going to get something back and we got a point.
We may eventually find a ball but, besides, playing equally is good.
They played better than we did on our first horse and on our second horse.
On Thursday, we play another European game.
We hope that we will find three points but it will be a hard game because they play well in the past but, because our followers will encourage us, I am sure we will play and have good results.
The year has gone by, among other things, by my injuries and changes in the team itself, but it seems that things will be better now.
The group is good and the players are happy; it is also enjoyable when we are trained.
We hope that we will work now, and have passed through the affliction, and be able to endure it."
Women cannot sleep because they are afraid of financial problems
Despite having a clear view of how they want to be cared for, few people spoke to their families about it.
Nearly half of the people in the world’s research say that they talk to their mates about the long - term expenses of care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want the care of a family member, but they don't take steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the director of the life insurance company Naounde.
Let’s start with this.
Discuss with your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for the day if you do not share your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss how and where you will be cared for, for such decisions can have a great impact on your view of expenses.
Here is your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you to pay for those expenses.
Your long - term financial decisions may include a long - term insurance policy, a life insurance policy that provides money if you make it easier for yourself to pay these expenses or to become a health insurance if you still have money.
Fix your legal documents: Prevent legal battles.
Get a health - care program to set up a reliable person to look after your treatment and make sure that doctors cooperate with your wishes if you are not able to speak.
Also, consider the power of Antony in your money.
You will choose a trusted person to make decisions about your money and make sure that your expenses will be paid if you are not able to do anything.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is diagnosed with an acute health condition and is rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and drugs?
Write down those details in order to prepare for the situation.
"Not only money should be seen, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What trees?
Who will care for the sheep?
Get an existing program.

Government persecutors seek an unusual death sentence for the terrorist in NYC
Government activists in New York seek the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist who killed eight people -- an unusual sentence that has never been issued on this crime scene since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, is said to use the Home Depot's armored rifle to attack the West Side Highway on Lower Manhattan, killing people walking and riding bicycles in that way on Oct.
In order to get him executed, the persecutors will have to show that Saipov killed eight people "with intent" and "with intent" seriously injured them in the body, in accordance with an attempt to obtain a death sentence, published by the Southern District of New York.
Both of these actions have the voice of the execution of a death sentence, in accordance with a court document.
After a few weeks, the court of inquiry brought Saipov 22 cases involving eight murders, which were usually used by government prosecutors on organized criminal charges, and the rest of the cases and car arrests.
The attack required "good planning and thinking," the persecutors said, explaining how Saipov did "bad, cruel and offensive."
"U-Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov died yesterday from the murder of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pannucco," the judge said.
Five dead were visitors to Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York kept the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with killing two drug workers but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was issued in New York City in 1953 in July and Ethel Rosenberg, married people who were murdered after being convicted of joining the Soviet Union were informed between Cold War two years ago.
Both of the Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, shows that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to documents in court.
He told the police that he felt good about what he had done, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had done this to watch the ISIS videos on his face, in accordance with the words he spoke on the side.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, says the police.
And he said unto them, He that hath the hand of him that hath the right hand of him that hath the issue is on the side of him that hath the issue.
David Patton, a public defender representing Saipov, says they are "expected as expected" by a court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence is better than to accept an application for release from prison than the opportunity to be released will only make it easier for all concerned to be surprised," Patton said.
The Saipov Protection Group advised the persecutors not to want a death sentence.
Tory's governor says Nigel Farage should direct talks with Brazil
Nigel Farage swore to 'organize the army' today during the siege in the south of Tory.
Ukip's political leader said that the Eurosceptics needed to be "spilled" - as one of Theresa May's politicians said it should be him who would make talks with the EU.
A member of the parliament, Peter Bonne, told birmingham that the UK's 'was gone' now that Mr. Farage was a British scribe.
But Nkkz May’s challenge in bringing together members of his group from different ethnic groups is noted by the members of Tory’s senior members to join a different sect against the Brexit in this city.
The Chief failed to maintain his Chequers' recovery program despite the attacks of the members of Brazil, the Remainer and the EU.
Some members insist that he will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the conflict there — and force Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between his package 'and his orders'.
Munu Bone has a list of Leave Means Leave in Solihul that you want to 'end by Chequers'.
Mr. Farage said that he should be held in custody and given the task of communicating with Brussels.
'If it were the last one, then we're dead now,' he said.
The Wellingborough government has added: 'I'll stand for Brexit but we need to finish the Chequers.'
Describing his disagreement with the EU, he says: "We have not fought the world's wars to become slaves.
We desire that we may do the things we desire to do.
Mnu Bone comments that the public view has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The view that the British people have changed their minds and now wanted to remain completely in the truth.'
Andrea Jenkyns of Tory, who supports Brexit, is also in the shop, saying to the artists, "I say, "I'm great, listen to the people."
People don't want Chequers, the opposition group won't vote, our group doesn't want our people to see it on the streets and make us the first vote.
Please forget about Chequers and start listening.'
And in the same way, the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
Mr Farage told the government in the session that they should be 'pressed' if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now a matter of loyalty between us -- people and our political class,' he said.
They're trying to be unfaithful to Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we won't stop doing that.
In a powerful order he told the crowd, "I want to make political groups, now in the capital city of Brexit, feel oppressed.
"We use the army of the people of this country to defeat Braxit and we will not lose our strength and become a country of self-government, the United Kingdom of Great Britain."
Still, the Remainers settled in Birmingham before having a two - hour stay in the city.
The main drivers carried the Tories Against Brexit after the group was established in this week.
Labor member Lord Adonis has made a review of the Conservatives about the security problems they had with the group app when the site was opened.
'These people who tell us they can put the IT systems and all Canadian technology together, a safe range, trade abroad and Ireland,' he added.
'It's completely destroyed.
There's nothing called beautiful Brexit,' he added.
Warren's 'visual' settings for accessing presidential options
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says "to watch the president's election" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat talks about its future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was always critical of President Donald Trump, made the option of re-election in November against the GOP Rep. of the country's Geoff Diehl, who was the assistant of the Tromp's board in the 2016 Massachusts speech.
It has great opportunities to communicate with Trump in 2020.
The event on Thursday evening became his 36th meeting using a city hall since Trump became president.
The audience asked whether he was planning to join the election.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman who will be president."
The charged LSU player killed Sims
The Baton Rouge police, in La., announced that he had been arrested by a mature opponent who killed a basketball player who was listening to the LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested in the morning.
He released a video showing this on Friday, asking for help to describe the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the news about the End, 247 sport.
Wade says he's protecting his friend and Simpson's been shot.
Simpson was questioned and agreed that he was there, that he had a gun, and that he had killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trial and was locked up in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6-year-old boy in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games 10 times in a row last 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is near to find the earth’s surface after following the guidance of the team that defeated Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Walter Bottas succeeded in passing Lewis Hamilton on the conclusion that Mercedes team guidance would play a major role in this competition.
From the beginning, Bottas began well and almost agreed with Hamilton as he protected his place in the first two camps and invited Vettel to attack a member of his group.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton secure cars in the gang hall, which was to be decided.
Mercedes entered the pit after the rotation and became behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside unharmed after two years of protection in the third chamber.
Max Verstoppen began on the back line of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first cycle on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the competition as he continued his trips to insist on completing and passing Kimi Raikkonen on to fourth.
He finally reached the pits in the 44th cycle but could not raise his jaws in the eight remaining circles as Raikkonen fell fourth.
It was a hard day because Walter did a good job every week and was kind and kind to me.
The group has done a commendable job to have 1-2," Hamilton says.
The Splendor of His Body Is Rich
President Donald Trump scoffed at Senator Diane Feinstein's conclusion as he insisted that he did not show someone a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing High Court prosecutor Brett Kavanaugh of criminal offences.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, rather, he noted that what happened to the Senate showed that people were "not considerate and unmerciful and unfaithful."
"One thing that can continue to be a good thing a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and unkind and unreasonable and unfaithful," he said.
"When you look at the funny news and say, "Oh, I didn't.
I couldn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, is there someone here?
You remember his answer... there's someone who sent this document-- "Oh, oh, yeah?
Oh, Dad.
I have not sent a man.
All right, wait a minute.
We've sent him...Cha, we haven't sent anyone," he said, referring to the senator.
Feinstein was sent a detailed letter about Kavanaugh's accusation by Ford back in July, and it came from early September - but Feinstein objected to the fact that the document came out of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's complaints, I didn't send someone," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as soon as he asked me."
But his opposition to the president was not well heard, which he noted during the final meeting at night: "What I don't say, his body's spread is rich.
It may not be that he has done it, but the blasphemy of his body is with the rich."
Continued to protect the Supreme Court prosecutor, accused by three women in a mock manner, the president said Democrats used the charges for their profits.
"He's not willing to fight for power for anything he can do.
You see the lack of kindness, indifference, who doesn't care who's hurt, who should pass on to them and control them," reports the Mediate according to the president's statement.
Y-Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer spent two Ginants playing with Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned powerful after the fifth hit on the Elite League and the Belfast Giants win the next 5-3 Dundee game on the final.
The Giants found two balls at the beginning of the game by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie played the weight of the team he played at home before Dwyer played the third of the Giants.
François Bouchard plays the Dundee match before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen plays two winballs.
This was the third group of Adam Keefe being eaten at the Elite League in the day, since they had returned to the hospital on Friday night and fought Dundee on 2-1 in Belfast.
These groups had met the fourth in the day, and the Giants won three games last.
Dwyer's first ball went into four minutes at 3:35 at the time the ball was installed from Calendar McFaull, where David Rutherford put the ball when Beauvillier hit the second ball four minutes later.
In a game many years earlier, Sullivan gave hope to a group that played at home at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt sent a ball to Cownie when he played it at 15:16.
Dwyer has made sure the Giants move forward when they are thrown into the cabin when he hits his second ball that day at the end of the first ball.
The group he played at home was strong again and Bouchard replayed the good golf course at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have met to help Nielsen play the goal of the first Dundee race at the end of the second round and made sure they win the game by playing the fifth if you finish the game.
The Giants, now in their last four five games, play home with Milton Keys in their next game on Friday.
The Air Force Dies to Save Hundreds of People From Earth’s End
The Indonesian flight guide is honored after death to ensure that a large number of people arrive safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have not been found after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, the beginning of tsunami.
There is a powerful campaign that continues to attack this place and many have been locked up by two in the city of Palu.
But even though their brothers had fled to rescue them, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave work in a building that was under the control of Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu County.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, on the way, would be able to leave safely.
Then he jumps out of the air control building while he thinks we are resting.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Jones Sirait, said this decision could save hundreds of people, reports Australia's ABC News.
We have prepared a safe plane from the Balikapan in Kalimantan to take her father to a hospital in another town.
The ship was now in the middle of the night, and he was sleeping on the other side.
"Our hearts are sad to hear about this," he added.
During that time, authorities feared that the number of dead could reach thousands as the scientist who helped in this disaster says it was not easy to enter the towns of Donggar, Sigi and Botong.
"We believe that the number of deaths continues to rise as many bodies are below the threshold when many cannot reach them," said scientist Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The gases reached six meters below Palu will have a funeral for many people on Sunday.
Airplanes and transportation bring relief and life’s necessities.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: A minute and a minute the ambulance carries the bodies.
Clean water flows slowly.
Markets are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the Red Cross world in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia helps survivors but we don't know they'll find me there.
This is already the calamity, but it will be yet more."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday, and told the army, "I ask you all to work day and night, so that you may complete the mission on the release of the people.
Ready? save CNN.

Aeronautics in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after an aircraft crash in the lanoon
The airline directing a higher plane in the Pacific goon in Micronesia now says that there is only one person who is missing, after all 47 passengers and aircraft crew are safely hidden in a floating plane.
Air Niugini has been at the end of the night, unable to tell a story about a man-man runner.
The airline says it also works with local authorities, hospitals and sailors to try to find the treasure.
The airline did not respond immediately when asked to reveal details about this pilot, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships help other passengers and workers after flying over the water while trying to cross the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, seven officials were sent to the hospital.
The airline says 6 passengers remain in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in a bad mood.
What caused the plane crash and how this occurred is not clear.
The airline and U.S. Navy are both able to fly a long-distance flight to the airport.
Some Witnesses think that the plane is crossing the road.
American pilot Bill Jaynes says he flew into the water at a low speed.
"That's really good," said Jaynes.
Janes says he and others have been able to travel to the safe water and go to the emergency exits on a busy plane.
He told the flight attendants to call and speak, and that he was feeling a little hurt at his head.
U.S. Navy says nearby pilots also do not know when people are released using a steaming boat to get to the harbor before flying 30 metres of water (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died at the elevation of PNG-registered Airlines over the past 20 years but does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst describes the night of a woman burned alive
The attacker accused a man of being burned by a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explains to a group of janitors how he used his forced records to find places where a 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, died on the night he died.
Rowlett said he found details about the location in a number of opinions showing that Tellis had Chambers died last night, contrary to what he had said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When details show that his cell phone was in Chambers during the time he had your friend; hey Michael Sanford, the police are going to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Judgment and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the persecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's cell that night, Sanford said, "they laughed because his room was in Nashville."
One thing is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
The genealogical records indicate that they differed in one week.
Rowlett says some time before the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chamber's messages, telephones and contact details.
"He took it out of his life," said Hale.
The defendant was ordered to start talking about the Church.
The judge is expected to take the case to the judge’s congregation that day.
High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
This hip hop group wants to challenge negative views about this type of music by filling its songs with encouraging words.
High Breed, from Bristol, says the hip hop is no longer what it was at first because it has political messages and talks about public problems.
It requires a return to the tools and a conscious hip hop is also popular.
Singers such as The Fugees and the Common have later seen an increase in the UK in musicians such as Acala and Lowkey.
Is there someone here who is blind?
He loves a kid in NY who blames his parents for taking him away with a message that shows "extraordinary"
She loves a child in New York to blame a husband and wife for taking her away from him with harsh words after receiving a message from the mother of a child who is not wrong about "that's not another ugly person."
The parents deny that they have prejudices, saying that it is motivated by "in order to earn money."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expresses concern when he finds out that he will hire his little child, Giselle Maurice, a deaf man when he arrived on his first day to work in 2016.
"NoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OF THE WORLD," wrote Nkkz Plasco-Flaxman writing to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent Nksz. Maurice, twice.
After seeing his manager, Plato-Flaxman took Nksz. Maurice, who said that he was bringing up his children who wanted to go, African-American, did a bad job and that he was expecting a Filipino man, according to the New York Post.
Nksz. Maurice was paid one day's work and moved home by Uber.
Now, Maurice blames her parents for misappropriating her, and she's looking for a $350 bill for six months, and a live-in gig she's got, without the counter.
"I wanted to show you that, look, it was done," said the Post on Friday, adding "I know you're a traitor."
The parents replied that they were prejudiced, saying that she was a good woman, and they feared that they would not trust her after she had been treated badly.
"My wife sent him something he didn't understand to say.
He did not.
We don't see people passing by," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But can you leave your children with a man who is a leper, or even a virgin?
Has your child recently found it?
Kahleni."
Comparing this to “the profit of getting money,” he says his wife has spent two months bringing up the child and "in a very difficult situation."
"Will you attack such a man?
It's not good at all," the investment banker adds.
As the case goes on, the court of open - mindedness is quick to condemn these parents in connection cases, not encouraging what they have done.
Paddington’s printers feared that students would not like this file they were talking about, published the newspaper
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was loved, said in a book, "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of the first person you read before it was printed.
It is a pleasure to know now what we know about Paddington's success."
He says his father, who worked in the BBC as a photographer before being moved to write a book about a small movie ball, would not be happy if his job was not appreciated, added 60th anuniversary of his books was "soon and fun" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which he described as "the virtue of our most important family," he added that his father was not worthy of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud," she told them.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had a child doing something: you're proud of it even if it wasn't you.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Even if it was his first and thought of him, he was looking forward to Paddington."
My daughter is pregnant and I have to call her
When his daughter is waiting for surgery at Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, the doctors are working hard to save her life.
"Nad was always on the phone saying it was too bad, waiting to save," said Nkkz Ednan-Laperouse.
"I've got a call from Nad saying you're gonna die in two minutes since now and I've had to hide it from her.
And I made up my mind.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, please.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Doctors gave him the keys to keeping his heart steady to the limit of his weight and to the end of his body.
He died some time earlier, and this had stopped working.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all of this had happened.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally Nkkz Ednan-Laperouse, now listening to his dead daughter, flew off the plane with other passengers — apparently because of her sad situation.
"No one knew," he told them.
"I looked down, and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's time I escaped when I hurt Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how he loved me."
A woman picks up cards to prevent suicide in a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in death work together to prevent others from killing them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have become this appeal to the Welsh bloc with encouraging words and phone numbers that people can use to get help.
Nksz Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," says Nksz Davis.
Nksz Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cooker and that when everyone was asleep in the car.
"All people knew about her smile.
And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising of the dead should mean.
Still, he quit his job before he died, as he was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, became the first to find him after his suicide.
Nksz Davis said, "I'm always worried that something like this will happen."
Nksz Davis began making cards, "to let people know that there are people who can talk to them, even if they can be friends.
Don't hide your feelings - you have to talk."
Nksz Humphreys, a friend of Nksz Davies for many years, was killed by Mark, his 15-year-old master, just after his mother died.
"He never said he felt down or depressed or said something," she relates.
"Just a few days before Christmas we noticed the different way he did things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was under another way - when children open their gifts he didn't see them before or do anything."
And he said unto them, The hour is come, that ye should enter into it.
It brings great pain to us.
But we must all continue to fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain as the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought, if we could actually find something like the one they were looking for -- a quick, small - could bring a close agreement," said Mr. Flake on the conclusion, adding that he feared that the committee would "distribute within" as many supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do an investigation?
The result is time.
The internal elections will be held in five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the failure of the Republicans, then will be weakened in their efforts to find a person who is elected to the highest court in this case.
George W. Bush kept calling the senators, encouraging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House who worked for Mr. Bush and where he met his wife Ashley, who was a writer of Mr. Bush.
What happened when the FBI removed its report?
There will be a Senate election, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get about 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to divide the balance and put him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'reduced' under Kim
The number of refugees in North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the details of the Southern port of assembly, says last year there were 1,127 faces - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says that border laws have been established between North Korea and China and the high costs required for workers entering the population are high.
Pyongyang didn't notice anything in society.
A large number of refugees from the North continue to enjoy the rights of people in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally beaten since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, with a long border with North Korea and easier to escape than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with security between two Koreans.
China views these clouds as illegal arrivals rather than refugees and often returns them to their countries with force.
The relationship between the North and the South and the present in the war has developed significantly over the past months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of these two countries had met in Pyongyang mainly on the establishment of nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a number of ways to work to eliminate nuclear weapons in Korea.
But in conclusion, North Korean Foreign Government Ri Yong-ho has not taken action since then.
"Unless the US trusts, there will be no security in our country and under those circumstances, we will never close our arms ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelois calls Brett Kavanaugh "control of feelings," which is not suitable for the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Small House Group Nancy Pelosi called the one that might be elected by the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as "control of emotions" said and his feelings did not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelois says these words in the debate at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I had thought that if a woman had done this way, it would be said 'to be controlled by feelings'," said Pelois in his reply to the words of Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has rejected the feeling that you have called Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in her early years.
Among his first words, Kavanaugh expressed his feelings, one of his favorites and admiring his time talking about his family and his high school years.
He once again deplored the Democrats on the committee, calling for the alleged "study of human knowledge in an organized way to kill" organized by people who were accused of having Hillary Clinton split up in the 2016 election.
Pelois believes that the evidence of Kavanaugh shows that he will fail to work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is against the Democrats.
"I think you're making a mistake about those words and how he spoke about Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelois refused when asked if he could try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was arrested, and that the Democrats found many seats at the House of Representatives.
"What I'm going to say -- if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, it means not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court as it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh as a lawyer at D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as Democrat he is concerned that Kavanaugh may decide against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is thought to be the next judge.
When asked, Kavanaugh did not answer any questions about whether he could answer certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a person to be controlled by feelings, who takes the side to court and is expected to say, 'It was good,' says Pelois.
And women need to use their strength.
Proper speech, months, and years of summer harvest, and there is no other way to separate it from weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," Nunksz. Steinem told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal. What do you say?"
He added, "I was very helpful to the woman who was trying to tell you, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she received a suggestion that when she was angry and cried, she would say to the person who spoke to her, "You might think I was wrong because I am crying.
I'm mad."
Then he went on.
And I thought that it was good.
Tears come out as a way to relieve anger because they are desperately in need of people.
One of my memories of my first job, a full - time male office, when I found myself crying because of a plant that I could not explain, I was dragged by a stick in the middle of my wheelchair that I could not always carry.
"Tell me they never see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're mad at you.
They thought that he had been sick for a long time, and that they wanted to find him.
Patricia Schroeder, who became a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the time of his election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on board a ship called the Monkey Business and was released from option, Unksz. Schroeder, very angry, he realized that he would not do his wish to join the election as president.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said to me 30 years later.
"There are already seven others in the competition, and the cleaning thing is waiting for another one.
One calls it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it would end the campaign, he didn't have the money to advertise, so he promised he wouldn't get in the competition and have a million dollars.
It was a war I could not win.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 to men could give him 250.
"Do they think I'm getting help?" he asked himself.
When he announced that he would not make an organized campaign, he was seized with feelings of appreciation for those who had supported him, disappointed by the scholarship that made it difficult for him to get the money and to seek people to vote for him instead of seeking members, and anger over the abuse of women he had taken.
"You don't think I'm going in," recalls Nksz. Schroeder and how reporters responded to him.
"You don't think Klenex will be a cop.
Do I remember thinking, ‘ Will they put me in my grave? ’
"Have you been?"
How the US-China trade war can be beneficial in Beijing
Salvos opening up a trade war between the US and China closed ears, and since the war is far from over, dialogue between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, says experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, issued the first warning early this year by printing goods sent to China, including electric panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest event in this week is the new currency that affects the cost of $200 billion (£150 billion), by printing the share of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has repeated each time in the same way, recently placed five to ten cents of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has asked to be equal to the U.S. and the second largest economy in the world has little chance of being nearing you.
Making Washington clean and clean meant hiding in the kitchen for its needs, but the public engagement of the U.S. could be very shameful to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Nevertheless, researchers say that if Beijing can act wisely, the pressure of the U.S. trade can be won by China for a long time by slowing down the trade between these two economies.
"The fact that an immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic problems in both countries is more dangerous than what observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an Asian-based researcher in Central for New American Security, a mental area.
Syria's 'preparing' refugee return, says the Foreign Government
Syria says it is ready to return voluntarily to refugees and needs help to rebuild a country that has been hit by a seven-year war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem says that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in this is going to be calm and safe because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government also continues to repair places that have been exposed to the dangers in order to restore normal life.
All situations now allow the refugees to return voluntarily to a land where they had to flee because of the threat and economic laws that threaten their daily lives and the way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian refugees have fled since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Some six million people still live in this area need the help of living things.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian government can enjoy helping to rebuild a war-affected country.
But he stressed that they would not accept help with matters or help from countries that supported rebellion.

He sends work to his man John Ram, who defeated the U.S. soldier Tiger Woods on 2&1 and played alone on Sunday.

US captain Jim Furyk has spoken after his group's bad game, "I'm proud of our players, they're working.
There is a time in the morning when we have to put up with Europe.
We failed.
You have used Thomas.

A new report from Florida Fish and the Wildlife Commission shows a reduction in Red Tide numbers in the Tampa Bay sections.
According to the FWC, the product difference is reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasoto, Charlotte and Collier regions — which may indicate a decrease in numbers.
The production of Red Tide grows about 130 feet west from the north of Pinellas to the southern part of Lee.
The difference is found almost 10 miles from the Hillsborough County border, but in a few places more than in the past weeks.
Red Tide has also appeared in the Pasco County.
