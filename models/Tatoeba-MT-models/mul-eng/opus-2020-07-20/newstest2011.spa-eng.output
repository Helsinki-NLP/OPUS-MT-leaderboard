What is it? The ČSSD in Prague does not know either Voldemort or the pastry
The new councils of the ČSSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious linguistic barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the municipal council to understand their renewed partners of the ODS.
The current period "examined" to the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition were ruling Prague.
The codified speaker who used Prague's blossom and political birth during the previous period, named Pavel Bém, includes some of the most known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been verified that the new councils do not nearly understand those known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I am rather a new in Prague's politics," said the Culture Council Lukáš Kaucký during the review of the terminology of "collegeo".
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Brézina reacted equally.
Maybe they know the concept of golf.
"Maybe it's the only expression of all you asked me to use once in a while."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper Aktualnë.cz last June before the ODS vote, the edition selected six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
Sociologists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "major Prague golf today", "to the pastry", "to the bull's wedding", "to the capital" and "to the blind".
Three council members agreed to submit to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague, at first joined, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth council, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't put myself in these things, nor do I want to appreciate how democracies have fun."
"What matters to me is how we will understand the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, it is likely that the councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have been aware that the previous title was an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of the ex- mayor Bém, Roman Janousek.
Kaucký's word "Voldemort" has nothing to say to him; the only term that was found in the review is "the biggest golf course in Prague".
"It's the Blanca tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know better about the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," smiles.
Karel Brézina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf course the Blanca tunnel, but also the Mediterranean Environment Concealer Lukáš Plachy.
Then, both socio-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even know where to find that character; they also suspect the meaning of "go to the pastoral".
"I think I want to go to a company in Prague"; it is soon discovered in Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
Like Brézina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the trial, among the socio-democrats there is no such family glossary of local terms.
"I asked my friends, but it really seems we have nothing like it."
"Well, among us we use apologies, sometimes abbreviations or games with names," said the president of the ČSSD pragensee, Petr Hulinský, whose partymates call Hulda.
"In the college they called me Bríza, but I don't know if my friends also call me that," he confides in his own support, Karel Brézina.
The current.cz journal has tested the number and works.
For his partymates, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yyo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("visio"), the representative of Miroslav Poche, who was associated before the false elections during the party's patronage, receives the support of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his companions.
The contributions are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in the speech within the party.
Hulínský doesn't like to call him Hulda, but the newspaper Actualní.cz also discovered other clues to this president pragense.
"The doctor of the rights of the porpoise" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "brujas", as published in a booklet
Women considered to be virgin in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They often have advanced age, they cannot work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
Women who "return" noises are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer so much."
"It is also not easy for healthy young women, because they help in their work and have children," explains a Monja who, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, cares for a special residence of more than a hundred women displaced from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information paper that should help to avoid the hunting of bears.
However, this has a trap.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," warns Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of sensitization by writing.
Bribery allegations are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, last week, 72-year-old Amy Hemmah died when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was taken into the oil used for ritual ceremonies.
He was called when the group wanted to "remove the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "brujas" supports people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted 42-year-old Burkina Faso as saying: "Human souls destroyers always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to pacify the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his uncle, launched a broad hunt of bears which, of course, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To help you, I call on near Guinea that, protected by the president's police, military and personal hearing, men and women elected randomly among the Gambian peoples to the ownership of the president in Kanila," the Amnesty International said in his report.
In the end, arrested people had to drink a bottle of herbs with alucinogen effects, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrests did not survive the stay in the castle.
After international pressure, about a thousand prisoners were finally released.
The inhabitants of Balala: warms with carbon bars and sign a higher rent
The man, advanced and recognizable, crossed the doors of the centre of care to the customer of the company RPG Byty of the "Curbone Magnate" Zdenjek Bakala, the largest private owner of rooms in renting in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm he carried documents with the new leases of three floors: his wife, his daughter, and his son, who is executing judgment.
The three of them just took advantage of the liberalisation of the renters.
Instead of 3,500 Czech Korunas per month, the child will pay from the next year 4,100 crowns for a two-stage flat with a separate kitchen of second category.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," shows the man with his finger in his son's new contract, on which the firm has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains the angry medium, the designated medium.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which has qualified the new terms of rent as "unjust and inaccurate", recommends that residents who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, the date on which a guide will be published informing them of how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, the man only makes an adman.
"Everything says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of proof of liberalisation.
After the New Year it will take place with the great majority of the rooms that, in the Czech Republic, were still under a regulated rent.
Therefore, currently.cz decided to visit the "laboratorio" in person.
The RPG mineral waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Just next to the doors are security guards and on their side a machine to pick up the number.
"Aquiler 2011" can be read in a light button of your touch screen.
When you push it, get out of the machine a paper with a number.
It almost doesn't give time or read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're on the hill.
Shortly thereafter, an advanced age marriage comes to be asked, but the majority of the room is not here by the new renters.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: arrangements requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will reach Ostrava to the boroughs of the inhabitants of most 44,000 RPGs around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in the rent from 15 to 38% in the cards.
On 18 November a special window was opened at the customer centre for new rentals.
"It's working a week, so it's starting," they answer, after a short doubt, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and old blocks for Balala miners are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of Parliament, original of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of ČSSD, had already addressed them high and clear, and are now constantly appearing in the newspapers of the area.
"Seven years later, I want a new soil."
"I didn't change the damn floor of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction was disappointed.
According to the workers, they are currently more than young to check if they receive a discount in the rent if they sign in time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the rental of February for the remaining inhabitants who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the "liberalization" window of mine is undoubtedly not able to dissipate the avalanche of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked about the rent in 2011 about forty or fifty people," estimates the fan.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties fail to reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge shall resolve the matter.
"It is not a threat, but information on the only way to proceed as possible and as fully as possible according to the law," warns the RPG on its pages.
"There's no one going to judge here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who's on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives him at least part of the reason.
"I get 13,000 pensions and leave 5,000 for food; I don't have any means to attend the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee seems to have doubts.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community's fund," recalls Pavel Klimestes, director of the RPG Byty's residential map, who adds that the state of the community's fund that is focused on the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could invest four billion in apartments, the figure will increase to 5,200 million in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen that hangs from the roof, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that are highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 in a 15% and less applies to 3.1200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be as much as 7,50 monthly Czech crowns per square metre," says the screen.
Only increase in 38% of the 400-piece rental of the RPG card.
"In such cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19.66 square metres of crowns," says the RPG.
In 2,600 rooms, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not affect the renters, but will scale between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent uptake (see the chart) again in the rooms, mainly in heating storage: new windows and heating.
Those who sign the contract of departure shall have priority.
The architects have understood that offices also need storage.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that he would also hide in his interior a small garden with everything he owns at such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a mini park in the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can visit her.
The company of architectural projects Arch.Design, whose studio came out of a number of buildings known as Brno, thought from the first sections of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its ministry.
About 90 people work in the company, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the store is one of the benefits that Arch.designs its employees under its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the opportunity to combine a required profession with the care of children.
The Ministry was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the Directorate, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's ministry is financed through the European Social Fund under the operational programme for human and employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a provision of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy equipment and, after two years, qualified staff and services.
When funding is completed (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain the Ministries with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the submission of the funding application contributed to the Economic Rating company.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, they are present every day for their care by a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The care of children is currently available to children with no age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
As this is a "miniguardary", it is only possible to accommodate a maximum of five children at the same time, although with shifts there are more during the day.
The maintenance function is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers with the same right to use the guard, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the Ministerial Programme is comparable to the regular pre-school education programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic education to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class not only has games and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of collecting late school children when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support for the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. They observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like a prehistoric lamp, the stairs remember the column of a dinosaur, and the balconys look like the mouth of an open piece.
This is the Batlló House, Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its appearance similar to that of a skeleton, the locals supported her "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its callative colors, the innovative use of stone, the fragments of steel and mosaics, a façade that reminds of smoothly curved scales and omnipresenting lines, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's section.
The courtyard of the house plays with unique lines, delicate colors and textures derived from nature and fashion.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order are observed.
During the night, the whole face of the house seems even more impressive, since it is lit in such a way that the brightness of the colors improves.
Serpentea and the torture of the forms continue to surprise us also inside it.
The undulated wood copies the frames of the windows, the bathrooms, the doors decorations, the mirrors and the letters.
The Batlló House, which is located in the Eixample village at number 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig de Gracia, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Joseph Batlló, initially insisted on breaking down the previous building and starting from zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, formed by several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Joseph María Jujol worked in the design.
In fact, in its plans of the project, ornaments arose for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
Other artists and artists also work on the façade.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milá House and the Güell park of Gaudí, where other parts of the same are found.
Because of its organic shape, the locals soon after their finalization supported her "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism of the windows, began to call it "the house of the woods".
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of San Jorge, the patron of Catalunya, appears.
Other sculptory elements of construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudí designed a unique system at home for the central heating period with ventilation breaths and typical chemicals.
It can result in a strange orientation of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not fully respect the construction standards of the time and did not allow them to be influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction obtained the relevant permission from the beginning, although it clearly contained the data indicated on the planned reconstruction was so vague that, two years after its completion, the assembly was so affected by the result it requested to be corrected.
For example, he worried that construction would include columns even to the public eye.
The arrangements have never been made, but otherwise: only five days after the application, Joseph Batlló requested (and received) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself was installed in the lower rooms.
In the gallery of the second floor was the living room and in the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The bottom floor was rented to a jewellery.
The house, of six floors, is completely surrounded by a ladder that leads to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform were to break all the right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be contacted in this manner without neglecting the privacy required for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only received a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It also results in amazing ways to play Gaudí with light, white blues and blues that cover the interior floor and back.
The game with the two colors brings the maximum light in all the rooms of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which was added in 2005 to the World Heritage List of the United Nations.
At the first floor of the house is the spaciousst and most recharged apartment of public accessors.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
Visits confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very useful business and extended visits to the common area and the garden, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of entry to the monument is not significant, it reaches €16.50, although students, young people and tourists receive a 20% discount.
The amount exceeded significantly the price of the entry of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the true bed environment with its lagarto towers, you should make friends quickly from a neighboring house and visit you at home.
How to choose the pick and summer: Women and Men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumped frame for the bed; what really entrusts its quality to a good bed is the surface to melt, i.e. the roof and the summer.
First of all, perfection must be complemented in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election many elements enter into play, including weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which the roof and summer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cab that does not usually have heat, latex drops should not be used because they "heat" slowly.
In addition, they often weigh considerably more than normal polyurethane shells.
Therefore, it is necessary to give them the most frequent return.
If the channels of the centre are not properly aired and, above, they are located on a solid base, they keep in moisture. They may even appear low.
At the time of choosing a bed, the customs are also influenced.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high handle with a thin layer and will have problems to feel good on a lower and longer surface.
"Almost all hockey players who returned from NHL complained that they didn't sleep well here."
"For his machaced hombres, talons and chandeliers, they needed beds with a blizzard layer of viscoelastics."
"This type of cough is also recommended for people with diabetes who have time problems with the nervous system, so they get the information from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Haddamčikova, who specializes in the received furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, take time preferring viscoelastic hooks.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropical brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player to appreciate viscoelastics anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat or adapt to your body heat.
There is no pressure; during the night, it will not give back as after a hard game.
I just feel better.
Viscoelastics also serve as protection against needles.
By choosing the size of the neck, added to its height the length of its feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, of 90 cm, total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, e.g. singles, it is recommended as minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: when the mouth is above, it should have the hands quietly attached to the codes," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu čalouníkó in Decoratorí, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject taught in specialized schools for many years.
In the double rooms, each needs its own summer and harvest, so during the purchase, attention must be paid to combine the height of the hills.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the shadows at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Spum hooks should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with a minimum of 15 cm of wood, of which at least three centimetres are for the layer that adapts to shape and softness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you settle down in the barn, you should certainly not notice the women," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each collection requires a particular type of shade.
The fully-encumbered bedrooms, in which the roof and base are like symmetries, do not make sense in the bedroom.
The bones breathe badly and cannot wash their foundation, which is often done today.
And since each night we cross between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sugar, it's clear that after about five or seven years the harvest will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) tams.
For this reason, specialists reject the slogans that speak of a life of up to 25 years of age or, even, of a life-saving guarantee.
However, everything has a pen.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: in the hills with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the ground, but better add a shelter that can easily be removed and washed.
Although it is currently made up of shells with cremary closures throughout its perimeter, so when opening them are in two parts (something very important for washing and washing size!), its manipulation in the larger models (and by one person) when raising the bucket may seem a struggle between a muscle weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a summer, do you have a firm table?
Never!
How much for the beds thought to spend one night visiting.
However, you must make (if you don't have them) ventilating orifice on the table and you must be used with a mixture of insiders and a minimum height of 15 cm with bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a thin layer.
Polyuretane gloves should not be used on such bases.
For non-articular laminates and containing between 14 and 18 laminates, latex or sandwich shells (for example, a latex combination and coconut fibre) may be used, although it is always better a somme with a larger number of laminates, 28 or more, in which laminates in the lamp area are strengthened and their rigidity can be regulated.
Articulable laminants should not be used with a mixture of honey, since it does not respond to recycling.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the laminates, the protection of homs can also be used.
It is a special fixation of laminates that enables pressure or, even, to tilt the laminates so as to "rode" perfectly to the males during the sleep.
For men who have very broad limbs, it's very important.
They are even agreed upon by the coal manufacturers who, in the "masculins", began to use a more dense area exactly around the men.
Women are also remembered, for which they place a softer area around the floor.
For the most demanding customers, there are shades with cross-structured or tables with the so-called multi-torn amortization.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is reduced.
It should also be borne in mind that, while using the roof and the suitable shade, if it uses a bad breakfast (large and "mutley"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the stomach must support the head and the skin can only reach the bones, so that the muscles of the same person can relax.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
At the top of the side, the softness must be at the same level (when combined with the summer with strength for men or the softest area of the neck) than the height of the shoulders.
Modern beads have something to look at, it seems, with the original beads filled with leaves.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, the biological shells are fashionable.
The raw materials based on petroleum, with which the polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biologically, in the case of hills, means that the centre is made only of natural materials," explains Petr Vasíček of Tropico Plus.
In addition, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the base of the bones, one of the first true aloes.
But you can also choose by microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or laundry.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshed" with vegetative spray extracts, so that the bottom of the neck absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the bottom.
Red paint extract improves the circulation of blood, so that women feel more warm.
Do you like them right now?
The frozen stems, which are more porous, with an adaptable cell structure, make them more legible than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam rigidities allows the manufacture of hooks from different areas that know perfectly where the head, the shoulders and the knees go.
A good catch will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function often have a lower VAT, since they are considered health means.
The first one I got this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to save in the hills and summers.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which at times offer two cookies at the price of one.
For example, the brand Magniflex offers Duofreze dolls with a shoulder with memory attached to the base for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The age of viscoelastics with an open cell structure and a great density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
Initially, it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the disappearances, astronomers were subjected to huge overloads.
Time is absorbed with heat and is frozen with cold.
The human body, therefore, is warm, has a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid needles, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only in the joints, but also for sanitary products, for example, for apples placed under the legs and alivians, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use people's tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally intended for the tracking of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a cell box, but soon it will be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to learn about the means available to better protect their children.
Even it cost him his privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices may be abused, for example if they are placed in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we haven't met them yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his view, children should always know what "cajita" is for and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočkova warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to take it, he'll just throw it away.
"Even small children show great creativity when they lose intentionally certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"In the past, parents had enormous trust in mobile phones, but they could easily disappear as easily as the tracking device," Bočková says.
In its opinion, it is controversial whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared dryer, the author will virtually always check whether the child is carrying any type of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the use of tracking devices is extended, you will also look for them, as their sales will no doubt be made with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, add that such devices can help in the event of an improvised attack on a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence may be helpful.
"You can configure the device to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If damages occur, at least it will facilitate the last person's position on the matter."
"The most expensive devices are integrated with an inhaler, so if the person is simply re-reimbursed and is in motion, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Czech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which a special software is to be installed.
The problem with the current tracking units is that devices are currently dealing with a size similar to a cell box or mobile phones of a smaller size.
So they can lose.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"What identifies him after a certain time, which can make the police spend time," he adds.
Although tracking devices are carried into the mill or hold, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for the monitoring of vehicles.
It is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mice like to round all the Chequia, but only for two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of mecha to take explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added its 224-kilometre sword to its arsenal.
Therefore, they are existing for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the mouse is two years, four to the sum.
The army bought the knife for explosives to the STV Group, a.k.a. forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha, saying that the soldiers needed 60 kilometres of mecha training a year.
According to the calculation of the army's pyrotechnics, with which it was contacted MF DNES, it is decided that, in that case, all senior officers, including secretaries and cleaners should carry out such operations with frequent use of explosives every year.
They did not want exemptions from either the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vundr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek Army.
Only that way could be justified is that the army spends 60 kilometres of mecha.
That length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
However, the army would have sufficient existences for more than ten years.
On the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional to reach a maximum of two metres, the army would have with the new purchase (including by adding the consumption of engineering or special units) sufficient existences for the 225 specified above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally shortly before Minister Vondra because they say they only have ammunition for various weapons, so they are limited even to shooting practices for money.
And we're not talking about the lack of inner clothing.
"I also can't understand that we are repeatedly able to understand such amounts of butter."
"But it's your decision and they'll know why they're doing this."
"For us, the army is a good customer to which, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits STV Group's commercial director, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek also defends hundreds of miles of mecha saying that he will have the existence of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of STV Group, indicates that the mouse has only one useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, for two years.
"If it is stored under perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one soldier who, because of the possible criticism of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains faithful and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometres of mecha, I received a discount.
"We were 60 per cent less than last year's request of 244 kilometres," said the spokesman Pejszek from the Ministry of Defence's shopping center.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminates the munitions of World War II or left by the Soviet army, is no longer more than 1,500 metres ago.
Moreover, the police always only ask for the right amount as to complete the ammunition before it ends its useful life.
They decided it for security reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, they can achieve more modern and reliable types of mix.
The Ministry has already had clear difficulties ending tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czech army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who spoke with MF DNES, after a few years the following problem will occur with the current: it will have to be removed from hundreds of miles of old, which is now being purchased "barata".
I still live from the contacts I received thanks to the competition.
The fact of winning the "Employer of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the "Employer of the Year" competition by 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun de Liberec.
Your success story looks like a movie.
And Luke Pytloun was a pleasant trip.
Foreigners were aware that Liberec lacked quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he had collected with steady work abroad, and a bank credit he bought a house that was half ruined made of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was truly valuable.
"At present, the quality-precious relationship of accommodation in our area moved me to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first building for foreign workers.
All the income he received again inverted in the building, which gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has been able to open little by little in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the entrepreneur number one of the last year.
"This sale of licences for the opening of hotels helped greatly to win the competition of the 'Emprey of the Year'," adds grateful Python.
The victory increased its fame and popularity in Liberec and around.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant," she recalls.
No doubt, it recommends that all the world try to take part in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that he is still living with contacts and knowing that, without the competition, he may not have received it.
"With some people I met with thanks to the competition I've started to work with normally."
The fame associated with success, in its opinion, also included employees,
in total about seventy.
"I have seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that has gained general recognition."
"It's not, not much less, my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It's only my name that appears on the first plane," says the modest Lukáš Pytloun today.
My successor wants you a year more quiet than we've had in Farmet
The euphoria for victory was soon divided by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the firm Farmet, Karel Žðárský, received the first prize in the final edition of the Vodafone competition "Empresa del year", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he was able to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a volume of hundreds of millions of businesses.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and improved our confidence in combating competition," said the winner of last year.
The story of the firm Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Žžárský the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not doubt too much; he gave up his position in the company in which he worked and, with a few associates, founded the company with his father of plastic bags.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetal oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic press in central Europe.
They also gained greater presence among the non-specialized public after success in the competition in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to view the Farmet brand as significantly better, but foreign partners also began to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country," says Karel Žðárský.
Last year maybe Farmet wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory.
It also received recognition for the commercial results until 2008 and, in part, for 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for machine sales.
The deterioration of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, has caused companies to stop their investment projects and start to limit the purchase of new machinery or technologies.
"Of course, we are not free from this situation either."
"The income decreased by a 40%, we had to limit production and even had some delays," explains Karel Žðárský.
A viable company must, on occasion, take even less popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs, it was research and development.
"With subsidies we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence of the international market and gained great appreciation in national fairs," says Zžárský.
Everything indicates that they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žðárský.
An investigation that reveals ridiculous standards
The survey of Absurdez of the year forms part of the fourth business tournament.
Some ridiculous standards have already been removed.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring documents to the administration to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract from the market register, although its officials could obtain it with two motions of the wheel.
Thanks to the investigation, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of social security will no longer request an extract from the trade register when it carries out a control of the insurance taxes," said ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buranóvá.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations which must be respected by companies and businesses in Chequia and to try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms the fourth part of the business tournament of the publication Homóřské novely and begins to create an affair as well between the general public.
While last year's edition contained the participation of three thousand voters, this year was almost four thousand.
And it is not surprising, as we still have several legal obligations over which we must simply be respected for trade.
"Also in the number of papers necessary for the tax declaration we are in first place worldwide," said Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Enterprises in the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement is particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, Chequia is located in position 74a, i.e. eight jobs worse than last year.
The Absurdez competition of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and each year was repeated in the same way.
Anyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.ffararoku.cz. Afterward, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "antipremium" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.ffararoku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that gets more votes.
For this year's survey, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not make sense.
Examples sent them both to businesses and to professional and periodical associations.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of the roads and buses pay the bridge or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which people of the political and social world are often involved.
This year, for example, they attended this act of competition Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continues to work for businesses, so my objective is to eliminate at least thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessary," Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek announced.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not remain in waste water.
In 2007, the most disturbing of people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate with the business office in the permanent operating area for three days with a view to arriving at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was removed in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended in second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the Office of Labour by its foreign workers on work trips for up to 30 days, was removed from the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is going to win.
Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a snow and two ground bascules.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a kidney.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Homoåřské novely competition is the category called the Company responsible for 2010.
This competition is based on support for responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that are involved in the impact of their environmental activities and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, director of the Vodafone's regional mobile operator, organizer and competition sponsor, as in the case of the Year's Rebel competition.
For this new special sub-category of this year's edition of the Vodafone Company's main competition in 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities vary entirely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example persons with disabilities, in other cases of personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of the entire Republic, for example, the company sought software Et Netera, which supported the training of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participated in various sports tournaments.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main fund contributor for the protection of disabled children for seven years.
In Poddebrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its employees, since they constitute more than 70 per cent of the template; therefore, it received the title of the company responsible for the central region of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended third place in the region.
Olomouc won the MiRiz Soft accounting company, which reduced working hours, even under the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it primarily purchased Czech producers, supported Community activities in the area and respected the environment.
"We are trying to redefine as much as possible for our production and administration activities as possible to produce the least environmental impact," explains entrepreneur Milusche Ryzarová.
The responsible TI Enlogit from the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboard; in addition, he supports work from home and in business events he uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Becca Persona in Apuros, which helps in particular the local Roma community," commented the representative of the company Ondréj Suchy.
They are also located in a good place with a mention of the Praní cleaning company in the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive special benefits that affect their pension funds.
"We benefit from food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, from the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of company responsible for the year, it was automatically assigned to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company company of the year who responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
The organizers removed from the evaluation forms that were not complete or incorrect.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the company's competition responsible for the year, but are not qualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual candidates for this competition are not allowed, as this is a sub-categories of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose consultant.
The police carried out arrests during a public service in the building of the Agricultural Fund in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police carried out several arrests in the construction of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
The detectives married a local media and real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public substation for the restoration of rights so that the subsidized land receives an accurate interest.
I should have paid Luboš G. half a million crowns for that.
"For the moment, I can only say that the police are looking for a person by subpoena during a public auction and a public bid," Prévo told the chief of Pilsen Antonie Zelená's chief prosecutor general, adding that at the moment he cannot disclose any details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police left the company for 46 years.
On how I could influence the public summit, given the little official information, it is only possible to speculate.
The spokesman of the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Cerna answered Pravo's questions by saying that the police had actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public hearing.
"It's a client, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public summit is called "Cellatory for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Act" and is carried out when several interested parties are present in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the tenders, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the biggest offer" explained the Fund's portfolio.
Luboš G. had information about who would be presenting the call and, given the fact that he was an interested person because he had acquired several rights of return, proposed to the interested parties in the field that would not participate in the above.
Please, it was covering a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, there was so much money up there.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He was referring to the case of the former chief of PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with disseminating the replacement of lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just received from the Fund some land intended for the construction of public infrastructures, particularly in the area where a large road to the industrial area of Borská is to be built.
Later, he changed them very well with the judge by a house in the city’s own historic center with a very high value.
In this case, the assembly had to intervene because, in the contrary, blocked areas would avoid construction.
Families must pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Houses will have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
As a result, families will have to get out of the map, from January, several hundred crowns per month more than now.
Electricity price increases by 4.6 per cent, gas around 2 per cent, and in some cities, up to 10 per cent will have to be paid by water supply and many will also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should rise to about 100 crowns over the current year.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices due to increased support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaic.
However, gas is moderate, especially at the time when heat is used more and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they should also count with a couple of hundreds of crowns more than a year.
While electricity and gas are all around the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will be paid from January for central heating some 50 crowns per month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague should also support a 9 per cent increase in water prices and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructures.
If the rent doesn't vary, the money will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4 per cent.
There can be considerable increase in rent prices of 450,000 rented rooms in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which owns in Ustí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rent from January to 100%.
The company shall bring the courts to those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regular rentals, which benefit residents of about 300,000 floors, could increase the year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get confused with Fernet and ron. The beer is no longer in a way, because it works slowly
Fernet, Ron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that lead to the end of young alcoholics ’ medical care with less than 15 years of age.
Children who have died in the hospital continually to overcome the cancer are no longer an exception.
This is from the experience of doctors who are in such cases in hospital petition admissions.
"Drink beer the wine is not fashionable anymore, because they're too late to bury them."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic beverages," he told Pravo the pediatric chief of the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Ludék Pelikán.
"When they get to take a bottle to their father from the balcony, it can be whisky, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it is made with juice and that it does not smell so much," he explains.
He also confirmed the Portal of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's often about Fernet or the crown."
"These are modern alcoholic drinks, especially among students."
"In some cases, they use waiting to take them home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, those who often appear in hospitals are under the age of forty.
Before Horóvice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediarium in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in about four times."
"He started at twelve years when he was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor of the department said about this case.
"He was in Holešovice's fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter was missing 48 hours," the boss wondered.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of increasing the consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of itself as dependent.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is well due to a socially or systematically failed family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year at Motol’s paediatric clinic, forty Hebrew children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who experience serious intoxication and must remain in the hospital.
Babies who go home with their parents or with the police are not aware of this.
In addition to the cases where children simply meet after school and are drunk waiting, there are three high stations for Pelikán to mention: the Friday, the Year's End and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink from bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of holidays."
"On the day of the storm I came to see seven Hebrew children at once," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in decontamination under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the chance that they will not suffer a terrible rain at home the next day.
The pain in the morning, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a suction with glucose and by nutrients that are missing in the body.
"These take it much better, because after the bitter night, they wake up well and don't hurt anything."
"Only confusion over where they are is shown," Pelikán points out, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the costs they have incurred.
The transfer to ambulances and hospitalization in a room for patients with severe diseases cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children exactly how much their pregnancy has cost them and that they should spend the whole summer in a job for young people so you can earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
The medical insurance, in its opinion, may be a retrogressive measure, which often returns the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are first found in the hands of aliens in Spain
Two L-159 of a total of five aircraft, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced House C-295M aircraft, left Tuesday for Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the House - EADS aircraft is located.
It's the first time a device like this is in the hands of someone who's not the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only in the foreign country to carry out practice or demonstration flights.
This is the Bible version L-159T1, which has so far been used by the Czech army and is still in power to fly.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 monoplaza.
These are still kept in Air Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, already charged with them last week.
Jan Pejesk, of the Department of Defence Press, indicates that it is still not known when the planes will physically withdraw from Vodochody.
"The L-159 monoplasm aircraft were, in turn, separated from the recently repaired aircraft, without additional investments or contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 bill exchanged in its current state," said Pravo Pejšek.
He added that the army did not stay without Biplaza aircraft, since in May 2009, the army signed a contract with Air Vodochody for a total of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-needed devices for Biplazas.
One of the new aircraft has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejszek, EADS committed to the addition of aircraft to the equipment of some associated countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is the one to withdraw L-159 aircraft and will serve for the pilots of NATO countries."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," Pejszek points out.
The Gomåřské newspaper published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a house aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to purchase and negotiate directly with EADS.
The current defence direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreign country.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft and only used 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of planes House may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should select aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three planes from Casa and the last should arrive at Kbely's airport in fourteen days.
A long index finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with the longest index are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a Wednesday study published in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on testosterone level, male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, in particular for men up to 60 years of age," said Professor Ross Eeles of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be subjected to a test of prostate cancer, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, follow-up was conducted with a British homologo of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than canceling it.
They presented the same risk of prostate cancer as 19 per cent of those whose teeth were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the cancellation finger, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent; for men below 60 per cent, the reduction reached 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two teeth in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the foetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone had an impact on the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knew the study, but that it does not seem that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "expressed completely".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, like most of Europe, had the winter covered with snow.
The roads and steels are covered mainly by compact snow and the remote machines have been circling all night through many areas.
In the morning, the road D5 was closed between 89 and 93 kilometres towards Rozwadov due to several accidents in industrial vehicles and tourism, as well as the D1 in Brno heading to Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK).
A truck occurred in the square mile of 91, and in 93 two industrial vehicles were fired that caused injuries.
A number of tourists have also finished in the kitchen.
There are also problems on the D1 road in the 185 km towards Prague.
There they shot two trucks.
Drivers must slowly travel behind Brno in 190 kilometres or cross Brno and enter 182 kilometres in Kývalce.
A couple of miles have been formed there.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road just along Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimetres and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming attachments for example in Prosek, although they are also congested in Štérboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tranvias circle with delay, for example in the line between Karlov's location and Míru's location.
At eight o'clock in the morning another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airports.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections at three speeds.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
The Ruzyné airport closed from midnight to Friday morning.
Currently, you can already travel by most of the streets of southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska, three secondary roads are closed, Brnänska is forming snow language, and Blanenska needs chains to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Until now the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They'll need fresheners to get rid of them.
At the moment you can't say when you're going to open up the movement.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Carpathy Bilé (White Carpathies).
The roads in the region, which, as it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in the inert state, are collected up to five centimetres of snow, as indicated by ČTK.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimetres of snow, most in north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimetres.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimetres of snow fell.
The snows return gradually to Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army is using a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, now known only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new refle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "stepping the progress of the game" would make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise score.
His bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25-mm calibre munition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives containing it actually works as a small grenade.
Projects can be programmed to operate not only when they hit the target but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind a barrier, a wall or a castle.
No doubt, a normal protection cannot be used and, when its deadly metallic acid flow is released, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for childhood that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to their laser beam, which determines the distance, then get a precise view and, according to the same one, corrects the projection line and opens the button."
"Let's say that it's measured 543 meters."
"When the gun is pushed, the weapon is loaded and launchs the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, at least one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu Consortium transferred its branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Consortium Fujitsu transferred his branch to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the director of the computer-specialized sector and its maintenance of Wednesdays, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of the following year from their former office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyoner Street street in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesman from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, more than 100 other employees of the association, which were previously deployed by the region, will be located there.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the office in Astro Park will favour the way to work with employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only resident in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The bright connection with the airport is very important at the moment for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new shift of an important company in the region brought joy to those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were opposed.
The head of the Frankfurt Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has resulted in a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great impetus to Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The direction first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
Finally, economic reasons led to the fall.
Thus, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and the builder of the building will be cooperative."
The former furniture used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the nearby "Kleine Verticale" were part of the outstanding buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project in the city of the whalery.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the assembly, a new entry is being made to the city, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that previously used the eggs as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and tax companies were installed, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, and then Siemens joined the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was purchased by the real estate group Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consortium, from Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest international supplier of IT.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branches in this area will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
So 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenty-first years, its name is based on its star-shaped plan, which includes central electronic associations and electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
The anxiety is supported more and more by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has removed the display platform from your server.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the white of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently searching for an Internet heritage in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls other countries and companies at Wikileaks' boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people looking for Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wickileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations announced through the Twitter news service Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists have resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon web of services in order to face the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfectly, we're going to target our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using his server via Wikileaks, after a Senator's employee Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain as a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reports British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take these measures before, prior to previous publications of information classified through Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unconsidered and unconsidered process puts our national security in play and threatens life in the world," he said in a communication from the independent senator.
"No company responsible, whether American or foreign, must help Wikileaks with his service to extend stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is found in Sweden for suspected rape, is on the list of people seeking Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has consistently qualified the investigation in Sweden as a mark of his enemy.
Wikileaks' spokesman, Kristinn Hraffsson, said in London that there were threats.
"There's even been calls on Julian Assange's murder."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's security, said Hrafinsson.
Therefore, the location of Wikileaks founder is not revealed.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to the North American declarations.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that Wikileak's disclosures should be judged by treason and executed.
In Canada, a director of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there is a great debate.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of American President Barack Obama, qualified as "stupid and absurd" that Assange has requested the resignation of the State Secretary, if she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats involved in spying.
"I'm not quite sure why we should import the opinion of a guy with a web page," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The US Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Distribution of the National Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed exceptional, announced the White House.
That is why Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the full information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to protect the security of dissidents and activists, Wikileaks should be put at risk.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," said the spokesman of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Healing
"Gelato University" in Bolonia prepares heroes in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future heroes has the greatest influence and visitors all over the world.
In fact, where's all the ice cream coming from?
The gelature and the gelature.
The gelatier produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the production of ice cream.
The gelatio removes the heat from the display with a spatula, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bolonia.
But whoever wants to know more about heroes should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the University of Healing with the Refrigerator in 2003, so that the heating cream of his machinery meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future heroes has the greatest influence and visitors all over the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice and practice in the heating of the home itself.
In these times of crisis, some sleep with a new career, others are at risk of mild colding their wants.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia, passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and wants to offer a European product of quality in the land of industrial heat.
Also, in Berlin, he is a business consultant and wants to create something for himself in a few years within an exciting job.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening a herodom in Cairo.
A man from Malta and others from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian house lover, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The hero teacher Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
It is determined not only by its good taste, but also by its sedative sweetness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the birth cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice is just the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the development seems to be easy.
Luciano makes the basic ingredients: milk, milk, milk in powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large drummer, which warms everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the same time cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine's grip and get out a pasteurized white basic cream, the base for all types of ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural or non-stabilizing elements?
How can you give some tasteless laughs?
Luciano suggests that they withdraw from the trends of the day.
What it speaks of ice "not only of natural ingredients", has best used stabilisers, mainly a natural product, probably rubber guar, of frijol guar.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag, and the customer will smell a hot granite sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
That's a nice job.
With regard to the taste of ice cream, the Lucian teacher distinguishes the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are dust and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to stop flavoured ingredients in their merchandise."
"However, they have to experiment once."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the heat cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powdered cocoa as the basis for all possible chocolate tastes.
Now the participants in the course can use the heaters.
Luciano allows them to produce four different types of vanilla ice, chocolate, moca and apple, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit Healing.
Better know doesn't necessarily depend on having more flavor of tofu or pure fruit.
It is not necessary that the ejaculation of adellas separates dry fruit, if it contains more adhesion.
The working group develops the cooled kiwi worship, which uses more fruit, less water and something less stabilizer.
First a balanced mix highlights the flavor of ice, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is an artimetic problem: The pure melocoton is used with a lot of sugar, it is necessary to reduce the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe.
For lemon oil, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano brings out a tool with which it sets the amount of sugar of fruit types (medication of the viniculator for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easy.
Making iced does not require more than physical application, as before.
It does not just help the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, in which the heat mix is prepared simultaneously and it is exposed to low zero temperature.
Despite all of this, all the automation is left out for the small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo is tired of himself and his companions down with fruit pure, as if it were a giant giant minimist without control.
"In all courses," said the teacher Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that's going on."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has been infiltrated into the transgenic plant industry.
This issue is currently being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institution for independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"There's a conspiracy theory, but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert is also engaged for years in the Ilsi Association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated in the genetically modified Efsa testing standards, which is in a clear conflict of interests, critical of Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time Testbiotech criticises a coalition of interests.
Thus, shortly ago, a high-ranking manager of Ephesus was without support or time for transition to the Swiss Agrarkonsern Syngenta, and has changed with that.
A short time ago, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were conducted by the General Office of the Environment as well as a clear EU parliamentarian.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, as well as some of the industry, should be of high quality and technical quality, are used in a report.
Experts working in Ephesus are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But these contacts must be exposed.
Kuiper supports his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the risk assessment of biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
In this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, does the genetically modified maize in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you gonna find them?" asked the accused, then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
Science has been investigating the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the United States and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by associations.
For companies, critical studies are not published by general rule.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck maintains.
The Track of the Stones
Uli Gsell's got some, total about 400 pounds.
The moon was in front of the Stutgart station, with the Tuba on the back.
Hubo Shows
It's a mess.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to dig a large hole in the north wing.
The country of Stuttgart has never again been the same: Thousands and thousands have shown themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As I was impressed, most of the hall was burned.
Rotary in 6,000, 7,000 pedagogues.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough white stone raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
It is excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he has oiled the smoke of cigarettes.
Still don't know what to do with the boots.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier warehouse of the French Armada, where Manuel Rongen raised his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought everything that came from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be shameful, they would destroy the grave or send it to the bassor," he said in his office, a wooden case that once was a guard case.
They insulted him and threatened him, explaining when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the rest of the northern branch to the waste company.
He talked to the 21S enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that I couldn't do anything about the drain.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took the 80 kilograms cut, with a price of €6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a reminder but also with the hope of being able to bring it back into a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a while.
Owner of gardens, landscape garden, project manager.
They arrived from all sides and took what they could carry on the suitcase and up.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse has been converted into "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He climbs all over his land, making a tour of his great kingdom of 20 acres [20 ha].
He studied law, stopped his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a lover of stones.
It's 4,000 tons of stone.
He's transporting his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the country.
Frena.
In the snow there are artificial sandy stones.
"They took part in the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
She's white, she's yellow, she's warm, she's enthusiasm.
"My dear stone."
The road crosss the woods.
Please note a mount: Red Arenisca, an earlier hole in Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Good transit."
In the past, the magi belonged to the court of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
For every part in the snow, stones and stories, a yellow cross of the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien church, a hole in the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweetness.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a road, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
It has not been made rich, absolutely enormously rich.
But today 14 people said to make the stone processor, as well as candles, a sculptor, a hero, a glassman and a gardener have installed themselves in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the rest.
He's got to go to Colonia in a while.
There are stones there too.
Fighting talents around great potentials
I'm going to give you an active breath in the buffet.
16 students walk around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars have invited a workshop for students of mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the future car with VW workers and learn everything about Volkswagen.
In the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: To hire students with a higher degree in universities, before they enter the labour market and be hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on the skills of their students, it is attempting to target exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second project day at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium won the talent.
A lady of the staff department distributes boliographs, comics and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to talented young people the practical programmes and work for students and shows them their ways in the pool.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University takes the project with VW.
See benefits for both sides: "Students are in contact with industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can meet students, observe more closely the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, says Sele, are not very common.
The novelty is that students want to be so direct.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects," says Selle.
The struggle for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If they don't have to announce and, above all, to get a highly qualified work hand.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German signals), in October, 40,000 vacancies were available.
And, according to VDI's forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even more.
In the audition and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the talent hunt.
It organises expensive contracting events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yuncan, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG branches and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of selection at the exit.
Only the cream of many participants goes to the United States.
The universities are increasingly trying to choose and clean up the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple trajectory for itself only if we were short."
For the catalytics Dykta the notes give results.
"To this day, we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach to the campus, they are also at the house, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their jobs.
"We're trying to get students in specialized parties."
"Something on Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staffed for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company's website there are 35 vacancies.
"It's very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld works with several higher schools, for example the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that they can practice with us or perform their thesis.
There are no advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
Therefore, the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, Latin hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large corporation can't normally offer it," said Stübe, the staff member.
In the search for employment, money is no longer the most important thing.
The determining factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good raise opportunities.
According to a study from the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld hosts the square 55 among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute prepares an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For his question to the employee, I am satisfied that he is working with the same environment and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staffing also expects extra points in its classification by their ambitions to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly placed in the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy that win a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer passes by the employees themselves," he says.
In the era of the sector, it is called Internal Employment Branding, also promoting corporate identity within its own template.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identify it with the company, there is direct promotion for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a pandilla game," says Kriegler.
Obama has new oil perforations
From the coast of the United States of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, there has been no new oil perforation in these years.
The Government of Washington issued a continuum ban and thus cancelled its previous plans in an irrevocable manner.
New perforations seen by the moment also remain in front of the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What led to this strict ban, which will be at least five years old, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the tragedy that cost 11 workers and caused the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under the pressure of opposition and industry.
The participants wanted to reduce the US dependence on new foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it has not been clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black sea in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British Energy Consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
A committee of inquiry commissioned by Obama will submit its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Minister of the Interior, raised the moratorium of perforation after the explosion.
Subsequently, different peterals submitted applications for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to remove a new disaster by using more difficult controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption charges, has fallen into mistrust, has been reformed as root.
Obama announced in a parallel way that the lucrative fiscal gaps for oil and gas consortions will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction of golf will be less due to a stricter regulation, up to date.
"The government plans are the most fragile for the growth of oil and gas industries," says the results of the current survey carried out by BDO consultants - prior to the ban on the extraction of mercury.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are now being extended to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil oil like a gasline: Millions of litres of raw water have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live in slavery, corruption and illegal oil trade.
In Celestine Akpobari it looks good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist assures journalists: "Today there will be enough oil in front of your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been able to photograph boys walking in the water to the close with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the coloured water light, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It's not seen that on the surface, there's a bunch of oil marbles floating around.
Previously on this page, Esther Badom has been wearing shoes on her shoulders, explaining on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the water flows are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the humedal humedal tube by a rotary tube.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most remote regions in the world.
On the way to the river passage through the mandarins, widespread disappointment is evident.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a hot brown, which drops its hand into the water, will take out a lot of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground as dark leaves of gifts, sadly isolated palm trees that shock and shake their palms.
In the van they are looking for birds bands, as if they were in the bathroom as always: As the outer barrier is closed, a fantastic calm kind of a previous paradise with oil and gasoline.
"What's going on here is an ecological struggle," he says, noise, Celestine Akpobari. "We lived in constant danger to health."
The Belgian comparison is in progress.
The ogoni settlement area has been a combined field of battle for over 60 years: the first European explorers have been down here for more than 60 years, the first resistance was organized here in the 1980s with author Ken Saro-Wawa, later executed, here had to put his first factory in 1993 because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
The return of companies to Ogoniland is still prohibited today: While there were daily bombings of more than two million black gold barrels throughout the Delta region, three times as much as Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consolidation.
Each two hundred meters above steel platforms like extraordinary water sculptures: "Boboliths of novadity" called the heads of the perforator.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have a total corrosion.
At every moment a headel fails, Akpobari thinks, then he's carrying a constant oil hole in the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have been converted into 50 years in the Dalta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the average of the "Exxon Valdez" ship 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will face this.
While Shell and oil-based robots are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution, ecologists come to their heads to break up and to the tubes with escapes such as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applied generally low standards of safety to conventions in the world, the scientist Richard Steiner spoke to the concert in 2008: Only the tuberculosis deficits are "over a multiple rather than elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a tank full of oil under the free sky, figures arise from among the Manlars: They are depleted and covered with oil.
One of the many barrels, which are sometimes joined to perforations, sometimes thrown arbitraryly over the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First of all, the gasoline enters through the tube in the container, later the petroleum tube drops and finally goes out of diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel daily: "We bring 34,000 naira," about $22.
The residents of the Delta take advantage of the lack of fuel in one of Africa's largest oil cities.
Nigeria only has one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just EUR 40 centimetre per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: thus reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network that passes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a significant part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegal: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military responsibilities, preserve the best part in aljibes and sell it cheaply in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether environmental disasters should be better handled by the population or by the flow of production.
"If oilmen did not behave as invasives and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."

Researchers detect hazardous manufacturing defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced landing, researchers found a potential factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
Kantas Airport wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Kantas Airbus, which carried out an emergency landing in early November, had much more luck than they could imagine: Australian air security authorities have seen through their investigations a major safety problem in some A380 engines, and they have warned of a potential factory failure.
The potential defect has complicated impacts: In a manguites connection, fissures can be caused by fatigue or screams, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the engines produced by Rolls-Royce with 20 A380 aircraft.
Among those found in the Kantas-Airbus, there was a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
Australian aviation begins legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a complaint at Sidney's federal court that allowed more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Kantas, stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident of early November.
In the brand of the engine they have lost pieces and their needle is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gas as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be repatriated.
Australian researchers announced that more security tests will be carried out on the superjumbos with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, an ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become sufficiently important as to inform all affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the plane kept its fleet A380 in the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa rest the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the world's largest passenger plane.
A Nevada across the country provokes traffic chaos
Germany is completely white: From day to day it has snowed almost the whole country.
In many streets the chaos is falling, the trains and the planes fall.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
In winter Germany: Nearly all the country reached warm temperatures during the night of Thursday, which has caused the chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited in most bus stops and in many streets.
At the A7 in Flensburg, quitters are constantly operating, removing the new snow once and for all, but they are not ready.
In addition, strong wind currents cut off the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) is waiting for seabeds with a water level of 1.2 metres above its usual level at the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In São Paulo, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on national roads and roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partly 30 centimetres of recent snow falling and cold winds and strong winds are responsible for the removal of it.
There were many trucks and cars caught during the night.
The police authorities also reported important incidents in the streets in Sajonia Anhalt.
In the A2, the snow and wind halted traffic and created obstacles.
In Turingia the nevads affected both A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the roads or the destroyed chain and the caves are the main problems.
The interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in São Paulo.
In Saafeld, Turingia had an ICE train to stop her trip to Munich.
The bombers and the rescue service provided 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink.
Winds with snow are breaking the streets.
In Germany’s largest airport, snow winds caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman from the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The liquids are constantly operating.
However, there are few passengers on the airport, despite that there are 400 camping beds prepared for them.
In many streets, Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker fell into a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The mechanic suffered mild wounds.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was abandoned.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's journey to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
He also lost a 30-year-old woman, after giving her car back to Aschaffenburg on a battle route.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be more softer and softer and therefore it will be repaired in soft pieces.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will no doubt continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Diesche Bank seeks a buyer for his jemela towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutschen Bank settled its headquarters: The Gemal Towers were modernized in Frankfurt's banks; while the banks returned to their former workplace.
But now the financial association seems to want to profit from the cost of the renovation, and find a buyer for the two rascals, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims, based on a portfolio.
The carrier does not specify the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether property should be owned or sold and then rent it again," he said.
Therefore, Germany’s largest credit institution re-examines its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the thresholds in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investor of a home fund and then implemented the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a figure of about 200 million euros.
A sale would supply a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in this area estimate the value of the newspaper's towers named Greentowers in about EUR 500 million.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, the carrier confirmed.
Thousands of people fighting for missing mines
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about buried mines, which were given because of failures after many explosions in a mine.
However, the corpses have not been found, as security measures remain precarious in the place of disaster.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between 17 and 62 years of age were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of the disaster, but no sign of survival was found.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no security equipment was able to fall for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts felt that there was no possibility that miners had survived.
The bodies could not be recovered until the date.
At present, relatives and friends remind the deceased of a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent sunlight in Greymouth on the south-east island.
Keep silence for two minutes.
In honour of buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also personal photographs and objects, under the clothes and surfboards.
The flags went on half to the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the Dutch government, to the participants in the memorial act.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the memorial act.
At the first explosion on 19 November, mines of British and South Africa were also buried.
Rescue workers began to fire inside the coal mine on the island of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures in the mine will begin to decline, Gary Knowles, the chief of police, told journalists.
To the devil, warrior!
Is the gorilla stuck in the art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refung reexamines the gender boundaries with his "Wallallalla Rising" battles.
In what public will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about the "Wallalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior captured with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees his torturers and kills his enemies with almost overhuman struggles, a sound ideal for young spectators who seek bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and start his enemies the tribes of his body with life when he is in bad mood.
On the other hand, Unito, as it is called in fact, does not say almost any word during the entire film and the other characters are left to carry for how much one or two phrases or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they are surrounded and enjoyed the beautiful and terrible mountain landscapes of Scotland, which vessels offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
More ideal for grown and interested cinematists in existenceism and very quiet camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients, it is a shame that they can't be discarded by mutual means.
Director Winding Refün considers his lifesaver and his trilogy on the drug dealer prison "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he strongly refuses to make his works for all the public with something more humor in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic home.
A brain mass and a bunch of trophies can't convince most of the followers of the artistic film.
Most of the fans of the action die of frustration, if Uniojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries for interpretative reasons and is trapped forever in peace and snow before his team arrives in America and gets back there.
It's a joke that "Wallalla Rising" has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It's a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because, after the budgeting and bleeding façade, a piece of movie is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, it's all atmospheric, a February dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is only a moment of relaxation and its glare images and the loud sound band make him a nude in his throat, above all, the incredible hate that comes from the hearts of the characters to him.
Only a small young ruby, who loyally supports the Union, preserves something as innocent, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time an out-of-fire warrior for temporary enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
He represents the loss, but perhaps only those who are lost in all ways.
"Wallallalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, to get angry, change and surprise.
An experience.
Dark's move
The OIEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to think on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 attacked a mysterious Cuban building in Syria.
It is located on the edge of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometres from Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that flows out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the nearby El-Kibar is very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technique serves only for other purposes than for those of the fifty years.
The CIA showed a video presentation with dirty satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
It was not long ago that the reactor was operating, he says, but he was still not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is only more known than since then, the enigma have become bigger with time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in El Kibar, but that he only saw indications that there would be a "nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
In Europe, several Secret Service agents prefer to be even smarter and only talk about a "suppressive reactor", although they consider the CIA presentation "pleasible".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the OIEA.
When he was asked what security he had in front of a reactor, a senior UN diplomat replied in a paper-based way that the IAEA had "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians broke down very quickly from the shoulders of the alleged "unusable military building" and drove the land to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an OIEA team under the command of the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium cracks in El-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the OIEA received satellite images of a Member State, of commercial sellers right after the attack, who must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the OIEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always understood that he had never had a secret nuclear programme nor built any reactor.
The Uranus was a source of Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The OIEA rejected it as inverse after analysis of particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter, as well as the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from having a second inspection in the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also kept a tight grip on it.
"We will never comment on it," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "has progressively become a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a high-level Western diplomat in Vienna corresponds to a place in the OIEA, which is ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, by which the OIEA sees it.
The OIEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "functional" with the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
Inspectors have not been able to know publicly until the time when the equipment is being handled, the functions they have, or if they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has designated as internal Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah, again derived from the proximity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits access to the three locations at the OIEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians are afraid of a record that the United States has requested the OIEA to spy out military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment due to the United States' secret service warnings.
Through satellite photos, the OIEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube along the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high position in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams could be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities", nor of the enriching of uranium or recycling; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should be subsequently separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best case, possible assumptions.
There is no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are found in the three places.
As hundreds of trucks on the ground disappeared, no one has information about where the mines remain.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from El-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, was recognized by the Syrians in 1998 as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But photos from the orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements in the three suspected locations and eliminated large containers after the OIEA requested entry.
It can be random, but it only contributes to resolving the suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has been working for a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which would allow Syria to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were comforted by the fact that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, since a few months ago, Glyn Davies, a U.S. ambassador of the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most serious means the nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, director of the OIEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but still empty.
This path is very risky: most of the OIEA governance council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not particularly anxious for a scale.
On the other hand, how did a diplomat reflect: "And what happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love in War Times
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her start yet without name.
She herself wrote the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
It is not known much more about the subject, but this is sufficient for aggression.
Rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, loves her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have protested rapidly, with which some days of travel planned in Sarajevo have been transferred to Hungary lately.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested an interview with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the Ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It's not diplomatic, women offered him a meeting in Hungary last week that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position in the matter of deliberating the victims is enough on the guide.
His organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be given asylum as Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who read the guide, gave after a shot and requested permission to write in Sarajevo, is not quite clear why Jolie wasn't in spite of everything.
The young author repeats that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, puts forth great effort in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and vote to all the parties involved.
Its contents remain unclear.
In the network, there is a second synopsis of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and are reunited when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian field where he works as a guard.
What sounds quite different is the variant "violence victim loves torture".
I'm sure Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unjust and based on wrong information".
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the lead remains in the network illegally, as many others have previously.
Nothing like far away from here
This afternoon finally becomes good for the Irish.
No trace of distress
Instead, the household team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cry out with joy as the music goes back, they beat the ground with their feet.
The Baley Club lives in Cork, because the players are launching, and they find, pingpong balls on the beer vessels from a distance of three meters.
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros more than one flight tickets to Las Vegas for the world champion of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type, this extraordinary drink game and computer intelligence actually don't make good mixes.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, to distract himself from the sobering question, what will happen to him in the future?
The fun in Las Vegas is not in its plans, will be held in January in a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presentation," he says.
"It's very far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His bride waits for him in Auckland, "from a shot he got the work of his dreams as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and the sound.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three brothers have already sought happiness abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, her Colin brother is currently working as a IT consultant in London.
Young people go: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predicting economic experts and the Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 immigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The prognostics are confirmed, there is a migration wave comparable to the island's suffering in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great prosperity to the Irish, the melancholy is currently expanding.
The economic crisis is all too confusing for well-formed young Irish people, for whom it has so far been up.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of thirty are in the pair.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director of a mass of young migrants, who complain, "In Ireland everything is broken."
"There should be a rise against politicians and banks, but whoever can, goes and lose our country and with it to a whole generation."
"The last one closes the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish student union, will appear a future nightmare because the government is only devoted to mountains and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to reach new jobs," says 20-year-old girl.
Note how their companions engage in unremitting practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is to have to immigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressive."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair offering a service around the subject of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is a great opportunity, the first steps to lead your career," the manager says.
On its website are photos of a boy practicing surf in Australia and of others practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, if it does not bring freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows how to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish partners in construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works extra hours to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, since it was a long time ago when he broke the threshold of his home.
"Gano money in Germany for a home in Ireland, where I've never been so good."
He smells something shameless and goes for heated rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardening care in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked in the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for EUR 380.000, 100 per cent funded by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with credit?
O'Donovan thinks of a mouse, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to eat and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer does not like complaints that he often hears at present.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with many differences, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and counts on his father, who was in England during the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes ideas.
To leave the future and just see what life is on the other side.
He's been working for a few years in London and why didn't he go well with him and his bride in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that worries you about the over-manoeuvre: the celebration of your 27 birthdays in Dublin.
I'm afraid you can get a chance at a holiday party.
"Only, not too much emotions," he says and gives a big lead to his brain.
"Dissed, very anxious sound."
"We call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private enterprises, continues to increase.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in most of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for follow-up of the change of attitude in the region.
The results of this year's survey, carried out in September and in early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the coast of the South American Peace (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from a 40 per cent reduction in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of Mexico and Brazil's respondents, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced democracies, which lowers the regional media (see Graph 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy operates in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as in both cases, but significantly higher than in 2003 (17 and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America seriously affected the support of democracy.
The fact that it has remained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries have only been affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and that this year has been reduced to 32 per cent.)
However, the state of mind would vary considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and has increased violent crimes.
For the second time since the beginning of the investigations, the most investigated in Latin America mentioned crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing your country (see Graph 5).
About 31% claim that either they or a close relative has been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38% of last year and is the lowest percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while only 56% were in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of Venezuela's respondents agree (and 80% support private enterprises), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is excommunicating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a greater leadership in the region, as indicated by 19 per cent of respondents (18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent versus 11 per cent last year).
However, the United States is the most influential country in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela retains this title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
No one expected that the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, they have gone far worse than foreigners who are trying to help the country cope with their problems.
Votes were introduced in the Urs, some people voted several times, papers taken in the canals, destroyed electoral colleges and intimidation acts.
The electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
A number of Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake in January, wandered across the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them finally gave themselves up for victory.
A dozen candidates to the presidentials, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and asked for the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, United Nations senior officer in Haiti, stated that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, with caution, that "we do not think that these irregularities, in serious terms, are necessarily invalidating the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents, is committed to René Preval, the populative President, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
It is expected that the disintegration will take place in January.
All expectations for elections have not yet been lost.
The two main candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old lady, have withdrawn their initial request for invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Celestin, who only has support, if he has any, has gone through the second round.
Given that the epidemic of cholera strikes the country and more than a million earthquakes survivors continue to live in stores, a great halt is expected.
When the moment arrived, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot in the game.
Assistant donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, according to the patent, the Haitians also think of it.
Stepping points towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity rate at 20 points, up to 50%, the highest level that has been registered since her election in 2007.
In spite of everything, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections of the coming year will depend on whether clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nastor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not final.
Mr. Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that were infraval with tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income on its discretion.
In theory, Ms. Fernández's government lost most of it in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's disappearance due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some prominent members of the peronist movement in power have faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after a caustic session in which a member handed a sentence to each other on the face and other Members accused the sovereignty government, the Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be implemented next year, which will provide the President with an even greater margin of action at the time of spending it.
The economy is improving significantly: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the union wage requirements, are approximately 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was at the edge of the economic collapse, made the growth and reduction of poverty a priority rather than the control of inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made the INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt to official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials claim that they want to limit wage increases by close to 18 per cent in the year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum of growth achieved with a high assessment in 2002.
Perhaps for that reason Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached an agreement with the beneficiaries who had refused a forced restructuring prior to the debt that Argentina had not subscribed in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the credible Governments grouped in the Paris Club, which is worth about $6,700 million.
Kirchner always insisted that this would not involve the supervision of the IMF as usual.
However, last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to prelude to the purity of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to pursue politics when he has completed his mandate, bearing in mind that he no longer has his husband on his side.
If you do so, you will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has been discouraged by Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinans return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If she wants to win other elections, she will have to decide whether she will remain silent or not. Many of her husband's policies.
Average threshold for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about her big brother on the other side of the road?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the voters, joined the mayors and councillors of five urban districts on 27 November in what appears to be the President's extensive evaluation, Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. Ma himself has become a champion of feelings across the continent, creating innovative business links, including a free partial trade agreement, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party had finished winning three of the five elections to the mayor, it was not possible to obtain most of the votes.
In its place, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been moved by a total independence of Taiwan, has practically obtained 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they had been presidents, Mr Ma would have been in trouble.
Since your election two years ago, the proportion of votes in your party has decreased by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD was affected by KMT in the mergers.
In the elections, typical elements of the Taiwanese elections were seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with bandits and light girls dancing.
Nor did the mysterious attempt to kill hard.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary president of KMT, was campaigning by one of KMT's candidates the night before the elections.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly at his face, beating him and killing a transcontinent.
The curious thing is that it was not possible to determine whether the man claimed to harm Lien or to win the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, raising doubts about the PPD and causing voters to be moved by the KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising not to deal with the matter of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its independence in fact and hates the military threat of China.
Therefore, KMT often avoids advertising its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging feelings against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
On his behalf, Mr Ma stated that his policy with regard to China had been confirmed that his policy was acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to subsidize them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve Taiwan's return to exile.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Of course, he would like to get political integration as well, but the first is the first.
It will be best to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to take place.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was convicted of corruption.
The President, between 2000 and 2008, openly urged explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is trying to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been warmly welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, like His Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled his mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that he can also have relations with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the creation of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could be undertaken without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustable alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitated approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better stopped if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic officer, not to present to the presidents.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from among its potential candidates.
KMT must also carry out a consciousness examination.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears primarily due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman claims that he will restructure his office, as well as local teams.
The main examples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese think economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known colonist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Names to Grammy: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of revealing artist.
Act on a president's request, and possibly people will stick to you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz poet and singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level appointment in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Taking into account that Spalding has been a well-known form of jazz since its 2008 album, "Hope", the designation to which you think, but it respects the rules of Grammys according to which it must be an artist who has not taken more than three albums into the market before writing what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was no doubt a big step forward and, taking into account his clear and pleasant voice style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, fun and Latin rhythms, can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the path towards the success of Nora Jones, the closest equivalent to the Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated in the jazz field for this category.
In the remaining categories, the Grammy voters gave due honor to "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent disc that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the competitors of Iyer is the Veteran saxafonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the teclist John Beasley by "Positoothly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite stripper in New Orleans and usually invited to "Treme", from the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest is significantly focused on mergers such as Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's Salvage Punk gained a worthy recognition in the category of large groups, working against the great jazz camera of Billy Children Assembly and the always-arrived Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Paths", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the Dutch man in his band.
Appointments to Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The designations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of the Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main appointments were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", by plane and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for the eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among those named with links to southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his synphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and extraterrestrial at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also named by his Mandolin Concerto.
The names of classical music are distributed in nine categories covering orchestra albums, opera, coral and solo.
The year's classic producer category includes five named Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Malinson.
The names for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Synphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertebouw Orchest; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Synphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Saccharium - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the Opera category, the names are Berg by "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "The Love of Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Marinesky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers named a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt by Synphony No 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Appassionate Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Grafiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
The Symphony No. 4 of Pärt was released at the Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, headed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, for about 30 minutes, is added to "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the old oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is named by the instrumental soloist act with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the piece of 15 minutes specifically to touch it in the Avi Avi Avital dolina, which interpreted the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with voices from the Middle East and many steps and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, was appointed in the Orchestra function category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the so-called instrumental soloists are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and archipelago Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The names as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic blend category, soprano Jesse Norman was named after his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mix in Temcula receives the approval of the Management Committee
The Temecula mix project has received the unanimous support of the local management committee after more than five hours of public witness, often calorated.
Critics attacked the project saying that it promoted terrorism and the attacks.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or pagans, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temcula valley, Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Just talk very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who were in favour or against the centre, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"United States no longer exists", read in one of the comments.
"It's another Seed Planet with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The construction plans of Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, in New York, where attacks took place on 11 September 2011.
In the Valley of Temecula, the Imam Mahmoud Harmous has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has lived together for years without problems in the Riverside county, but it wanted a greater and better space than the warehouse that was purchased in a shared property with a water filter system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mix, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two mines and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4,32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opposers can still resume the project before the municipal council.
An arsenic-resistant microbiology raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that there are possible life forms without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"You can grow either with phosphorous or with arsenic."
"That turns it into something very peculiar, although it doesn't need to be a kind of life-form really 'aliengena'," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the Thursdays of Science publication.
Since then, there have been six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing the phosphorus by the arsenic.
"It makes you plant as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for finding life in different planets of the Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it has.
The study focuses on a microbio discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press round to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a great speculation on the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
I didn't.
What the discovery "so shows is that in other planetary environments, there may be organisms that use other elements to stimulate their biochemicals and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider necessary for life may not be so tight," said Charles Cockell, a cathedral of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the substitution of one element separately in biochemical and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Symon of the NASA Institute of Astrobiology, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it presents high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from the chemical point of view, so it was estimated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
"Arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behavior is similar to the phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for different organisms to distinguish."
"However, the arsenic is quite different than that so it doesn't work as well as the phosphorus, so it comes in and, in some way, calls biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
The microbio grows better with phosphorous, but the fact that it can live with arsenic in its place raises the possibility that there may naturally be a form of life that uses arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant microbiology professor at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that an arsenic can be replaced by the phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example that proves it works.
Arsenic was the most common in the early days of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"I know that it suggests that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed in the Earth in the past," Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Symon's research team.
The investigation included the support of NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found
The two dogs that were missing from the four thieves in front of the Bellflower motel were found, according to the officers of the sheriff of the Los Angeles county on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Gales Corgi, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, against Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs recovered the Wednesday afternoon, and the other two found the Wednesday, late at night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman from the sheriff's department in Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs will be fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They returned with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to specify exactly where the dogs were found, in any neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"It's carrying out an investigation."
"We don't mean anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found, so they made some comments on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek claimed to show in the competitions in the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukanuba national champion in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to show up to Trace.
The other dogs were to show them in other competitions scheduled for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, according to Peek a to The Times the Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops in the two-month cycle that the couple participate in cane competitions.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in on the motel.
They usually stay in motorcycles and park the vehicle just in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer creature, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very rough coat and would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van theft on Tuesday morning at six o'clock in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
The Thursday was not clear whether it would be a reward or not.
The lion is ready to run again, when the MGM restructuring receives the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York federal banker officially approved the "prepared" plan by creditors to remove about $5 billion in debt, opening the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and external production of films and television programs.
The failure of the Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. banking code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relax under the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrated.
In fact, MGM will not be released from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently signing the credit, which is contributing to $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. Investment Bank was hired to advise on the management necessary to manage its finances, while it was struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-President of Enron and expert in the recovery of iron companies, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and meet more than 140 students in the study required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company at sale by the end of 2009.
However, the above attracted a few posters and no one was willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disputes, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits from the bank in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion-dollar subsidies for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who have been collecting $375.000 per month for their company's management services, will receive a four-million-dollar "winners of success".
Barber and Birnbaum planned to resume production in MGM, which spent only one film this year, and met an annual pizza of seven or eight films that will be released in 2012.
They also planned to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study requires a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investigator Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of MGM debt, has been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep your budget balance for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful player this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant fine in their budget for gifts.
Consider that the price of an iPad can buy five BMX bicycles of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or about 48 sides of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently visited three national toys sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic games could buy at least $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Law was working; the technological game of this year will probably have more power, with the same weight and even a little less compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally less new games with associated websites, two of the most known types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And players driven by button arrows are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery players.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are playwrights of the size of a doll that sing a note when their barrels are opened.
A beat is equal to a note, and a second beat begins to shoot a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start to bite, you can't stop.
For as long as it is combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-pound animated mussel plays tournament change games like Simóm Dice, and can take the moon step, thanks to its innovative legs with wheels with locking device.
Children who tried the game used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though their parents complained about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the '80s, you can remember Alphae, one of the first computered educational games.
He has returned (hasbro/Playscool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a full set of question-cards designed to turn a car passage into a session with an ongoing self-correction exercise schedule.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smart phone, here will be three independent options.
MobiGo de VTech ($60, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), it is the first place on the Leapster line, with a new and brightest screen.
No version is compatible with old cards.
IXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes-type system to present electronic games and books, and has a range of SD cards that allows to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks only larger than a box of cells, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to weapons words by placing the blocks in line before the time is over; it is fearful for an improvised weapon competition.
They're increasingly players that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in playgrounds, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a online mask at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, from 6 to 12 years) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credit in the Club Penguin store for two articles.
These could include panties on wheels or a puffle mascot game.
Lightly larger than the backbone of its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microbots driven by button arrows.
The false insect is moving rapidly over 12 silica pads that live in random directions.
It's fun to make a block lab to see if you can find the exit.
It's a long time, too.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even pass a mouse inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of order maintenance in China is promoted
As a urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin took the step in a square of the city, seriously inspecting the nervous people at his post, issuing low-vote orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the city police officers of China's urban order, scared and disappointed by their powerful actions and their incitement to violence, to convey a certain impression to a bunch of spectators.
"Fires!"
"Pay attention!"
Show them, he smiled, "How beautiful the girls are!"
Four girls who just passed adolescence with white gloves and identical green olive jackets and adjustable pants to call attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly on the top of the hair hit with blue and white hair.
"I personally think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, unjustly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree title.
The province of Guangdong changed the gray green color of the uniforms to a seemingly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of the force by alarming glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials surrounded a truck of snacks, and observed it with the constant cold for half an hour until the ambulance salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, explicitly elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give you the police shower a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's child's respect for these city soldiers.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed only to comply with city orders, imposing many and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed a transcontinent after using their cell phone to film them while resolving a protest against a green waste.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin inspectors was hacked and published on the Internet, in which it was described as an effective attempt on innocent offenders.
This year, a salesman of Shanghai Sands suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a cicator in the government," China Daily, a national publication, complained last year after another tactical dispute.
The newspaper demanded "a really methiculous cleaning."
The sceptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the district asked for eight new female recruits in October for notice, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real rights or were simply a stage entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both things.
The district notice requested female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious faces".
They should have a height above the average, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at 26 years of age is compulsory.
Officials said that the work was physically excessive for women over 25 years of age.
"Your image is the important thing," said an anonymous district official to Rednet.com, a government cassi website.
"First, the external qualities of candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperature "and the inner qualities".
Chenggaan women are like flowers, he said, and he added, "In addition to being flowers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the city administration office of the district, is not concerned about supporting this description.
But he observed that high requirements were standard in many Chinese labour notices for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of harmonious facial features.
If this means being careful, it is a matter of debate among Chinese people.
Of course, the less qualified or defies must not be presented.
"We can't let a cook or a thief come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its colorful mejillas and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her face is sexy, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old working companion, Xu Yang, said, "Our work must present the city's image."
They also do not oppose their work at a certain time, they say, because they have higher career ambitions than just helping sellers in the streets where they are supposed to carry on their business.
Each morning, the team faces more or less than a dozen ambulance sellers that launch on foot or on bicycle, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu bags as possible before being excavated.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" said Ms. Xu while a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily leaving his car driven by bicycle with fiddles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than abusers.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studied marketing in his free hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officials lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' market.
They can only threaten by accusing the offenders of their supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the recent public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were raised after spreading the false rumors that some Canadian officials had murdered a seller.
More than a dozen police officers or Chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were stolen or burned.
For the moment, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But peace is only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the charming Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the air instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed awfully.
The situation continued for 15 minutes before officials, with a bad face, were allowed to take steps to their cars and to be quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator assigned to the male team, remained behind, with his white signal returned to hide his name.
Like female officials, coordinators, men aged 40 or over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time is the public that starts fighting."
Taxes will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice had charged Senator John Ensign with the criminal charges that arose from his business with an ex-combatant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the most legal threat faced by Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered possible presidential candidate of the Republic for 2012, until the scandal over his case had national holders last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it felt "surely happy" by the decision, which came after an investigation of an entire year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no intention of raising charges against him on this subject".
The Department of Justice did not wish to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have been confabulated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobby.
The interviews, the e-mail and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and appealed on behalf of them after they hired Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law to make lobby for his ex-employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict the use of former state employees using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared as a first case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the status of revolutioning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reason behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared cautious at the time of accepting political proceedings after several important reviews for its public integrity section, including the decision of last year to abandon the proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the form of charges for misconduct.
The federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and another phoned the following day, saying that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a Wednesday statement, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which claimed that a payment of $96,000 of Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was no more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that has been supporting the senator for a long time, which has obtained work through lobby thanks to the help Ensign gave him in Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Ensign's office, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that the Ministry of the Interior was "mocking" about a dispute.
Ensign also attended a dinner with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to make lobby.
When the news of the case first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told journalists that he planned to post a third term in the Senate two weeks ago.
When Ensign's voice, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"Senior Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chating" in the court room's rows.
Minutes later, reports of the amazing witness were sent on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says, there were more than 14,000 Twitter messages on the process that dealt with the rape and the children trapped in their beds in a house that was burned.
The Thursday, the widely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the death penalty imposed by the jury.
However, Mr. Hayes' lawyers have submitted written statements in court describing the arguments of the appeals that will probably deal with the courts for years.
One of the most protracted claims that intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a circular atmosphere", and this generalized and immediate saturation with outstanding details made public passions exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint may force the appellant judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the court room is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the chief defence attorney of Mr. Hayes.
The first court judge, Jon C. Blue, of the State Supreme Court, rejected the claims in a case last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by passion.
But it will probably not be the last word on the subject.
Over the decades, appeals courts have recognized that the coverage of cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic case in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the sentence of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in her decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had a "carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
Crime is believed to have been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fleet".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that had examined Mr. Hayes' sentence half a century later might be interested in the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the Court's chambers, something inimical in the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said to be arbitraryly imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might feel disturbed by the idea that limiting immediate communication from court rooms could make judges more fair.
The issue of Twitter is only one of many issues outlined by Hayes lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes might have been injured when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the responses of potential jury members, showing them spectacular photographs of the crime scene during the jury's selection.
Some jurors have said they were terrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela of 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly removed a jury who had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had wrongly pressed for a verdict by his foreign decision to order the jury to discuss it for a week.
The jury wasn't kidnapped.
But its arguments about the impact of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a refusal to the Verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for Governor and United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly pushed away the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something I've never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the whole state."
His attention to the cover of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports submitted earlier was a playful vision that would make the court's policy on the control of coverage weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments for adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that complaint.
In his letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which repeals the sentence of Dr. Sheppard due to the cover of the trial, and made it clear that they would require new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "is the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the twenty-first century."
Can the civilization tend a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign by the investment and the negatives, this week a few civilisations have been launched in Washington.
Is it a preoccupation with a genuine future bipartidist cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the party fight in the capital?
The March meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not lead to any progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But what they all say, there was at least a short discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, instead of being another empty episode to win party points.
The president's deficit committee's public meeting was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that still separates members.
That is just enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a test period, seeking mutual recognition of signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and subsequent evaluations by participants were made with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very profound as to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
As far as taxes, costs, health assistance or social assistance are concerned, both parties are at the point of opposition.
In any case, the November election has softened the humor in Washington, at least for a short time.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to how to say things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections open side passions, which then disappear.
That's good."
In some cases, in particular those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment subsidies for unemployed workers.
Following the March meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartidism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
On the contrary, he stated that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
"After things have to be done, psychology will soon reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilization can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the major event in 2012," he said.
The reasons are very much to see with the creation of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who have made a decisive contribution to their creation.
More aware that the Republican leaders are at risk of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut the costs of the state and repeal the new health law.
These partnership lines are already clearly noted in initial responses to the recommendations of the Committee on Debt, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and retirement age, and the cost cut.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been charged with one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have introduced the issue of deficit in the order of the public day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to reach that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the staff selected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few grounds or wish for commitment in tax matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggles between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
The first will take place next year in the form of party shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama about the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partnership of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead spot, as happened in 1995, then both parties will observe carefully the reaction of people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and find a compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partidism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of the Congress than was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization that is shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points in the issues that still divide them.
A United States filter document portrays Moscow as a paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy" and leaves part of the shields and protection money received directly to Kremlin, according to the United States Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service manage huge singing systems, which helped to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They earn money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal groups.
Each aspect of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its part as the money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on his Wednesday website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and he was guilty of much corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev asked him in October, but there has been little evidence of purity since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically rejected the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several free claims on such charges.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked him about a document that would suggest it was corrupt, he said, "It's a joke, a joke, a joke."
According to the polls, the Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is not unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the Ambassador's report, and it is unheard of that they are diplomats from a foreign country who do so.
"The direct slabes of the government of the city of Moscow with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note states.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means 'tech' or protection) that passes the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the tax office, as well as all sectors of the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"SFS, MVD and the militia are at the second level."
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that SFS earns the money of the largest companies, and that the police refers to small businesses.
One source stated that the report "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understood that it was best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) because they had not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal pandemics is no longer a priority."
The note notes that, while money laundering is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are under arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed by a text or other.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassies report on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash in effect, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must trust the bureaucrats," said Georgiy Satarov, director of the group of Indian experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he stated that corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, India estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in item 154 (the countries are classified at least as the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the United States Ambassador's note, which did not occur until late in the night of Moscow, will certainly cause disappointment within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be false and reacted furiously by a revelation that claimed that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The Veterans of the Red Jemeries are forced to face the past
In a weakly lit hall, with broken and unscathed walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School reminded the man that he had built it, the last leader of the Red James Ta Mok.
"Here's everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemeries, the commander continues to be popular in this remote ex-Fortage of the Red Gemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrender to the government, the long-standing loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to meet publicly with those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a book of secondary school texts that first taught him the history of the Red James to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a UN-Camboya Joint Court issued the first sentence of an ex-member of the Red Jemeres, condemning the former chief of the known torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, for 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, the anxiety has increased among the veterans of the Along Veterans of Anlong Veng, putting their efforts into reconciliation and their efforts to reintegrate the Cambodian society.
"There is sympathy and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Roses was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is creating divisions within families."
During the government of the Red Jemeries of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, hunger, disease, or overwork were executed or killed, about 1.7 million people.
When the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Paul Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an surprise that lasted until the last movement that took place in December 1998.
As Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the war of wars from their bases on the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters from the Red James began to retreat to the government, culminating in the achievements of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Kheu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was arrested by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of its beneficiaries, the oldest combatants of the Red Jemeries fell into absolute poverty common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for movement.
Although a few elite members of the Red Jemeries maintained their local administrative positions instead of depositing their weapons, racial soldiers continue to be poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have received a few benefits after the return," Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation said, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of doing business."
On Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when he was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeries was good," he said.
"Tak Mok told him to eat everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to defend ourselves."
The current Jameres Rojos court has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, it is expected that the court will begin to process Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Red James.
The court's mandate is to process major leaders and those with greater responsibility for crimes, but it has not stated whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This is not used much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation was concentrated at Im Chaem, 64, who was a district head in Banteay Meanchey province during the government of the Red James in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma arrest, a project in which thousands of forced workers were thought to have died.
During a recent bitter afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields at his home on wooden pilots on a dirt road in the hills of Anlong Veng.
When the sun set long shadows on the resurgence meal, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeries.
She said that if the court didn't call her, she wouldn't be present.
"Camboya is in peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more processes, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who visited the Red Jemeries in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the text book of secondary school history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red James.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's connection with the regime.
Toque Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new text book helped students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents reacted with scepticism when she took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book of text and the court," he said.
"They have doubts because they are not sure of the number of persons to be prosecuted by the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are starting to produce an impact, he said.
In any case, here the Red Jemeries preserve a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many bad grasses and depleted plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black hole covered by an oxidated roof of hojalat.
Paul Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of neumatics after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a mobile salesman on the street said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many local residents go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the performances of Nuom Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Paul Pot's last rest, where he would leave a hand of mature plates with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus accepts to give up its arms-qualified uranium reserve
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Government of Belarus announced the Wednesdays that will abandon its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to convince Belarus that it had abandoned its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning the spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for the armament of a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymous due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47 nations in the Nuclear Security Summit, chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
It was thus a good success to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I really felt fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to break free from all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept the highly enriched uranium (cent of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for armament) and the low-rich uranium," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our stuff first... we're not going to make garbage bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended Monday and was made on board.
The U.S. Government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with the installation of research with low-rich uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Energy Department official working in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with great care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But the Wednesday's declaration suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "as long as progress is being made on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is still a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo in Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is how Wikileak's (capable) documents are reflected in the newspaper El Country, where it is added that the first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández of Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed "to demonstrate that they exercised proper surveillance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, of which a meeting was held between former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Government of Zapatero out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From Vega he stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "prevented pills," Aguirre reports on a cable.
The then titler of Foreigners, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would give this issue the lowest possible profile, although the Government had limited influence when in the hands of judges".
For its part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Ambassador that he would not attempt to block the court's initiative to request the disclassification of the National Intelligence Centre (NCI) documents and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal element or any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States reflected its concern about the "explain coordination between the Spanish judge and the German tax", more than the disclassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will make our efforts to manage the case clearly between Governments," Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, in a lunch between US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are very zealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his colleagues "to avoid retroactive inflation comments, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the implementation of the PP in this regard.
"In spite of its general American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures have negative consequences for the US Government," she said.
The same confession was resting on the "hobo" network of being a mother.
The young man was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror of the galley"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this name, which has been used since childhood, he communicated with a primal and, at least, a friend; the two natures of Noah, the Korean people who are the source of what it is.

To understand them, you need to know your emotional life, which ABC rebuilds through testimony from relatives.
The young Galilean, 30 years old, started a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Túñez, an industrial.
They've been for a year.
When they left him, soon it was assumed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
It wasn't too late for another novelty.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a nearby town.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the boy went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the young man stayed with his wife, who even arrived with her for a week in Palma.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance broke, which broke.
In March 2008, he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mossed, because I've come to work."
"When I told you it seemed good, but of course, now you know what is with the child all day and don't have freedom to do what gives him the will."
Then he speaks of a message to the cell phone that just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me a direction to send it to the child."
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving my mother behind, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she says.
In May, he spoke of the return to his people: "I'm going there this week, but I'll only be up to 19, because 20 I have to present a job so I don't lose it."
It's clear that if everything's all right, she's taking her cousin.
"He'll be with whom he should, or be with me, and never in life will happen to me again with anyone who isn't my mother," suspicious intent given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, was reportedly killed on the 10th.
"Cesar is happy on one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll be there (the child) for summer classes, and so I'll save a bit of bread from the cangarian."
The 17th memories and complaints.
"A very great kiss of Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"He says Alberto told you I don't know what videos on the e-mail, see how when he wants to find me, he has to laugh."
The 30th, "The kid's fine, he's going to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
On the Internet you have your messages on blogs dedicated to the soul and the manganese.
He even had one in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where he was called "Muki the prisoner."
"Trade to the galley (epigraph) ".
The last man who has married her, keeps her sworn, declares her burden to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything has happened because he didn't tell him that he was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial prison in Palma, from the centre of juvenile justice.
The lawyer of the office, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the facts happened, "we had no intention of causing harm to the child."
Previously, he confessed that he had buried Caesar in the pool and buried his dead in a coffin.
The defense and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 scenes at Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PPP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following the significant increase in votes and MEPs experienced in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already seen the overall view, whether it is slow or not, the perspectives are more positive than they are, since the number of votes this training takes on these commissions often double what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan populace received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomy, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
To maintain this trend at the top, which has been fed by a transmission of PPC votes and the credibility of the PPP electorate, analysts have calculated that if general elections are held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 members at the Congress, while the CIU would also win four (now having 10) and the PPC would lose nothing less than 9 Members (it has 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan square is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, CRC would lose a Member - now has three - while ICV would stay with a Member or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will be held in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the populace can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relevance to the Barcelona Diplomatic, one of the most budgeted administrations for 2011 - EUR 661 million - .
Nationalists and popularists agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose its associations in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
In view of the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this training to lose its representation in the Barcelonan Consortium - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its voting number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to be able to protagonize the return to the Tarragonese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 PSC votes, whose mayor, Angel Ross, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were found on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a Yihadist cell, which, directed from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taibai" (Let), the last of Bombay's attacks that resulted in 106 deaths in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "the Kampai operation", Al Qaida's falsification device has been "debted" internationally and, therefore, its operational capacity.
Researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell has been active in Catalunia, the cell has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they have been falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that their "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The detached cell is not the only one that the Yihadist network had operational in Europe, so research has participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not clear that in the EU's territory it will be carried out in the next days similar to those developed on the night of last March in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Aguambide), another development took place in Thailand with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikallaya Kijbumrung.
These were those who directed the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly stolen by tourists who met the requirements of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents were to be in the number of varones between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without printed faces.
According to the investigation, no data has been found that, at the moment, there has been no connection to the arrests in Catalunya with Bombay's attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taibai", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was carried out, since Catalana was sent through a transfer agency about $1,000 that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police have been involved in extensive documentation.
The PP requires More to park the tax concert
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to expose him personally to Artur More his terms to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already planted during the campaign, who are called upon to give priority to the recovery of the economy and to advance from philo-Supernist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to plant in the Ecuadorian mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples attended the meeting of Artur but with the certainty that he had obtained 18 Members in the elections last Sunday, a figure that was more than enough to be done, since the CIU candidate needed at least one of the trainings that would take the opposition to abstain from the vote on investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but the talks that these days hold More with the rest of the political leaders are held in Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, in order to support an investment "all sovereign and independent talks must be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to the Basque country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders generally have their appeal to extend the political apparatus of a very inflated self-government and to eliminate the tax on succession and donations.
Details of Mas investment negotiations will be taken by PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a firm opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and will do so today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidariat Catalana).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not due to "a failure of action"
The owners of the center of Olot do not lose that their cell phone killed more than 11 years old
The hierarchy officials of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press round yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least nine elders who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the centre's letter, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat could make charges against the responsible person" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social disadvantage that the entity may suffer because of not having detected in time the criminal activities of the celler, the great threat to La Caritat now covers a substantial form of compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime was withdrawn in August 2009 and that he has not been killed since then.
The judge had already pointed to the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients in the geriatric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor had personally explored the missing but that, looking at the age and pathologies of the patients, the telephone tract had disappeared.
Caritat, through her director, recently rejected this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures could have never been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no single indication that there has been an unwise action by any other person who is not the imputed person".
The already baptized "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders in advance and explained that the first crime committed him on August 29, 2009 for a month and a half later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, death caused a overdose of insulin, in contrast with the first crime that was committed by aiding a mixture of sedentary pills.
The Director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
Insulin pinches and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes the nurse used to relieve the suffering of the insides used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis being carried out in the lab that will clarify whether Vila didn't mind and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she cut them off by giving them away as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who died between 12 and 17 October.
In the Caritat, they do not give credibility to the events of the cell phone, even to the number of convicted murders, which do not disappear to be higher, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the judge and in the little sense that he has to change his way of doing after he has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is made available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is at risk
Investors reacted bitterly yesterday to Trichet's yesterday threat that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differences have been strongly closed and European banks' actions have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has only represented what is a disturbing sign.
What has been produced yesterday is itself from an illegal market which is as deploreable but motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures, and it will have to be withdrawn for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan by inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding liquidity measures over time and leaving only limited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will extend "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly ceiling with limited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bonus purchase program and even in the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will review the excellent response of the markets in the morning and if they continue to be forgotten by withdrawing liquidity measures, God is with us!
As at its May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonuses and that they had broken the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced Monday and Wednesday that he had bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday's letter surplus to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasure only issued 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous ceiling.
Even so, the Portuguese guys dropped 30 basic points across the curve, reflecting clearly a change of market feeling after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland strike have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million short-term and some 15,000 potentials and are until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension facing the next Heads of State and Government Summit on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are a union and that we are all playing the same game.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy charm.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatization, measures to re-activise employment sound to investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bols have risen by 4.5%, the second that the rest of the European Bols have.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and persistent and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key key to a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we expect it to be resolved with strong demand and help to resolve doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be self-inimulation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasure has more than 40,000 million available liquids than the triple available in March, to some of us, and closes your access to the markets without day.
However, the strategy must continue to be the wife of Caesar, "in addition to being, to think of it."
Come on, we can.
The President of Eulen will challenge the meeting of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The temporary is not in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, when he considers it "full right-wing", the trial meeting of El Enebro on the next 16th day requested by five of his seven children and in which he will try to evaluate his majority and deal with the bodies of management of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia signature.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary Joseph are finishing the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their struggle for control of the group.
The founder of the largest business service holding of the company does not appear to be willing to settle in its dispute to be present in the government bodies of El Enebro.
Of its board of directors, five of its seven children were dismissed, who were appointed administrators in the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year and whose prosecution is recorded in the Mercantil Register.
The trial meeting of El Enebro for the next 16 days, convened by the Judge of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of tournaments within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the call for the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "unexpected resource of the applicants for, through procedural argument, a clear violation of the Law and abuse of law, attempting to ratify and heal the radically zero meeting on 18 January", according to their official interpreters.
This argument will be the basis for it, once the meeting is held, to be challenged by the view that it is "the rule of law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the judge convened a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the parent and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicily, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100 per cent of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims that the use of 51 per cent of the capital is based on family protocols.
This is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide once the view on the appeal is held, for which no date has yet been stated.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with Siemens' secret weapon
A software designs improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull failed in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selection of speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a recent shelter arrived and, despite the rising trajectory of the last few days, the last November, in the final right of the champion, all fled by the triumph of Ferrari del Fernando Alonso.
Without neglecting the ability as a pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor of the ability of the Renault engine to propel his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of high-mobility competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to play, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding inevitable errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's planes or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factor has enabled Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the race and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 the escorts had an average of 10 technicians in their equipment capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each period.
In Red Bull's team, 180 high-quality professional young people work today that, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design all kinds of changes in the balls.
Siemens' director explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull balls except the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can take place from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autokeys.
As the only limitation of this technology development gap is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much at each stage to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce his balls in a location some 50 kilometres from London.
It is two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The template for this comet is up to 580 people, including its two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the enormous technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has served as a service of their participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is unestimable and their zero notority are hidden.
The factory's technology chief, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that I+D's advances in road cars brought 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology is 85% successful, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettels or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because they're "impossible gladiators".
HP will install in two 20 years own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive partnership store is his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade networks between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set an example of the remodeled shop located in the Great Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to place 200 branding points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opening was Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HP Personal Systems also ensured that the philosophy to install shops will always be the same, supporting a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The American advisory group is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it would be a French system and pointed out that the exclusive trading network intends to "improve customer service and pymes in the purchase, attention, sponsorship and even packaging".
Barcelona's shop includes a space with a global pioneer pilot programme, which is responsible for addressing potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes be delayed for up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for pymes and users, as large companies already have technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell is accused of stealing a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directives, the deputy advisor of Banko Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially removes a new liquidity crisis and vatifies the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, there is a decline in interest margins, which will try to compensate partly with commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects three years to catch a million individual customers, its outstanding assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will be in force for three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to win market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank - their large remaining assignment, as so far had been more mixed with SMEs and businesses than the minority customer.
This year has taken 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in enterprises more than 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is the decline in productivity, or the same, of austerity, with reduced costs as a target, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when the performance of the exercise is presented.
Several banks are now attempting to set goals and make them public because the financial crisis has hampered all plans of the world bank.
Sabadell will, in fact, close this year's Optima Director's plan, fixed four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has expanded it for a further period.
Customers who let the storage boxes escape will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "hard and transient year".
The executive actually believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something essential for the survival of banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the war of the Pasavo - which penalizes the Margens - is reducing, the price of the risk premiums that are being paid by banks and boxes for their emissions for liquidity is already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the decline of the Margentes.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the flu, but the differences are higher," acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto already gave the Thursday orders to his network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials - see Fridays of 22 and 27 November -.
He also recognized that the bank's trend is now "to raise commissions", but "there's a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not dispose of corporate operations.
In the bathroom, make sure that in Spain "you're going to need bigger sizes."
"The coming year will move everything," he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very low" and does not disappear that some Spanish financial entity is in red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can add to the market in the capture of funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important to what some Vatican banks already have as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, funding can be obtained for a short period of time through rest, which causes the crisis.
The ECSC depletes a second fusion oil in boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, withdrew yesterday to produce an oil of storage boxes and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of Spanish storage boxes began, several entities were assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation de Cajas de Ahorros (ECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, withdrew yesterday that this new oil of operations would be produced.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the inclusion of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank Group cannot be said to be a second round, which is what is being adjusted."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that instead of 17 we are going to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been done and protected by the Spanish Bank, in which it has cooperated a lot," the director pointed out.
In statements during a resolution of the Aragon and Executive Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is being pursued "as soon as possible, and we need to be very satisfied with how it is going to be done in the times of its day, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
"To pass from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities in a 62% to be much larger to meet Basilea," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of very few successful opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The head of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and the "probably" of the world, and gave it to those who put it in court a "failure of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic context, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and storage boxes, a system that has undertaken a "most important" concentration process and that "go as fast as possible".
It also recalled that the Spanish bank had very well stopped the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
German Red Line and Zapatero
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to pymes, regulation of private agencies for placement or removal of EUR 426 assistance to non-performance facilities, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Loteria.
In addition, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of President Felipe González, has taken the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility in eliminating the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It goes forward that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of terror in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what his future should be, which shocks her from maintaining the old traditions of good part of her partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about the three possible exits to the crisis.
First, a strong euro, integrated by it, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, is close to 50% of the population.
Thirdly, the euro is redesigned, in line with the proposals made by the macro-economic sisters, the budgetary burden, many of the countries that are in transit, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so that now they do not apologize.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government took out of hand a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from leaving 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done ( fiscal and financial stability plans), and what was being practiced by its European partners, including France.
The second in front of him was the central European country when Merkel severely extended the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of critical irons, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and publication were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, a new Merkel emerges with a clear position requiring reform of the Union treaties to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, as the Irish crisis has been precipitated and everything else.
But its proposal, although so well-educated, has been adopted and we should be involved in the Union reform process which enables those measures since 2013.
Germany has crossed a red line that doesn't want to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures with which it may not be very agreed, since that date the former operation of the euro has been completed.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area where criminal countries are severely punished, they may be obliged to declare outstanding payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumer moderation, productivity improvements and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative, based on debt and construction, with huge increases in the balance of payments, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply will not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong if we didn't understand.
This is not just a reduction of public deficit by 3 per cent in 2013.
What they require is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that current turbulence will bring more peace.
And let's take advantage of the opportunity window they have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that despite criticisms to Merkel, the issue of order has been raised on the way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are to be met, leaving a highly developed monetary area of little serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that he has already warned us.
Sports and law fraud
Treats like those of Alonso and Ramos in front of the Ajax show engineering but they don't want to escape a penalty.
The alleged exodus by two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party discussed on 23 November against the Ajax in the Campeones League has caused dozens of ink streams to be written about whether or not such behavior is anti-deportable and whether, if possible, both players should be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in just a few minutes to finish the game (his team had already been clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in the time of sending missing messages to cause the arbitor to show them the second yellow card.
In that way, and since the King Madrid will now be the leader of his group, both players will perform the regular penalty for the next party of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass card cleaning at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sentenced two parties to the team's trainer, José Mourinho, and various economic quantities to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but more often in the football world.
It is so extensive that it forms part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed by this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is that it has been protagonized by a team of the entity of the Real Madrid (which in its charm is considered noble and honorable, and has in the past plagued its players by similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, which, by Mourinho, seems to add an episode to its much more detailed history of hysteronic and provocatoric techniques.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether such behavior is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such acts are a violation of law; in fact, they are actions that respect the rules of sport, but they seem to avoid their meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of damage caused by the sport spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, which is the aspect of which with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that are taken with the clean game is to avoid the use of the criminal player's equipment in an unfair way from the opposite team, which has not happened.
Now, the paradoxical of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it is not what we normally characterize as a fraud or a fraud of law, because its violation of the rules has not been hidden to try to avoid punishment, but that it was precisely its action to be the most evident in order to receive the sentence of the arbitor.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders receive in the intended errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not in a disadvantage to the rival or benefit in the same party, since the result of the action is obviously intended to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count on those players.
The advantage is, of course, that players will start the next phase of the Campeones League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, since the team can be removed from the first change, and in addition with this act players perform a penalty party and pass the second card cycle, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with less than in the first cycle.
So, by going rounds, it's not so clear that it's a win.
In the end, these actions are not against the sports spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that promote the greatest benefit from what rules allow.
In assuming we are concerned, players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without ordering the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of engineering.
It seems to me that there are two factors: because it was two self-exultations and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offence of tenders to catch group navigation scenes in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship focuses this year on a reserve balance for days 16 and 17.
They provide self-sustained celebrations for employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tournament and the lottery arrived in December, they also returned to the pre-Navida group dinners, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have fallen into an adjusted price offense to be able to capture the majority client: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the companies and associations of the sector interviewed.
In order to make this year's calendar (at the fall of Nochevieja in Friday) more complicated, the applications were concentrated on the week of 13 December, with the result that a range of dinner reservations for the days to come (the 16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already occurred since 2008, when the phase of bottlenecks began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective scenes by budgetary question.
In order not to be influenced by tradition, many workers keep it paying for their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, one and the other require war prices, the president of the Barcelona Restoration Group, Gaietà Farrás, confirmed.
The representative of the patronage today is not ashamed to see how this month's festivals will be celebrated.
"People think so much before they book."
"He wants to go out but has the alerts set out in the price issue," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give good price and good service", he adds, and he recalls that customers tend to take a step down with the crisis, so that the gap around 25 euros has become most of the demand.
In a survey in various central institutions, the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
In the sub-group, there is a genuine round of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, which they have responded to by adapting their menus to the merger, with full forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In addition to the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hotel de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has taken more early, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they explain.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, optimists are maintained after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group point out that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of group of friends who celebrate the parties.
In its six group menus, a fleet of EUR 30 or more has been added, and the perception that there is a forecast to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as a cave, has been added.
There are also green holes in some companies that call back on their employees and feel that the volume of groups is something bigger.
On the other hand, Master Facasarm (including entities such as the Bares Association, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona), his vice-president, Enric Goma, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that the reserves are "animals", although customers "next business".
Yes, the illusion for the parties has not gone down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
Wikileaks' filtrations confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concern that the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington causes.
Apart from the clarifications and judicious details of the content of the talks and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries on nuclear safety, rather than increasing, "decrease", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - which weapons are not collected but remain stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This is how Ambassador Anne W. Patterson listed it in a previous report on the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the Taliban attack, the sudden dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is now being considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a prolific reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The latest documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapons production.
A discount from the embassies in May, which qualifies as "frustant" communication with Pakistan, maintains: "Transparency is often absent; aid offers are either unresponsible or dissociated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a speed faster than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who left "very clear" to the responsible person that "the Pakistani Army should end with tactical support to terrorist groups".
To the house of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow Assange's movements.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's only the date of 20 November.
And it does not have to be seen with the latest filtering of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' Creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police body with headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or localizing Assange "in view of their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, as the organization has explained, consider the so-called network notice free to proceed to an arrest -- which should be brought to the national police body, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has angered Assange lawyers, who published a letter yesterday saying that Wikileaks' 39-year-old founder has been willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a castle, not a legal persecution," she complained.
While the world is looking for him -and from Australia his mother defends his child's innocence--Assange is still in an unknown paradox, but not closed.
Monday gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype from an uncertain location, where he asked the U.S. State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, to leave.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the United Nations in violation of international treaties signed by the United States, it should be rejected," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "reductive and absurd" the request for exemption.
"I'm not quite sure why we should import the opinion of a type with a web page," said the CNN chain.
Obama himself has been charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent new fugitives of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman from January to chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, has requested the Department of State to study the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue any contribution or assistance to them".
Later he went to Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's adviser, Stephen Harper, who had to come back after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, ex-prisoner of Arkansas and possibly a candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not execution would be a very kind punishment," he said in the Fox chain.
Poigcercós seeks peace in ERRC with clues to Carod's accessions
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural execution and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to sort out the most intense internal revolution in the ERCs, without north of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party's president is aware that his resignation secret is not enough for the officers to exlider Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is as dazzled today as his own mentor and that he can in fact cause headaches that he had with other external currents.
As a result, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with guides that allow him to be blind to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national counselors of the ERC could be spoken about their continuity in secret.
By means of paper, and not by raised hand.
If cartoonists want to take a certain vote of punishment to the President, they can do so without fear of repressions.
In fact, the row leader wants to avoid the image of division as well as submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered to be ratified by the majority of the votes, but added, without the need for percentages, that would not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
Close friends to Carod require the president something more than putting them in charge of the military, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ among congresses.
But when the majority do not have enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map from here to May.
To that end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the Directorate will vote on Day 18 of the National Council.
Its intention is to evaluate Puigcercós rather than that this promise slows down the convention in autumn 2011, something that the couple already do.
The ECC leader recognized that "polophony" was damaging stability and that its objective was to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash the dirty steps of the gates into the inside.
In this line, the article that the function consultant Joseph Huguet signed on his blog is symmetrical.
In view of Puigcercós' ideology, the Innovation holder gave the fact that the leader will be returned "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five of the two.
First, "recompile" the executive to represent at least 90 per cent of the military, that is, including new faces coming from the sector near Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that the assembly be liquidated once as a operating mechanism.
Thus, it proposes a reform of the statutes that allow conventions to be held through delegates elected by sub-Saharan Africa.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two conventions.
In fact, the 2008 Conciliation Conciliation left the task of reviewing the assembly at a specific convention of reform of the Statutes.
This is still continuing, as the internal sea in recent years was not recommended to deal with the matter.
Now, without critical sectors in the dark, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 completed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the contents of MIMILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease in four cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November 23 persons were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILLENIO State of Mexico.

Along with him the agents found a cartridge with a message.
Maintaining China's objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country at COP16 assured her country that her country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon dioxide and explained that she supported her offer to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 per cent for 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), His Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon dioxide and convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, her country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it was clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He pointed out that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all of this, progress has been made, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which sets out the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with the states and locals to achieve energy savings goals, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, it is now in progress or has already concluded several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by Governments of other countries.
For example, it referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had been invested by the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial project of climate change is also under way, another for the change of indistinguishing focus by rescuers and one more mitigation and adaptation, detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of that country on climate change, ensured that China's efforts have been greater than is generally expected.
For example, exposure to greenhouse gas emissions in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
He has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and planning to do so much more by 2020, he has grown.
The Legality Explosion of Espino: César Nava
The PAN national leader explained that the former Panist leader was in his right to appeal to the National Order Commission what his right was to be.
PAN's national leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientes' expulsion was linked to the legality and that the former Panist leader was entitled to join the National Order Commission to claim what his right was to do.
In an interview before the protest took place by Gabino Cué Monteagido as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken in the local area.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal, in his case, to the Commission of the National Council's Orders, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that there was never an alliance for the presidential candidate at the negotiating table.
Ship Vázquez was said to be convinced that National Action will be strengthened by the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which it will have to be elected to its successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a theme that I have never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was a settlement for the local election that was successful and achieved the goal," he said.
The Panist leader pointed out that PAN has supported him for 71 years of dialogue, so "do not be afraid of internal competition; "we enjoy it and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the Council would no doubt be able to choose the best or best leader that the National Action required for the next three years, so he would deliver the staff "to whom the Council decides."
"I have that absolute peace and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over to the office of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the response recorded by the party in the past elections on 4 July will be reflected in the next contents, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"So now we're going to join Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments issued alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause of observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabon will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the criticisms of PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called the priests to reflect on the sexes of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than Fox and Calderón; they start defending them; they get out of the closet," he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive could make statements like he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no murder or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law in favour of undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and ask them to adopt it is legislation," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has today joined the national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act law, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act law is appropriate, call your senators and set them up to adopt it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its brief message maintains a cyberlink with a wider document that requires the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote in legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," she said.
The message was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and government funding is approved.
This blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs assured that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be set.
"I think there's been a long time..."
"We all agreed that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would ask for a "closed vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the U.S. Dream Law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the sponsors require 60 votes in favour of the initiative, so they require the award of a coup d'état, while the project's party organizations protagonize an intensive capacity to ensure the adoption of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 scenes.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, the parties to the Dream Act require several Republicans to submit to the initiative if other democracies decide to support the initiative.
Among the most deprived Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator George Lemieux from Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position right now.
Although the Chamber of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put the finger on the ledge
The second round of The pleasure of the language was a passage where participants made fun of the narrative
"That of Sex in the Language I understand it but... the finger in the tongue? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the title of his question (in another fair the round table dedicated to Sex in the language, he explained).
The finger on the ledge... "Puts us in apriests," looked sweetly upon the Argentine writer to the public, mostly of young people, who was quoted at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate round table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he gave to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who sought to know what the "laga" is, he goes from doctor to doctor, who does not get answers even though he tracks in the same narrative.
The infectologist is convinced that "patience is not my strength, maybe it's my fault".
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen the relief in the middle of the passport, but who makes it clear that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The llaga is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded that "from the tears I only got to know that it's real open and that it doesn't exist", but convinced that the pleasures and language tramps should go very busy.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delicate narrative entitled Praise of the invention, where the finger on the ledge is not named but at a time it is discovered.
With paintings of magical realism, the account of a famous horseman, who also touched clouds, brought back to men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a doll, a story he had seen to speak later in America, the great novel that had not been missed since the beginning by his own chroniclers who told him and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticised the excess of the account by the conquerors.
"Servants who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fictional witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise never had come to tell the story of America with imagination what he had missed until the dust."
However, he highlighted "the crazy and the embusters who best imagine" and is where it becomes reality and lies, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its support.
It's actually called the Cervantine tradition.
"For his heritage, we are all counted."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero quoted and praised the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the ledge.
The Cuban-Portrait pointed to the great wave of social violence that has passed through his country - and share Latin America - a product of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs will end up a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he indicated, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this latter.
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed it, whose intervention also highlighted "from that finger in the reading of the writer's compromised writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in captivity, also in intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that shrinks into dogmas, forgetting "that behind every statement there is a small one not, and behind every denial there is a small one."
"To be possessed of our thinking and to be possessed of the reality we have to mattify: and mating often means putting your finger on the bed and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, white and black, in established ideas and without math, and also bothering the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three final hits, he's got heights in his career, but he's already known to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the grief of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles marked by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three final hits, he's got high on his career, but he's already known to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he's gone white and that's why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentina has finished consoled itself with the medal of the sub camp, has taken a step behind the winners, and curiously with the same team has played the finals.
The Santista strategy came to its first stage as a trainer in the Tourneo Opentura 2002, when it carried the Morelia Reeds with which it fell by global 4-2 before Toluca; later, in Clousura 2003 it also suffered decisive pain and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was exactly before Rayados.
With Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, Rubén once again suffered a relapse, as his team ended up empathized 2-2 before the players after 210 minutes of the game, but in the gang of penalists he was placed on the ground by 3-1 with two opportunities to watch the title for his three players finally failed from the 11 steps and suffered the turn 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to learn from the illness and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to get out of the camp, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an attachment to which I owe me, and therefore the title will come to me, but the previous is the most important," said the principal when he was asked about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very living has the previous end, which, assuring, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the Arbitor passes the end we can't celebrate, we're ready for the dance, the players too, because the previous time, with two punishments for shooting we were already ready to run out and I think it's a teaching, until the party is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shootings, something that doesn't bother you, because it trusts its players: "One never tries to get to the crime scene, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other one, and there must be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game of fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but if it was us, it left us something for this end that we expect not to reach that stage".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a technical sub camp and to try for the first time the glory he gives the titles.
EU changes rules to get visas
People should visit the Service Centres for Visa Seekers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time.
From 10 January 2011 it will change the procedure for the transmission of a visa to the United States Embassy and consular.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants should visit the Visa Requesting Service Centres (ASC, for their signals in English) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of transmissing visas will be lower, and payment will no longer be required to negotiate the visa, other payment to process visa applications and more so that the message service will deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visas will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only visit the ASC nearest where they will present their documents and take their shoes.
Given that biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain at this time less than in the past.
Similarly, those who request visas from the Consulates in Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new procedure to request a visa, visit the following page: http://Mexico.usembassy.gov/boletins/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce extraterrestrial life experience
The U.S. Space Agency quoted the press to introduce a meeting tomorrow that would have an impact on the search for living living creatures in the space.
The U.S. National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will inform you tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life exists.
The meeting will be presented in a tomorrow morning press round at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astronomy, science described as the task of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In citing the press, NASA ensured that it would present "a finding that would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which led to speculations by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures on our side and in hostile environments that were thought impossible, and would put the possibility of becoming intelligent as humans if they improved the conditions in which they lived.
It seems that it is a microbio that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was too venous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, creation uses the arsenic as a way of survival and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other planets, which do not have our favourable atmosphere.
According to astronomers, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will let you know the real extent of the findings at the Thursday morning press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon in Saturn), under the view that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, instead of the arrival of 'bipartidism', they complain.
The 60 legislation was not installed when an opposition block was set up at Congress, headed by MPs PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared independent, and the four asked one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' in the Chamber.
Before starting the 60-legislation session, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'trenaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they repeated, starting with 'bipartidism', because now there will be two people, of the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only votes against the Board of Directors, headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, he explained that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN party.
He pointed out that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they did not, then they would be rescinded by both parties and thus the opposition coalition ended.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, even having the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Philip Manzanez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore they are in line with a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it continued, that after being monopolistic, Congress is now a 'double'.
"It is not the spirit of reform of the law that has an eternal Bipathy in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are chatting with other partners and colleagues to be more, the convergent has grown.
Ezekiel Reynos Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'botin' between two, in addition to the PAN and PRI.
"It was just a game, now if they're dividing it between two."
Mr. Montalvo, who was asked to respect the representative's personality, was given his place at the negotiating table.
"That is not because of copular agreements, we are left out of 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, and we are urged by the five who see us, separated from different factions, we have decided to unify ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the subject that in the reform they have agreed to, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform."
Salen $200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Pay an additional check with the owner of an electrical material company.
A check of more than 200 thousand people in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the Association.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company is up to 1 million,200,000 pounds.
According to the municipality's Transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 by the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 weights, under the concept of "payment of accounts for payment".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced to pay more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Supreme Auditorium for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing due to being sent in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, it's just paying for what it deserves, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "represented" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as stated in the Law when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other Governments from using their services, the Treasurer has ensured that they have not re-use their services.
The previous, after that on 25 July, Noroest published a review of the checks issued by the Association to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, at the trial of Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality paid to Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million people, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million weights.
Need to visit tourist sites
They complain that tourists have been affected by the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada Glorieta in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a cavern of the Sánchez Taboada Valley, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad condition and to design a bad image from the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Dora area, recalled that on different occasions, they have complained that the image of destination is being taken care of and that the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists are going through and see the mess and bring him back to close business.
"Politics don't know what one day a company is closing up and they don't have the idea of losing the diner, or otherwise they won't do the work so long and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's fall revealed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Association.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not only falling into correction," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the Assembly must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that also shine in ignorance and incompetence, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadido de Mazatlán.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has purity in its beaches, its advantages, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
"No due attention has been given, and this kind of fact points to something that is unknown to all, maintenance is missing."
Raúl Lerra Martínez, Deputy Secretary for Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, since they are not properly exploited and they are planning a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city on the day, clean, ordered and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Successfully Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive so that they can add to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the ECE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Signaloa for the various challenges they face.
A decent and free labour legislation between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 MPs of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, has been installed.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they will be able to carry out clean management and commitment with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partnership or parentalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that 40 foreign members of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Signaloa for the various challenges they face.
"We hope that Members will actually exercise their right, free agreement between the parties, because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become charismatic representatives of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He therefore said that they confirmed the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that they would take forward to the Governor in turn.
"We are concerned that they come to do a decent job, especially committed to society and the sectors, because they were the signalians who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and collect forces to seek the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complex.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in some way encourage the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators should weigh within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lower budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and a generator of divide and investment and that it directly competes with industrial agriculture."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for decent tourist projects and to assist them in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcoholic Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.
Searching for a bad king
Muenques, cars and bicycles, among other players, are the children's wish from the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Day of Kingdoms will be difficult to satisfy their illusions, as their home is conformed to nothing more than 12 people and a chivo.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so much desire.
The family lives in a humble home of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives on the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have a shirt, but we're selling Mandarin and Dad... already tomorrow I'm going out with 'pebes' to sell the street," said Cayetsana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, aged 4, wants a mummy or a bike, while her 3-year-old sister, Isabel, would like a mummy Barbie.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long dreamed of having a 'monster' car and for his brother Jesús, of 8 months old, Cayetana suggests style for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like this monster', but I told him 'we'll see the child', because he was very facey,' he recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, those who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, aged 11, is size 12; Isaiah, age 10, while Miguel, aged 8, uses size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, misses you, so a couple of such five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family possible to participate in the campaign Search for a King Mago, giving a game or an effective reception in Noroeste.
Fourteen drug trafficking suspects detained
Wednesday, in Estonia, a decade of persecution has taken place in the context of the dismantling of a network of Cannabis production and sales.
Forty persons who will face various charges have been arrested.
Persecution has occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 Cannabis plants, four kilograms of hachis, money and equipment for production have been planted," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a representative of Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two network leaders, two Sherbrooke's men, have been arrested.
The detainees had to be compared to Sherbrooke's courthouse in the following hours of his arrest.
Cannabis production charges, possession with the object of trafficking, theft and theft of services, among others, could be dealt with.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted for nearly a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out arrests," Mr. Ruel said.
In this police operation, about seventy agents participated in the Quebec Security Research Module, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphremagog Police Department.
You can fight against clandestine migration without problems
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of clandestine migrant patterns, will surely face a great opposition, since the three parties to the opposition have announced the Wednesdays they could not support.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I'm here with a party that has created the granite that you're pissing," said liberal director Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the Caucas.
The liberals argue that the draft law in its current form, which would allow for up to one year to any person coming from a ship identified as the transport of foreigners, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong white.
"We are against and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with clandestine immigrants.
"Neodemocrats agree that measures are being taken against the defendants of clandestine patents, and that is what we intend with another bill, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the bill of conservators because it attacks refugees and prisons children for at least one year," said Mrs. Chow.
Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position to play politicians and make cases against the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a fraud."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its refusal.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote in order for each candidate to object to be explained later to his voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January.
The Metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, March's announcement has come as a surprise to more than one.
It should be said that, during a permanent meeting of the Council on Quebec's police services held last October 29th, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough to make the criticism of the Quebec party that dealt with the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, qualified this ad as "a couple pulled out of the chistera" and as "a last-hour chapter solution".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public investigation.
"The more Mr Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this research committee, the more people share our opinion, the more he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to leave Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, it suggests Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general intervention to carry out an investigation on corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concluded.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent table is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request seems to be made by the officer of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the court is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed by his part that his Honorary Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently committed to making certain amendments to this subject.
During the spring 2001 operation related to motor groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were detained.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being closely monitored because of the strong precipitation that has been registered in several regions of the province since March.
The Wednesday afternoon a earthquake occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have been evacuated from their homes.
During the night another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded strong precipitations, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, additional 20 to 40 millimetres are expected from now to Thursday at night, depending on the region.
The sectors located in the north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were the most affected.
They could get up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these precipitations are combined with the snow drop which has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will be disintegrated.
On Wednesday night, Quebec's Civil Security Unit issued alerts to the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, strong precipitations have caused the disintegration of certain lakes in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the mighty floods have drawn a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Otaouais, the depletion of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The Civil Security Unit continues to be alert and monitors the situation of proximity, as stated by Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Prevention Centre, by its part, has issued the Wednesday announcements by reporting the increased forces of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Culpan partially in Dupont
The representative of Quebec Stéphane Dupont's radio station has suffered a certain revision to the Canadian Council of Radio Telecommunications Standards (CCNR) by controversial statements relating to social and Haitian assistance, as well as its major language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an inappropriately negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who had been murdered, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Representatives must communicate reliable and not lead to fraud.
In relation to the murder, the presentation by Stéphane Dupont had shown that the murder was a cowardly act.
Most members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes under the heading "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a delicate issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Consequently, any guilt in this regard has been disposed of.
The final dispute referred to the declarations made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media confrontation that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI representative stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not be sure if the needers were really receiving the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an inappropriate negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My messenger has been clean for a year and a half," said the representative.
In all decisions, the Committee condemns the issue of major languages.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "including more than what is required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, inter alia, announce decisions once in larger hearing hours within a period of three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The exhibition of argelino origin Nacerddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, which highlights "sanda" (ung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai box, goes up to the dads and rings of the world looking for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who lives in the Metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek battles everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on land that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as a employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two medals of gold at the World's amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished their first four positions in the last world champion in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the tournament in fifth place, but I reached the third post in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is, I've been making progress in each competition."
"At this stage, I'll be the first one this time or the next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is an original Chinese discipline in which to hit the feet and feet, as well as to launch enemies on the ground.
The confrontations are originally held on a platform and, at least frequently, on a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only hold a competition in his career, he will no doubt lead to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most notable and prestigious," explains the nice boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal won his first battle in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but he lost it at the end.
"What has won me is a real professional," I think.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are faced at the end of their category."
"Then each category's champions are faced with a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without bids
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts of $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts, there is a partnership formed by BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has received without a bid before the most important contract, the project management, for a total of 295 million.
The group, called Energy Management, was created in 2004 on the basis of the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5,000 million hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Corporation obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tenders.
For the Québecian Party, the aid to corporate associations poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and generate a rise in prices.
"It is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said the party member of the Czech Republic Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press round.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the question at the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how public interest could be gained in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalia Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that a collapse has occurred with this contract.
"I'm beginning to get tired," he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "depressively" and "with a lack of strength."
He indicated that "minimum" would be that PQ would apologize.
The formula of the consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Usually, it is an arrangement with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the size of the works.
The work has already begun and will continue until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been granted without competition in the game; it has been negotiated.
In addition, the formula of the consortia has ceased to be the exception to the Quebec standard, even for relatively simple projects.
As he published last week in Le Debor, the formula for associations in the technical advice sector is being submitted to an investigation in the Government.
A quick view of Quebec's market register allows more than 200 associations to be identified, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genival, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the territory of Bahía James responds to a dynamic of particular work and Hydro-Québec has been particularly responsible for it since the 1970s."
The chief executive of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the Baye James Energy Society (SEBJ), has explained that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to an offer and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the actors in the sector and tell them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of over $50,000 obtained by the Cuban Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Debor identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or branches, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genival received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "well known by the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has left that PQ is also linked to these companies, which "financial" before it needs to be better treated than its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. Green tag does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
Consumers rely only on sustainable development actors, as well as on fair trade marks and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is worse. The consumer is subjected to a media universe where they post messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it is even breaking its commitment.
Even if the consumption of "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebeceses seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the company's environmental commitment or the eco-innovation of the companies themselves, reveals the measuring tool developed by the Observatory for the responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates bearing the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands bearing the labels indicating that they are "responsible", notes Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecese politicians' talks on this issue are taken seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about one third of the Cuban consumers.
In fact, gaps and the suspicious nature of information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecese say they also deconferencing the alleged performance of the environmental products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
One 61 per cent has given priority to buying in the shops of their neighborhood and has preferred to buy food grown in their region, notes Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of a hundred years this year), the Human Consumers of Quebec loves to occupy the king's office of recycling who is trying to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be of doors (from your car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of the Quebecese indicated that they had used public transport or shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1 per cent of the participants in this broad behavior survey, which just completed their first edition, supports the use of bicycles and foot-and-mouthings.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has requested financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris film complex by Angus and the parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus and the Parallelle Development Society, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex in the St. Laurent bulla and return his true movie vocation, had not received what they requested.
The Government has agreed to intervene in the matter, but under its own circumstances.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would, in fact, be lower than initial expectations; this could be a viable solution in favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan last spring and a 12.8 million request, but since then the applications have been revised down.
François Macerola, President of the Development Society of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), led by the eXcentris messenger, presented a proposal and action plan to the Minister of St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report ten days ago.
However, the SODEC received a counter-proposal from the office on Tuesday.
The Parallelle and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to answer the same question.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State grant must be completely dismissed.
We recall that Quebec's Association of Film Owners and Filmable Filmrooms was opposed to a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various sector representatives call for considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same company, has been carrying the author's film for ten years in his complex premises, after financing his own building, which could justify a derogation from the Treasure Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films turns out to be patented in Montreal and eXcentris had learned to trust her client.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, push for their part a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "The Men and the Deux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact Le Debor and we do not know what he and his group of proposals to the bottom they have received.
Raised the view of completed Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with regard to the United States, but reflect once again the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think of Canadian-United States relations when they vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the United States Embassy of Ottawa and Washington, which have been made public yesterday, offer better detailed details that are really substantial.
A cable of 22 September 2008 means that, during a full federal electoral campaign, the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"I wish political leaders would be subject to a system of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians at the time of addressing daily domestic issues, instead of leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
Therefore, it concludes that the United States is "the provable elephant of this election: a representative, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "incorrigible silence" because both countries maintain strong political and economic relations.
"Logetically, I think the ability of a candidate, of a party and, more importantly, of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor in which voters should think at the time of voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will contribute to ensuring the survival of the government during the February vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will first register deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000,000," wrote Mr. Breese.
In no way is it mentioned that the Government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid the replacement of coalition or that the parties to the opposition had to make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image that transmits the dramatic series distributed in the United States CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappers for the CIA to make inquiries.
Another cable finds that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French Homologist Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some of Guantánamo's prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that depends on "every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote: "He has delivered a document to the State Secretary in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to review the sender."
Finally, we can mention that the anims have been heated over WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flaangan, a very close former adviser to Stephen Harper, declared in CBC radio that the responsible man of this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's echoes.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GEI) in a number that is virtually equivalent to a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is highlighted in the set of major projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the inductive bombs, still monopolize between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bombs or, even better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED") bombs, would avoid much of the 1,800 million tons (Gt) of GEI emitted on the planet to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70 per cent of the emissions from the planetary automobile park.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce GGEI's overall emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that quantity should be reduced to stabilize the increase in temperatures by 2020 in two centrifugal degrees to avoid decontrolling it.
In incandescent bombs, 95% of energy is separated by heat and the rest, i.e. a 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompetant pumps, energy costs are reduced by 75% and with new LED pumps, energy consumption is still reduced twice more.
Fluocompetition pumps take an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the United Nations study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80 per cent less energy than an indistinguishable bomb, allowing us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also operate with waste and emit very little heat.
Above, they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations with regard to fluocompetant bombs, since they contain mercury and must be removed as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is, not fluocompetant pumps, but carbon thermal centres, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that comes out of the incandescent bombs.
Only in the United States, these centres emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report describes the advantages this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1,000 million a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 heat stations whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Marfil Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of electoral results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa de Marfil, given the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce provisional results immediately," said a spokesman from the United Nations Chief Executive.
"He asks all the parties to Costa de Marfil and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the Wednesday to midnight to spend three days since Sunday's end.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CEO had commented on television that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
Wednesdays have multiplied worldwide the demands that the CEI finally announces the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and its opposition Alassane Ouattar.
However, the gang of Gbagbo has been canceling the constitutional Council ' s "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the failed State attack in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Costa de Marfil, said that the alarming maneuvers of the electors carried out by the United Nations in the north of the country had challenged the followers of the president coming out to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
Now, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political coalition of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who deposes any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies claimed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after it had prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second return from the presidency, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a divided country in two years.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday of the political class in Costa de Marfil that might be considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended on the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alassane Ouattar, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bedié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the corrected data with the provisional static variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops is 2,631,000 in continental France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wish to work, are or are not available in the two weeks to work and seek or not to work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to increase, with a new increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were in constant pain in the sense of ILO.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in peer pressure among older people, up to 6.4 per cent in continental France (+0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, up to 6.6 per cent with DOMs.
Only a pairs of persons aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France, have been registered.
Since 2006, the Insee has not published the monthly pair rate, following a poll on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, continues to do so and has announced a 9.8 per cent rate for France (including DOM) in October, after a 9.9 per cent in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the President-in-Office of the Bouches-du-Rhône Council, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation of public contracts alleged to be fraudulent.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for the abuse of social goods, fund abuse and public property, coverage, active corruption, traffic of influence and ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will answer all the questions raised by the judge, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue you by a multitude of reprehensible acts, something else is to prove them," said AFP his lawyer, Florence Raul, before his client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit a document to the judge, before his appearance, to explain it.
Wednesday night they also began to investigate and jail one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to deal with the vegetables he has to manage.
As regards the award of contracts or the fate of the funds related to their implementation, he does not know anything about it, says the letter Simon.
In the context of this expedition, he is also being investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, because of the abuse of funds and complexity, but has left him in conditional freedom and has been prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have forgiven him."
"The instructor judge has taken into account the explanations and has left him free," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday evening at Wednesday, four others were asked and left free, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of "influence and passive corruption".
Two Aubaglomeration officials, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringeier, have been questioned by "sustainment and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complicity in public funds abuse", respectively.
Finally, the company of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corcega.
Investigators suspect that their companies have a service to whiteen the capital of the great banditism.
The investigation is under several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that research focuses particularly on the conditions of the assignment and operation of a vertigo in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities of the Marsella urban community (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for "espionage", has been in force to the public in France, has warned of diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attention of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the United States to the point of giving them advice to manage their own crisis of "rehens" in Iran (a small group of senders).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youth did not occur in exchange for the liberation of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by US justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram edited on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of revenge".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic matters, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interviewed the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the US to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held in force in Iran.
"Let it sound," they say, "always" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "in ignorance", "immediate liberation".
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still."
Because once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "silence won't solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "an ordinary Iranian tactic: the take of hostages for political singing".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will be held on 16 August, the day on which he will flee to the Embassy of France) "will require the subscription to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
In addition, she notes that Elisha anticipates other crisis of reigns, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of jail after twelve days, but he's locked up in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for illicit trafficking of electronic material sensitive to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The United States embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iranian clandestine networks for the nuclear programme, the excavation of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free Iranians instead of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
Elisha, he says, not only has "he been greatly surprised by the decision of the judge", but has tried to oppose himself.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision", he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French information services.
The Councillor of Eliseo marks a number of telephone calls, calls, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently in Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss's arrest in Iran, Eliseo is not exaggerating in efforts, uses communications and "fugas" organized in the media to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The U.S. observed this activity with some irony and verified that manipulation brings its fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the average blitz" of French officials.
Assad is entitled to such "thanks" to Mr. Assad, the embassies in Paris are asked.
"In spite of their full statements of praise, French officials recognize in private that they only have a false idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to stand on this foot.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria", he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, has just been closed to premature and unappreciative".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praise that can be collected if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "smell the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows him well.
On 11 August François Richier trusted him: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, if we're grateful."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her at Elisha.
In a communiqué, it is grateful to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria that they have played a "active role in the release of our compatriot".
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cenicenta" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gambling companies to block access to those games after midnight to youths under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many kids play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Ministerial Officer responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, as required.
The Government is also planning to ask companies that limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, the responsible added.
In addition, it will be made available to those who request free computer programs that allow them to limit Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly give news of various events linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the indisputable champion of world online games competitions.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals at World Cyber Games, where it faced another 58 countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designations to host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the doubts of corruption, the Executive Committee of the FIFA appoints Thursday to the host countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where the struggle for influence and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear: the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional heritage of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Portugal and the Netherlands).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after an outbreak in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or in the East East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities forming part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's emir, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World.
Transactions between vessels, therefore, are possible to last up to the last minute.
On the other hand, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese candidates (2018) and US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have destroyed the opportunities of his country, regardless of football, which only once welcomed the World, in 1966.
The BBC added a line on Monday when a document was circulated to three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to hate FIFA and humiliate the English responsible, who have launched an intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in his head.
The Head of Government is looking forward to re-editing the successful hit by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had succeeded in 2005 for London the JJ.O. 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to recover England's brightness before the EC?
It is not clear, since the two Spanish-Portuguals also have many strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the economic and financial perspectives of both countries could fall below their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English and the doubts about Spain and Portugal's solvency are the only way to give points to Russia, converted into a weight outsider in spite of the gaps in its application (stars, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and has declared a "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct appeal to the English press charges against EC members.
"They're taking off their suctions, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has experience in 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of the FIFA seems to be the advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new candidates appear to be premature for two countries that have organized the seminar together in 2002.
Another risk: the 2026 World concession to China, strongly desired by the FIFA, would cause Asia to remain unencumbered for 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on future stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries are more likely to be in danger than you are.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of paid TV rights (in view of the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the FIFA war.
Second assignment: the test
Of Gaulle really had doubts.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he had doubts.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less.
An assignment in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current Head of State will be re-elected in 2012.
However, evidence of this does not match well with the mystery often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it is always necessary to show that you have doubts.
On the one hand and on the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not withdraw a third mandate.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some point in October 2011".
Therefore, the fact that it deals with MPs, Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to a certain revolution.
Is this the official announcement of your application?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of mandates of five years.
Just transmit the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time I'm talking about the presidentials, with a playful tone, in encounters of this kind.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still be seven and a half years with me," had been released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "You didn't think I was going to plant what would happen later."
Your previous statements do not draw you any closer to the candidate, nor are they less.
They suggest comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race by candidate in the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone down to the hall what brings Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
On the contrary, the fact that its candidate in 2012 is clear is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organized before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon's application to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the topic in the UMP," has responded immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be invited," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always think he can win," says Alain Juppé, quoted before the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is required to maintain its acquisitions of letters from the State
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for determining the exit modalities of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
As a result of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Emission Institute can no doubt not be allowed to be as perientated if it does not want to put an even more complex situation on European debt markets today.
The political cost would be the same.
Yesterday, during a press round, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in solving the debt crisis of European States.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, e.g. increasing its procurement programme for State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
In Brussels, during its hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the purchase programme of State Letter in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we have decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariable type in 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of assets by the ECB has doubled last week to around EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the independent market operators, yesterday it would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities of EUR 67,000 million since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will continue their purchases (see page 29).
The economists also do not foresee any significant change in course.
Although loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's Arsenal, it still carries out limited liquidity allocations under beneficial conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The economists hope that this device will be extended today for a few months.
"I don't think you're going to significantly change your program."
"If not, I would risk causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive exit will occur during the first quarter of 2011,", predicts Norbert Brams, economist in Sal.
Openhouse.
In relation to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of those obligations in order to keep the market stable," Norbert Brams added.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to keep its presence on the market.
"It must compensate any price for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the performance of the most fragile States," he said yesterday.
Because, if the types of interest are placed by the clouds, States will have more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi captures the time
After Italy had begun the week in an alarming manner, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflow of the types of liabilities for 10 years.
A recovery of the peace would be necessary.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents had stated that they had listened to Giulia Tremonti to qualify for the status of "indecipherable" and that it was expected that a week's end would be "imprevisible", statements rejected later by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the long-term German types had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of the cover contracts against the risk of cancer (CRQ) had been dropped to 263 points, causing a certain revolution in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain the difference with the German types was greater than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the slowdown of the income associated with it, causing the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
Brussels's latest forecasts have suggested a cold glass of water for the government.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on figures 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP in the coming year (in contrast to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
It is therefore a dream that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the parties, with a total of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Argo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate or long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested in Italy are smaller than those required in other countries," says Pier Carlo Paduan, head of OECD economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the Chamber of Members, after which elections could be held at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would be open to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press round in Paris: "I think that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, in the evening and in the day, that Europeans are clearly solid, decided, committed to the defence of their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was relative, yesterday's delay in the types of obligations of European States has moved governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a normalization principle.
The Standard Qualification Agency & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common white in the current speculations.
"As in May, there is really a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on bank systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas say.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than market rhythm".
Aware of this crisis and the dangers that it poses, European countries are intensifying the debate to strengthen the existing exit mechanisms of the crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers which are more directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
This also takes into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of the coming week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market corridor (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFEF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has launched a journey by Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the East East of the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, the land is certainly prepared.
The first EAFRD securities emissions are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States has entrusted Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through an additional direct commitment from IMF.
With regard to countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are linked to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid all costs of seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding the structural reforms that they consider necessary to increase confidence in a sustainable manner.
The capitalist partners of the European funds are finally developing the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of public debt markets.
In Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the paper again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor in the European public debt market, consider that an additional EUR 100 million would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently with EUR 60,000 million.
An advice that would certainly be able to examine European capital in detail.
In particular, if market conditions deteriorate.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments in orange alert
The floods continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the UK secondary network, and may affect various economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are in alert oranges due to the risk of snow and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already on the alert, 18 from Wednesday to noon, and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, falling snow forces affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also slightly snow in the Isle of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, at a point between 7 and 10 cm, in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armore, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of the Netherlands, France and Lemosín.
The snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, alert Météo France.
In Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Gingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac horses, has been prohibited.
According to gendarmes, traffic in the UK secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it not be carried out except where necessary and that the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During the summer, school transport in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measure had been provided for the Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
Prefecture "commands all drivers to drive with greater caution on the roads and to adapt their behaviour to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked air carriers to cancel their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to the planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers be contacted with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial wipers
Since the debate on modernization of transport on the French Isle of France has reached its peak, thousands of millions have been struck.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23,000 million for the Great Paris metro which the Great Paris Society must build.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a allocation of €4,000 million.
At the theoretical level, this will be the one that will allow the GSP to receive loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly's Finance Commission this morning, contains the provisions to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices on the Isle of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set out in figures: "The product of this tax is €117 million a year".
The second is an amendment to a tax on offices already existing "to modernise it, increase its product and target that increase to the Society of Great Paris".
How would you get this method?
Who knows?
There are no numbers in the text.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"It is necessary that the tax resources be added to the 4,000 million euros of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and be granted to the Great Paris Society as the project progresses," we can read in the statement of reasons.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time income is created (the two taxes, dllr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explain."
"It shall be registered in the budget and used in accordance with the requirements."
The GDP estimates that it will start to receive 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4,000 million promised are not in credit, can cause a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Sellers and smart spy hackers
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears to be scandalous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each expedition created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is made exclusively by print cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. appearances on the sexual customs of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's otherwise reticulating profile took a lot of time giving horses artists ideas to create their sketches.
The standard under which secret agents should only be trained by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (on the Grid, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This should not be the only reason why the authors of hidden texts do not want to do endless research (or do not know where to look for news about the absentee), but because those who devote themselves to occultism do not just trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret agents.
The informer is perezosic, as is perezic (or has little concern) the chief of secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberation), who only considers a certain thing that can be recognized.
The above-secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US Embassy of Rome to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek last week.
Why, then, have they caused such a revelation to be revealed by these agents?
On the one hand, they only say what every farmer already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State may be called by telephone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, so we just pretend we don't know about hypocresia.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a poor image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country has a significant impact on the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "robbers".
But we're in the real nature of what's happened.
Previously, in Orwell’s time, he could have been conceived of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, having been able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, hotel visited, autopist taken, the citizen would thus become a full victim of power.
But when it is shown, as is now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unilateral and returns to circulation.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the seller of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you resist a power that you can't even keep your own secrets anymore?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, because it comes from the public area; but to discover, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means withdrawing all power.
WikiLeaks has not hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by such powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any information on the network, as it would be like to publish it in a full street.
But it is also evident that, with the current technologies, it cannot be expected to maintain confidential telephone conversations.
Nothing makes it easier to find out whether and when a Head of State has moved into a plane and has been contacted by one of the Homologists.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, at the moment, my forecast is a science fiction thing and, therefore, it's new, but I imagine government agents who are discrepancies with uncontrollable journeys, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as a matter of fact, hiding some data written in the pockets of their shoes.
This information is then stored in a single copy in locked boxes with key: at the end of the accounts, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that technology is currently advancing as a cancer, i.e. back.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has again created a cable-telegraph (telephones).
Video tapes (analogues) had enabled film researchers to study a step-by-step film, advance and retreating, discovering all the mounting secrets, while now the CD (digital) only allows you to advance or retreat from chapter, i.e. huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, with the moves it takes, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual for the policy and communication techniques to bring us back to horse cars.
A final comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on secretly in the embassies.
Currently, they are embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's chappies in their financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the financing promises have been fulfilled rapidly (called fixed start or early) by developed countries.
And the French hats have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to providing EUR 7,200 million in three years and France EUR 1,260 million (i.e. €420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fixed start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press round, a large supplementary event, the distribution of booklets...
Transparency operation was valuable and was appreciated for what it really was: developing countries and civil society wanted all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2,200 million in 2010, which is in the right way to meet its 7.200 million commitment in 2012.
But if we examine the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is made, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each one selects the reference most appropriate to it.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years for fixed start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with regard to the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the costs of previous years or the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), with the intention of respecting its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each which chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each euro delivered is equal to a given euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is possible to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a given euro... As much as, for its commitments, the cost of loans to the country that grants the loan (i.e. equivalent to a type of interest) should be calculated only for its commitments.
However, France does not find such a valid reason: it 'respects' its 420 million euro commitment by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union makes a contribution to the achievement of its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its fixed start funding, France commits a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions in time and on the other, in relation to real financial effort.
By spending as much as EUR 36.1 million, he is able to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional" as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to be Berty who has been occupied by the arbitration) could have a double negative impact within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply provide?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not quite...
The early financing chapter is a short-term dilemma in relation to the whole of climate negotiations.
But it could be a lot of sand in the vast machinery that is the CMNUCC.
We hope it's not like that.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with a view to respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could make progress on the debate on the long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not be exempt from the issue of "additional character" or from the method of counting the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive in Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement on France's fixed start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to advance negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child engages in a day of 81 different chemicals, according to a study published by the Association Generations Futures (the former movement of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrations of the problem treated", acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the food that often consumes a child of about ten years in four meals and a time of day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in the laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or likely cancers and five substances classified as safe cancers, and 37 substances that can act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in virtually all cases, legal limits are not exceeded for each of the chemical substances individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is worrying," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancers and three considered safe cancers, as well as about twenty residues that can damage the hormone system.
The manzana, imported from Brazil, intended as a time for college, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungi in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green Jews, including food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian filtration, ironing, and even the bread bar or chicile were grown with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the flu, the analysis found the presence of nitrates and chlorforms.
In the dinner, the salmon round was the most "nutritional" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwaves was not entirely clean.
The final risk generated by these "continent cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimated", says the study.
The European Association of Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, on its part, proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to prevent "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
