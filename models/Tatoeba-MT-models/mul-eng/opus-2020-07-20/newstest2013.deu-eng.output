A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight elections.
However, Brennan Center lasts for a myth by confirming that elections in the United States are rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
In the United States, in 10 years, Republicans have listed only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One is certain that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of the election.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for implementing the elections in individual countries.
In this sense, most American governments have announced new laws that have made the procedure for registration or departure difficult since 2009.
This phenomenon has gained significance after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives registered in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative provisions were introduced only in 2011 which restricted the exercise of the right of choice in 41 countries.
The new electoral legislation requires that the electors present a light display and a sign of the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for the preliminary vote to declare the right to be registered as voters on the election day, and to speak against the right of citizens to vote for a court act.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has required the voters to present a light display.
Indiana was the first state to make such a request.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities decided to extend this practice to other States.
In the last two years, they have promoted legislative proposals in 34 federal states with which voters are forced to present a light display.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec, do not have a universal visa card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, which means 21 million eligible persons, do not have a visa issued by a government authority of their country.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an indication.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to receive the required payment.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low incomes are being severely affected.
In fact, 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years are not above the required light quality.
That's still enough.
Students who are seen as voters who raise their voices for democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their lighting display issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of angels or hunting units to choose the most powerful for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state of the state has asked for evidence of citizenship for elections.
Arizona was the first state to make such a request.
Since 2011, thousands of States have adopted laws that require voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is on hand that two of three Spanish voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators have promoted legislation in eight federal states, with the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the electoral registration campaigns have contributed to the 2004 general elections to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of new voters' registrations in 2010 has decreased by 17% from 2006 to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the time for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the former voters were African Americans, although only 13% of the federal voters were elected.
The same applies to the Spanish people.
The last was only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens chosen in advance.
In contrast, the whites representing 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their advocates have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several legislative proposals were blocked by the Vetos of the democratic governor.
The U.S. Attorney General has taken action to enforce the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal laws have been adopted, which require the prevention of a lighting system.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt make it difficult to exercise the right of choice.
The democratic critics promote the political nature of the laws adopted and clearly see the impact of the results in the countries that have been excluded for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those countries that have adopted these laws draw 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral segment to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with conviction that these changes to the rule of law in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of the election.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatic pre-recognition: should the test be performed or not?
The PSA test shows that in fact there are sometimes wrong results, with false negative or even negative positive results that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to stronger delays in the conduct of early detection tests by the already unclosed men.
Whether or not to play event sounds.
We have heard the opinion of two experts.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were a number of barriers between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in the mortality of patients with and without prior recognition.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up to 12 years, the probability of metastases education is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend testing from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old when you have a direct connection that has already been affected by prostatic cancer.
In men of African-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to make the risk of his cancer really understandable by showing him the possible options in which prostatic cancers can remain untreated if they do not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is decided to take action to monitor the disease.
Today, many men with whom cancer has been recognized do not have any treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and are offered treatment in advance of disease.
The criteria for a decision which should be dealt with and who should not be more accurately defined.
That is why I still recommend the implementation of the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not to be performed.
In cooperation with the international association for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way of reducing the risk of getting sick to him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone ate well and would move enough.
"If there is no smoke anymore, this value would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian cancer company.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by infection.
Several remain completely unclear.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian cancer company, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after smoking on cigarettes, the risk of death from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer company, obesity and adipositas also promote the outbreak of disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast-, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, breast-feeding, and breast-feeding.
"The research shows that regular physical activity is protecting the entire life against gravitational cancer," he adds.
The food
The organisation also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
To a large extent, it increases the risk of getting sick in a stomach or stomach cancer.
Wursts should also be rented.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Later can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancers.
However, their investigations are currently not final.
According to the Canadian cancer company, the studies of vitamin E are controversial.
While a study revealed a decrease in the risk of prostatic cancer, another increased.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family care.
"The implementation of an early identification test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Box analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has raised a certain view in the last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, one believes that this boson is nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last part, its existence by the standard model - our best or "the least false" statement of nature and the behaviour of matter - is predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicist it's still not absolutely sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physical convention in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be fully secure about it.
Nevertheless, let us see that it is actually about the Higgs, since it appears that there is only a small risk of hiding, and we are looking at what is going on.
In this world, there is a very strong law that makes it impossible for two objects to be at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to ignore this rule - and do not try it too hard because you are getting tired.
Because even if partial physics is a really rare world, it appears that for them there is also such a law: the Pauli's exclusive principle, which states that two parts cannot possess the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quant state", in which this "state" exists in the size and shape of some of their properties.
From this, the physicists share parts in two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are known as Fermione and who obey Pauli-principe.
And in the other, the bosons, a common band of anarchists, who are not holy - in any case, are not this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosones play on the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laborers (the rest is absolutely amazing) in two groups: the mesones that we are not treated here and the "force parts", by which the great forces of nature spread, and with which the Higgs-Boson would be connected anywhere.
But it has to be emphasized here that these bosones are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this Chronicles, then only thanks to a bison of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "bote" of the electromagnetic force.
If a part with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field will be "disrupted" in this place just like a steel stone which has been thrown into a piece.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosones "power bearers".
Stabilised Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs Field, must be "damaged" in order to show this Boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the controller must achieve very high energy, a little comparable to a frozen roof, whose surface could only be damaged by a very large stone.
That is why a huge part accelerator like the CERN is needed - the long Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all parts and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't -- for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator itself.
And likewise, do not interact with all parts with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (and the photon) do not have a mass.
What can all these research be "good" now, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to examine the standard model (SM), and they also enable the physicists to examine the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
There are also many physicists who hope that such differences will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes in the model.
It has to be said that there are still major weaknesses, since there is no explanation for the force (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups!).
However, such differences were not found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it does not exist.
Others: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the lost physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was discovered in the 1960s, and in 1962 he had developed the first life-threatening cluster (the first pulsed) - has already said that the laser was seen more than a "labor game" at the beginning.
Think about it...
In addition, applications can also be obtained from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle again developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eyes" and has brought it the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC are forced to change our lives, but it does mean that one can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... ▸ Le Devor
Quebec recently discussed the serious question of life with her Committee on Deaths in Ward.
The debate must be resumed in a short time, although a draft of legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devor tried to take this into account.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostatacreb had left him for a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've spent seven years," he said, half-year-old in his home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the morning.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting in front of the table before a delicious lunch, he wishes to be redesigned to help with food.
It helps him to laugh even and talk to the strangers who are working for him, bring his medications to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that one completes my experience, because this is misleading," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this habit.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man panics in the rock," says Pierre Brodour, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unhindered demolition for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person," he states, taking a step back.
Because in the eyes of several people working in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are placed in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer taken over by doctors and nurses who care about them, with so-called "skilling" care.
For Mrs A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by first arrest".
But because of the disease, I really knew my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want any more in life," she says, before she accepts that you set up a mask that helps you to breathe.
In the next days, however, she looks forward to the last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of voluntary body care and assistance when taking food.
The palliative care will be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants have a bed for palliative care.
It's very small when you consider that one day we're all going to die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the world.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You give the dying person a oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, if you want.
Diabetes no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will tear the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We help our members and patients at the same time," reports care director Nathalie Savard.
There's no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his bosses, while being attacked at his age, a 36-year-old man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children dies tragically after trying to survive.
"For six months three to five beds have always been in bed with cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients assigned to the Home Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that will reduce the suffering of patients if they have reached the end stage of their life, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the community for domestic palliative care in Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
That is precisely this great urgency in the Quebecs health care provision ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care take care of the adoption of a law on the provision of death assistance and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifest has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Laponite to prove their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebecs health system is not effective enough to ensure that all have the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting death assistance.
Before long, she said, I saw a patient who had 14 days of severe pain in the emergency without taking steps to alleviate it.
I was afraid that the patients wanted to die only because they did not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she broke down a terrible chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to break up the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I had stopped fighting, she told me.
But she had told me I was at the end!
Not a launchable item
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have prayed to die thanks to the care staff that this desire has not been replaced after their pain has been reduced by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be said clearly that palliative care in the treatment of pain is not unimpotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care company of the municipal palliative care unit of Montreal, 8% of patients do not talk about pain treatment.
Therefore, at the end of the whole life, doctors often return to the terminal settlement, which goes on to involve patients either sporadicly or continuously until the time of their death.
We can't do it any longer if we don't take this side of suffering.
Patients with no pain reduction will often have the opportunity to return to this terminal setting.
Patients who do not suffer their pain say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean "I want you to touch me," but "I want my pain to be healed."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate canals large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the street construction agency, construction companies, political parties' money brokers and specialists of the Italian Mafia are telling them every day what they know about a great "system", which is limited to the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and Mafioso.
A "industrial", which was very expensive for the tax collector Quebecs, particularly in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's remarkable how the system has fallen since you took drastic measures," said Jacques Duchesneau, coordinator of Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
The scandal was covered by an in-depth investigation of the investigations in relation to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only voluntarily approved.
The Duchessnew report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and recruitment of officials.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010, he stressed that "the Ministry of Transport alone would have paid a billion dollars to the contracts," because some had used their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to trial", he adds, hoping that it will "show the tactics behind the individual".
A 2011 life-long, permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which took place in 2011, also makes great efforts with its troops to investigate, detect and analyse the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Trupe", which has caused since 2009, that Montreal's "canalization card" is continuing with the artificial termination of the contracts...
In the past few weeks, she has carried out selective house searches and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal manpowers such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who was returned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of taking money back in exchange for public contracts.
The other engineers of Montreal's street building, as well as operators of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
Finally, the Commission has taken a view by explaining how the "system" works for public procurement.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a prosecutor associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gerald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand in his hand in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He was also able to organize an illegal media initiative for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Cancellation contracts that have been artificially incurred by him
In Montreal the "system" of corruption was free of charge.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as fixing money of $736.000, as opposed to cancellation contracts, which he artificially incurred.
Other officers of the road construction agency have indicated that they were smiling by putting up the calculations with false additional services artificially about 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately taking over a shadow budget that filled his pockets with black money.
As a result of these speculations, Mr Tremblay returned in early November, which destroyed Montreal in a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to strike the alarm.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the eastern part of the island, they argued against the sale of a community plot that they purchased $5 million and sold 1.6 million to farmers in the tree-based real estate market.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
The study, which is finalized, says that it "comes to a Father, which enables us to understand the functioning of the Athenian underground system to stop the practice and cause debt".
She says that the procedure is "skinned, but positive".
We, however, need only a specific detection unit for Montreal, as well as a monitoring to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchessneau notes, on the other hand, that "the officers stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but above all, think about the role of the "mandatory forces who are on the tactics in the picture" if they were not developed in the battle!
Out of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "I was told that this was just a weak discount of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit spending on parties to $100, which would therefore not change the situation: "Unless the election campaigns are strictly limited, black money will be in the political process."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by walking with courage, we can build the house on a solid basis with more control and legislation."
If this story damages the international view of Quebecs and those of Montreal, Mr Duchesneuu asks those who laugh about it to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal perspective, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I don't get excited.
Since my beginning in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clarefontaine until my time of play at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
So they use the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to exhibit games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is exclusive.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the stars and wants to give his best.
On the other hand, I have a lot about Carlo Ancelotti in my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti will ensure respect for all technicians.
In League 1 there is no comparable person at present, and he is among the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with seen associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just received from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also a statement for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us to the place of the captain.
But we're winning in the meantime.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the back end.
What is the objective of the Union in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak against very good European men.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto so that we can pull the back of the back end of the game as home game.
Can the PSG be a major European Union in a short term?
He's already got the budget for it...
In order to become a great European union, Paris has to win the title and make a name for a long time.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG has the means to adopt specific forms of this project.
Would it be a great mistake not to win the title in League 1 as this was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great surprise.
This year, we are really at heart to take this title off.
We were close in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We've finished the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
You should normally be with 79 points master...
But another man, those of Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the great men like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the witness to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us will be expected.
We accept it perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can't afford, that's frustrating with certainty.
You ask yourself what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every week with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A man builds himself up with time.
In the Champions League, we have demonstrated strength.
Consider Manchester City, a union that has not been established for two seasons to qualify for the eight-year final, and has also carried out huge expenditure!
In view of the invested sums, you believed in the game break with 15 points forward!
It seemed that our opponents and the French Mastership would be left out of control.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "brought up" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the laughing winner and tell us that we have won them in spite of all the difficulties.
The PSG seems completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To make it better to speak of a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many towers.
That's why he's here and he proves he's the star of League 1.
Around where he played, he has led his eyes to see that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the man we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has read is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French National Mission?
It's like a surprise.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some time playing.
I've seen things out there that I've been strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good games in the National Union.
This has been my baptism with the "Bleus" hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have taken our lessons and today we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players and is ready to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a game of adventure in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used it for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the participants.
Moreover, as often as in these technologies, a political vision is acceptable: the conviction that the current monetary system, created by banking monopoly, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollar, Euro, etc. convertible) and a protocol for the safe exchange like BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been identified.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a payment instrument.
After reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's course fell five months later to $2, before he received about $10 today (the courses are posted on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "as usual".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to appear in a video game that can be won or bought by games (and sometimes even exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is always controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network notes are simultaneously stored in the account book, examiners, cash issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
By contrast, the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymousity.
A number of data related to this transaction are signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can test the authenticity of the transaction.
It is also possible to ensure that the processed Bitcoins are available in the account book distributed across the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on computers, where the winner, who is a kind of transitional central banker, has the privilege of adding these additional lines.
It is about cutting the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number before it's "retracted".
The goal is to find those numbers that produce a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number has been found, the other nodes can no longer check if it is correct.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) in order to pay it twice, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unconnected as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this wage will be doubled regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in the range are therefore limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred million players can participate, which makes a certain game room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task will be increased with any improvement in the performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depth.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin plug-ins were stolen.
"The weakness used does not relate to the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced paymium, which is a company for the payment of real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, Bar money also reflects these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse to spend this kind of money.
They are accepted by others such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been replaced," joyful Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, converted Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this money, believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but it uses bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in the hands of dealers, and later no new terminals or computer programs need to be installed.
They simply have to specify a address that can be "photografted and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to be overcome by the Hierarchical systems in favour of stronger horizontally adjusted systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin passes, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends to reassess the various risks that are considered today as high in the event of the success of this money.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kaspisa and Surobie).
NATO and the US should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we have ourselves killed with our 88 soldiers, as well as the wounded and the traitors.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence as in the Soviet era.
They want to protect their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined Dschyhadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tadsks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local authorities, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discrepancy.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with mandel trees, financed with French credit, was properly achieved.
The truck and panzer convoys overflewed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flows of Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since its inconsistencies between 1994 and 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was taken over from the war because of the wars of the various rebel groups.
Its adoption was then considered a type of release and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the oscurity of farmers overrun by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mudshaeddin, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban have the common desire to hold women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have again come to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by challenging the government's principles to sell them as a Bauland to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American surrender of subcontracts.
They called themselves, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of gods.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could benefit from the American applications: capital flow is considerable.
The young people have set up war and their ideals.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the oscurity of the parties or to corruption of certain driving forces, will have to make jobs available.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represents a modern world, is being viewed everywhere.
An army is now present.
Are the authorities under which they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to rebuild the militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should benefit from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by withdrawing the office of the Prime Minister, which had been the Constitution since 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong presidency.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent for 50 years and has been dependent on foreign aid for a long time.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional vacuum cleaners do not exist and important water systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that has been subjected to war for 30 years, it would be necessary to control infrastructures.
The famine was spread to fill Afghanistan's immense land prices.
This also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only present in order to empower them.
Without energy to process the rail or passenger in front of the place, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mountain building is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, let the international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) in the huge Buddhist state make their tombstones and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was concluded on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and young people, French Institute for the University of France, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural field, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cic) established in 2012 has carried out numerous joint work and measures to cure agriculture in tens of thousands of mountain villages and to be carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "wine and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of the cohesion of aid and offensive actions.
These works, which were necessary for the numerous local labour forces, have helped to highlight the rise: water, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural use.
What Souvenir are we going to put back to military spending of two billion euros?
A much more detailed budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often very hard to deal with in this area of more than 2,000 metres.
Thousands of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa have been made.
In order for farmers to be freed from the rebellion led by foreign groups, according to their own statements, the continuation of their own would be less, better controlled and they would need direct civil aid for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Cross in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is concerned with the declaration of the Constitution, which gives it the unlimited power, more and more, because it remains broken, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would be adopted on the next day.
Just a week ago, the state capital had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt now has almost two years of support for a provisional, multi-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal transition.
This new initiative has only provided for a stronger column of the country.
For his opponent, the President in his "autocratic delirie", he continues to "sit his word" and "the right to walk with his feet".
On the part of his sponsor, it is ensured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that the brothers were forced to abandon their plans to explain the text section to the Egyptians for a section.
It is also a way for the Presidents to regain their public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is going on throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American Weekly Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
Once the people of Egypt are brought back to a unanimous vote, an ultimatum will be put on the people of Egypt: "You either agree on my proposal or I shall retain the unlimited power", the latter should probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a rare atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not met the requirement.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they withdrew because they felt that they were not able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to reach the decision-making capacity, in the morning 11 persons, represented by representatives, were added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the article was adopted unanimously.
On the other hand, the commentators found that the only difference of opinion of the day... has come to the point of prayer at the time, since some members of the Panel felt that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text that was adopted yesterday evening is made up of 234 articles.
Article 2, which focused all attention, remains identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of the Scharia are the main sources of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the creation of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For Muslims, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
The liberals, who consider this to be just a propaganda attack, are proud of being honest.
Because they follow the Islamicization of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in particular Article 220 in the eyes of the University of Al-Azhar which recognises an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the Scharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals are also confirmed by the fact that the next Rector of this university should be far less consistent than the present one.
"This time there is no concrete religious commitment to recognize.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulama, but academics who have been trained in the French system," laments Alexis Blueet, who writes a doctor's work on the Egyptian Constitution.
However, he argues that "that in relation to Article 220 there may be a majority, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious act.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic legal language, e.g. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised, whether civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the extensive powers he gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wish, the audit of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence board.
There will also be no ban on civilian procedures in military corrections, as the Unions have called for to protect human rights.
The latter shall also share their fears with respect to the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The actual file of the explosives will be maintained, and prosecutions are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression of opinion, in particular for the press.
In addition, there is no article on the protection of women, subsisting Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to go outside the television last night, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
The sponsors of the state capital will be marked on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy cities, the world's Nabel and a sea from the sun
The promised land combines the majesty of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unsurpassed nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Precisely before the Holy City
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who pray in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galillaa is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the turning of water into wine on a wedding feast, the going on water, the watering of the sea and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the holy rooms, however, are located in Jerusalem.
Believers here seek the path of suffering or the cross of Jesus Christ (from Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the graveyard on the mountain Golgotha, where the cross station, the salvation stone and the grave of Jesus is located.
Here is a Christian view of the nebel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is in the place where a Christian legend was born following the tree from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complainants, the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people from different religious backgrounds leave tents with desires that then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the altitude
The ruins of Massada's fortress form the remains of the secret hidden hiding before enemies, which allowed Herod the Great to be built in 25 C.E. for his family.
They are located on a felswand in the mountains at 450 metres above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins with their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, from 1600 to 2040 meters high is the famous ski area of Hermon, where it is inhabited by numerous tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there with a shuttle bus.
The shipyards have a total length of 45 kilometers.
An ancient legend that followed apparently pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
In just one trip, not all of it can be visited.
However, at least the five most interested parties should be allowed a visit.
One of these is the Israel Museum near the Knessset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or inscriptions from the dead sea found in caverns in the Jewish deserts, as well as some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of the printer and expressives coins, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be presented.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several souls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathrooms.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Rally Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souven airfields.
The income is free, and donations are generally paid off.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, is one of the most exciting chapters of history.
The most impressive section is the memory for the children who were built to remember the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
In the presence of the space, complete darkness prevails.
The star's working.
The names of the Jews and the people in which they died are known.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three most important recovery areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, Delfinaria and Oceania in each of the three places.
The water temperature does not fall below 21°C and the air is warm up to 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and will be there for the whole year.
On the other hand, this unusual sea with a position of 417 metres below the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore does not even carry any cooler freely on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using saltswater (natural salts) and sanitation as well as for the treatment of skin disorders, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and despaired nerves.
The secrets of old age are affected
These secrets are located in the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaports, the Egyptians, Syria, Anatolias, and Mesopotamia enjoyed a close relationship with one another.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and algae legends.
As a result, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life here.
Tourists like to speed up through the narrow gases that are named after star signs.
Fortuna should be the legend for all who touch the walls in the gas with their signs.
In Jaffa, you can contact new pairs from all over Israel and even other countries at photo terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can cross through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crucifix.
In Roman times Caesar was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman emperor, including Pontius Pilate.
Tonight evening concerts and operas are held in the carefully restored theater.
List of brands for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of the Israelites speak Russian.
The money in the trip is taken in no euro, but in dollars that can be exchanged easily (current exchange rate: $1 to 3.8).
In the city you usually get ahead with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast route and in Haifa the only U-road line of the country with six stations that connect the town to the Upper City.
Just taken, it's a underground railway.
A journey within the city costs 6 bicycles regardless of the means of transport, which is quite inclusive for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be celebrated in Israel.
From Friday to Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is running.
And in the morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only more expensive food is served, excluding meat, sea products, fish without shoes and food, which includes milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammock and beef, soup and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, frittered balsams from dried beans and vegetables (flavolf), as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no exciting dogs.
For this, there are many well-wrought cats, which run smoothly and unfavourable through the streets.
In the evening you see it even sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like live places and don't say no to cure.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance also costs 15 dollars a day.
And driving rental costs 15 cycles per day.
The entrance cards for museums cost 30 pieces in the middle.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over Israel visited.
Most adventurers and recovery seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, corresponding to an increase of 51% in 2010 compared to the comparison period, prior to the abolition of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While discussing the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with bad certificates
Each year 13 million guests arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families that remain in the home.
On 1 December, a law is in force that every migrant must follow a test that demonstrates the knowledge of Russian language.
To date, this provision applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, tests should be carried out in time according to the Federal Migration Authority for all guest workers in the future.
This requires not only language tests but also tests in Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated for both the acquisition and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the fall of the UdSSR in 1991.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
The whole of the audit stations will be under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can enable tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Council and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press several times asked: What does it really bring?
What changes do we need to make in the provision of language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, contrary speakers of the Migration Authority are going to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the Head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tadskistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Migrants are faced with problems without employment, education, language skills and medical attention.
Sebelow is convinced that a future migrant without language will encounter people with bad intentions who, under the help of help, put him in a dark, narrow barack, where he will spend thousands of his months without food and documents and spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised one, and when you arrive, you will receive their passports and will not receive the promised reward," confirmed the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Turkish Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't move, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who want to earn their money in Russia are not only able to control the language of the country but also unable to express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not as much their debt as the usual: only a few Turkmen, Uzbek and Tadschiken can also provide a reasonable basic education.
For there is not even money in their families to feed the children, but it is weak to buy them appropriate clothing, shoes and shoes.
As teenagers, these children also gain the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's hard without language," they say.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' law stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must start the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no verification and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, the majority of guest workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Wonderly welcome" or "Breathing for Unauthorized Persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hearts and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A broken registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police staff know that our documents are most popular and that we are not registered, and then there are cases of repression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just don't make any expense for false paper"
Already on the day on which the law was in force, it appeared that the registration documents of migrants could not only be counterfeit.
A number of fake certificates that demonstrate the completion of the language test have already been decided by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified paper was printed with a common color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this otherwise: any migrants who hoped that the tests could be saved would pay for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
In addition, the most urgent task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and citizens are certain.
For the moment, guests who are first hit by the test can only promise that they will receive time for a language course.
In addition, new generations without language skills are offered in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of Interior Ignores the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in criminal matters is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Interior is planning a violation of the gun law for private owners.
To this end, the authorities react to the most recent events: wounded by beatings on weddings and seven deaths in the massacre of the Moscow jurist Dmitri Winograde.
The police are trying to ban the possession of non-duty weapons in the public and the age for the possession of weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the President of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the gun law will be submitted in the short term.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "shulling up".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - were asked by the authorities to take away the "unconstitutional abuses" away.
The percentage of offences with registered weapons is very low, except for the criminal lawyer, Vasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 offences involving the use of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 were recorded for the same period total of 1,168 thousand Delicte.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a violation of the law on the private possession of arms would not cease to serve on the black market.
Currently, you can find any weapon you can use in Moscow for a small amount of money.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the offices
The weapons reached through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, told by former Prime Minister Viktor Baranez, who has been active for ten years in the Ministry of Education and at the General level.
Screenshot of a web page that takes up the arms command
The first canal is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the war in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel, illegal weapons will be stolen from criminal orders.
Baranez explains that there are weapons that have been stolen from both the police and directly from the prosecution authorities.
Other illegal arms sold are from military arsenals.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that, in some cases, there was a fire-fighting process to replace the lack of weapons," said the former military officer.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today there are countless private mining factories that do not maintain international competition, and therefore the weapons under hand on the black market, about in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the Schmuggel.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a private, sometimes hand-made production and a mafia that organizes the smuggel," explains the former military officer.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Crimeological Literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
The overwhelming part of the illegal weapon is caused by the military and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are there through the "debt of the responsible ones who have been involved in their work with weapons," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons from conflict areas were fired, 14% were returned to the fuel stations in the production of weapons, and 5% were from illegal mining.
A arms dealer who does not want to be named, ensures that weapons found at illegal dignitaries no longer buy any more because they are old.
As a result, it is more common for dealers to take care of the nest in a gunstore.
A weapon, for example a gun of the TT type, is purchased over a knife.
The weapon will be released and handed over by the Zaun.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if they can't contain the crime detection plan, regularly buy control at dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers usually find each other famous.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I get to Begowaja station, where a person would wait for me who would bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I'm going to get there first
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To take care of a gun, I need a person who has contacts," says the seller. "I have such a person, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there's a need to get in there and break up with a code like "Iwan Ivanowitsch, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I'm even going to some damages about a person I trust.
He's also giving me the wounds just because he knows I don't hurt him.
Newlings are looking for weapons on different roads.
In the mid-1990s, former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schematics have not changed.
He got a photo album in which he was described as "all possible".
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," recalls the military officer.
The buyer does not get the cat in the bag according to Baranez, but can try everything.
I buy not only as a potential customer but also go with the seller in the forest, and we set up a target ship there.
"I can shoot there then, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the move.
Purchases from Sofa
Internet search engines show search results for web pages and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There will be no need for any paper or personal meetings.
"They only need the appropriate sum of money," it says in the advertising release on the website "Buy guns or guns".
There give users your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license", asks the user "Iwan".
"Course a TT. Moskau", asks the Laconian question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently turned countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are going to the service rather to the network.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then countries in Siberia and can smell coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible shall take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a bank account.
"As an answer, he gets a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the community-owned organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can also go out empty and come behind guitars if you place a question on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are going to the service rather to the network.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labour camp and can cook coal," he says.
A macrow for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal weapons, experts are therefore able to calculate prices of 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun from the type Makarow for $100 to 300.
You have to wait until one half months.
The weapons will be issued in military arsenals by observers in the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of dealers with illegal weapons throughout Russia from January to October 2011 was 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and repression in relation to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives declined by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket employees
Every fourth US-American youth once sits behind McDonald's box
In the past days there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Free Chicken.
Still no one can predict whether the protests will be further shaken or if the air will soon be gone again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-hand community organisations.
In addition to increasing the paid wages of simple Walmart and Fast-Food employees, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised commercially.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after thanking, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, the millions of customers were arrested, which led to both trades.
On that day, some Walmart workers, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their jobs and extended their work with cooperatives and left-wing active branches of the chain, whose target group is low and middle-income.
Walmart sells all the products, from winds over hunting and car batteries to steam cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart vials is averaged between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the less paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics follow Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheap because the employees are paid badly.
Finally, they also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing gables or hand scanners.
The participants in the protest requested salary increases on Black Friday and expressed their concern that the contribution to the business-owned health insurance of 30 to 100 dollars per month was increased.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at the California University in Berkeley say that if the company increased the average wage by 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're paying for now.
If Walmart would fully pay the loans to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cent more in the future.
This would be just $12.39 per year for them compared to today's monthly expenditure.
In fact, supporters of Walmart are satisfied that only nine federal states have come to protest and these have not protected the company from any loss.
The Black Friday stayed in his shop from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart casinos carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, in an interview on the left-hand side of Huffington Post, claimed that overall "less than five" Walmart employees were downgrading the work and the protest was merely "a further PR-trick" of the company that organized the protests.
"Free Case!"
The protests continued this week in New York where, however, their goal was not Walmart-Filiens (those who did not want to be present in this progressive city) but were McDonald's and other prestigious restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, yet you're not going to get sick, and you're not going to pay for your honest work!
Jumanee Williams, member of the New York City Treaty
The minimum wage is currently at 7.25 dollars per hour according to federal and New York law.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage will be increased and increased, but not too strong, and in average, their simple staff in New York $8.90 will receive an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to spend so little money in New York is unacceptable to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American teens were in school after McDonald's school, but young people still lived with their parents.
Almost one saw the main source of income or plants, to stay there longer.
Now I meet with staff members from McDonald's constant people who complain that they will come out with this reward and sometimes have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum that the author notes that it is irresponsible to get children if you don't know how to eat them.
The protestors, who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday morning before McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that the cashier and cook of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars per hour, which is more than a double of today's minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the conduct of companies to pursue this objective and remove or release trade union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is high staff flow.
Satisfied
There were loud protests this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The main point of the protest was a meeting on Wednesday before McDonald's at Times Square, in which some local Democrats, including mayor Jumane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the Mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together so that they can receive a fair reward and achieve the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action in the history of the US-American fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people in the area who were not all employed in the fast-food industry working in New York tens of thousands of people.
It is still not to be seen whether the functions of these protests will be mobilized to a total extent.
"The brain is only able to go through a lot"
The theme of extended reality, which was popular in modern technologies, is recently adopted by the lens of a special brightness.
First, Google presented a functional model at its annual conference in summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a suitable patent.
However, in the discussion with the leader of the 3D interactive technology group in Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it will be clear that the brightness for the scientists of the company was only a transitional station.
It allows you to manipulate virtual objects in the air with just hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is conducting.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, but they want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has remained largely trapped in the phase, where it is worked with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also affected.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and kinect sensors are making progress, and today no Xbox is sold without kinect because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play off on the screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue was still not decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional performance systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical world and make it more fascinating.
However, it is necessary not only for the user but also for its environment to be recognized.
Then we could achieve the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should be rid of these vulnerable virtual reality sources!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but won't she be overrated?
- It is certainly not the whole solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to know all the circumstances about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but everyone in their particular nodes is good.
For example, we worked in the control of objects in public places on a project where we experimented with short and short gestures instead.
The breaths were not recorded by the object camera, but by a band that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, however, theoretically could be reduced to the size of an arm's length.
But in general, the future, however, consists of mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How is that?
- Would you like me to give you this sprudel dose, for example?
They say it and say it at the same time.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Is that what you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at any time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time, we need to work on developing new types of sensors, which will allow us to take a closer look at people's reactions.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, as they offer a good solution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it impossible to solve, deep or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of tridimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main issues are not the Megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
This is how all the current technologies are not good enough for us because the developers of algorithms have more work to do.
It must be taken into account not only the solution for X and Y, but also for Z axis.
Also the speed and number of images per second are important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too small for breath.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our lab in Redmond with a regular processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, where today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work, I needed such an arrangement, only without reference and with more images per second.
- Didn't the number of cameras have to be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflective signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the object weight.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with various camera connections to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember right, Microsoft presented his glasses instead of Google to the public.
Don't you think that in view of the application of technology of increased reality every day, the mirror has the best views?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the given hand, but I think the best variant would be a "changeable" extended reality where we could turn over a cloud from the mirror to the smartphone,
The brightness is a personal Gadget and lies in it its strength (privats you can only see), but at the same time also its weakness, because an extended reality prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's assume for a long time that the manipulation of virtual Holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: There is no emotional reaction!
The hands don't smell anything at all!
What answers do you want to give your group on this occasion?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the increased reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between humans and machines.
I think it could be through the integration of tactical perceptions.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual design documentation.
She's doing a great job of printing!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something handy, for example, create the interference of some wired ultrasounds in a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that the moment is still as weak as someone pushed over the wrists.
There are also bands for the hand chain that affect the nerves in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to cross the brain?
Do you think that's what it's supposed to smell when it's just seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed space, believing that he is instead in an open, practically infinity space; here we work on concepts of running bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only able to pass through moderately, and there are still many busy years before us.
This is what makes the work on the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: in many subjects, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to the city's inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the list read, countries have already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success goes beyond the city's borders and is often recognised in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, who is dressed in red, once at the Russian Museum, once at the summer garden, sometimes at stage events or on Vernissagen.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are also displayed, they attract large crowds of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophic artists who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80th or the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city, and, by his presence on the street, he enthralled his people with a smile in his face and gives them a good place.
Before long, he became a triangular and became a Petersburg-Dreorgel player, as he felt ready for this difficult role in view of his artist's drawing, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in Rot and not, for example, in Gelb or Turkey in the city?
I have chosen the red color as a fashion designer that compares with the optic and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, artists and society.
In society, everything is called for something different from the Graunorm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get in touch with people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to speak.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my work was performed.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old was free, but not officially recognized painters at the time, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewskina", from which there was "Pushkinskaja 10", and then it was the first time.
I'm attracted to the theatre, the fashion, the music, in fact, all except literature.
And all of this unites in your art clinic... and it was important for me to be at the center of Petersburg culture where the best artists should gather.
In 1995, I owned a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a music and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schneur and his friends sing simple songs to play back, wear tight tricks and belong to them, also belonged to today’s said composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it was from her Leningrad.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he taught us the basics.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also has its origin in the art clinic.
Therein went our staff and our family guests.
I'm a hero of the past century, as culture still means something.
In the year 2000, there was a question in the press where it went about the designation "Privacy of Our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and I was reached at the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unknown style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make the reality and strength of the thoughts to express.
I'll have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be so.
In a clown, it's all out there and it's losing its tragedy.
I love the Greats, and I have great ideas.
For example, we save the world by predicting that everyone has to dress perfectly.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should put him in his face.
The sweat disappears by clothing.
We'll see you in the role of the city's three-year-old player.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice, too?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and smooth.
We see the fall of cultures.
In the past, people formed big groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-Communitys, and it's hard to get everyone down.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to guess who you're going to fall.
Now each cultstar has about 100 fans.
- But thousands of people are coming to St. Michael's event!
- He's got left-handed women, there's the sex-social sphere playing a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is going to be based.
I have attachments, and the most important thing is not to corrupt them and not destroy the heritage.
In my youth, I have painted such images that even in a collection of works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, that's something else.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and saved money to paint.
That's the culture I admired.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
It is said: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
At the real fairs, it was different because the fairs may not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are needed.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have what experts might be, but they are being blocked by the way, as there is a need for higher experts who evaluate the first ones correctly and free them from the path.
Now it's just your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable neighborhood.
On our stones art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural neighbourhood, for example, because we have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be again modern, just as at the beginning of the first century.
The project is financed from the projects of the city of Sankt Petersburg
Born in the World
Earth in danger.
Earthquake or combination with Killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with land dwellers on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question is how can we continue to thrive in gravity or on the planet?
I don't think there are many options.
The fact is that there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"Naturally Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomic Starnberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on March are comparable to life-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails over the surface of Venus.
Life would be only at large or in the walkway of Venus, so in all, possible.
The question of continuing farming in all was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the Flora.
Already half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the seed born in the Orbit does not differ in the least of the irradial species.
It followed the breeding of insects, exactly of winch fruit birds (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979 waiteiers were sent to the world to investigate how the severity of embryo development is affected.
It develops a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen must be stopped; it must stand on its legs and begin to move," explains the director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Searchew.
Without a fixed base, the kitchens are overrun wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of newborns disappeared completely.
The kitchens didn't react to light and sound.
Four days later, they just die.
"Two times we let kitchens fall apart and then put the whole together, because it's easy to work there with them," says Vladimir Searchew.
The last bite with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In spring 2013, experiments were continued.
However, only gender species will be found on the Biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been sent to All.
In principle, no specific action was taken.
"It was just with the biosatellite, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research had to be continued," observes Vladimir Searchew.
After the landing, the world-wide rates of growth grew.
The problems of continuing cultivation could not be solved directly in the world.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken from their natural habitat cannot simply follow their breeding route.
Unlike animals, humans could have the principle.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
However, women have been flying all over 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereschkova.
The most valuable thing that mankind has is female organization.
Our mothers fled from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it understand the global flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says spacefartveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her worldwide flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkova, became a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in All, Swetlana Savizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, became a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy.
"The more dangerous it is even when flying in the orbit," concluded Cosmonaut Valerie Poljakov, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
But mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboration in the Kosmonauten Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here the cosmonaut routines of work in the open space are found in a Swiss state.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adult water feels pleasant, it is a strange environment; however, freshwaters feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ithinger would bear witness that life in the country has risen to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb for about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the spring water and that it can then become easier to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical that from birth to the first swimming, just once 2 weeks will pass.
"It's too little time to forget something," says Babieswimmler Marina Aksenowa.
While pregnancy is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not come out without force.
In the state of severity, the bow and back muscles come back very quickly and the ability to push out the child also depends on the ability to express himself.
All right, let's go around this through breast-feeding.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special room to force the child out.
"But what happens then?" asks the insignificant question of Waller Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial force.
Without feeling the earth's formation, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child can not be placed in an adult’s womb as a child for training in a burden.
He will simply lack what is essential for his life.
"This experiment, which we take together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring into the world an obstacle to bringing a completely inadequate human being," said the director of the Institute's Bioethics Committee for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
To date, the birth of children in the world is only theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the inhabitants of the earth in their spaceships climb to a distant planet that will come home for their all-born offspring.
NKU Head: Black System Control Fails by Debt Policy · Global Voices
Chechnya has access to public contracts for good control bodies and adequate legislation, but applies it again.
Im Gesprech für Aktualná.cz says der Vizepresid des Höchsten Controllamtes (High Control Authority, NKÜ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly - and this is not the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a common control by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative example of practice, he led the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečás to the same point. "Black system".
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not deal with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must, however, have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the control board, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, is to prevent its activities," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Board of Auditors, you will talk about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with public procurement.
Why was that so specific?
This is a parallel test with which we started about two years ago.
Simply stated, it is because the European legislation sets out how public contracts are to be maintained, which builds on the national legislation, and, finally, the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we were able to identify very interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even more "stronger and more perfect", but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
In order to prove that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules, one must also deal with the actual application of the law.
In what way can the project be a help to you? What comes to you from this project?
Such a common control could only help us to stop trying to achieve the perfection of the laws and to reduce and eliminate thresholds if this appears not to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means to acquire a matter at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unfair approaches or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
It may even be that we are burdening the system in this way only with excessive "paper frame" and those who are looking for gaps in the system, it is much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remain higher.
They discuss the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here like our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant to the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college that is only a little different, but in principle both authorities work the same.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, in which Germany is a state of Germany, i.e. that there are also these accounting heads in the individual German countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal resources, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the regions and communities are under the control of the Heads of State.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would only compare this without specific details. However, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Is it possible that the inspectors are better there?
This is not determined, but as it has been said: such comparisons I do not particularly like.
It is also important to note that those countries that are a precedent for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they had nothing to do with cooperation with our authority, didn't they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, how important it was for your authority to renew the grant law, do you already have any effects?
In view of the fact that these clouds are in force only for a short time, they are not yet active in our tests.
Since our controls take place at night, we have to calculate here with a certain delay.
We are increasingly concerned about the effects of future controls in the preparation phase - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks to the economy" and examined and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will be made naturally, since the threshold values, which have changed the conditions for certain types of expressions, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or will the system be taxed with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules will be "stronger" and will no longer be maintained.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the carrier (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable for the fact that any non-compliance with the legislation on a budget loss is equivalent.
Is it worthwhile, then, to make the law more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not those who have committed a form error that does not affect the real decision finding.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First, let's say which way is not objective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS did not control the company. "Black system" would be respected - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system currently banned or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it is not possible for the President of the Government to come and the control board, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, to prevent its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say that we do so if nothing is done.
The procurement legislation contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures - and that is also appropriate for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the supplier with the best offer is excluded only because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what we lack in my view.
On the streets, however, they are too dry.
On the streets of Chechnya there is partly snow and ice cream.
However, the roads are very well accessible, while increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In Karlsbad district, the streets were well accessible this morning, singlely decorated snow and ice cream.
The temperatures fall at -5 to -10 °C, which should be slightly warmer every day.
In the region it is no longer shrinking, and in the deep mountains there is only a thin snowfall.
However, there are about 30 cm snow on the slopes of the mountains.
According to the regional road watch, Nebel’s limited view was overcome.
The R6 fast road and the transport routes of the first class of road in the region are currently unlimited.
However, attention has been paid, for example, to bridges where the railways are required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are accessible.
However, on these roads, cuts are either required or excluded.
In particular in the higher levels, therefore, increased attention has been paid.
Areas Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some Eastern roads there is a danger of ice-creaming, higher levels, and in the mountains there is still a snowboard on the streets, sharing the road and road directions on their internet pages.
The road teachers warn passengers against ice creams, which can occur in particular in higher levels in the Pardubice region.
It can be found on the roads of the second and third road classes in the districts Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitaviy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially situated on the streets in the Rieginggen mountains and in the Orlické mountain mountain.
An exhilarated snowship lies on the streets of Rychnov nad Knžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern forests today it is too sunny or hotter, and it remains largely free of decay.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Regional Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen area are well accessible today, but local attention has been paid, and the road has been adapted to the weather.
This is fresh in the morning, with temperatures ranging from 3 to 9 °C.
Since it has been cut before and the temperatures fall accordingly, it can reach ice cream on the streets.
It is also interesting to think of Nebel, however, where the view will be improved in the course of the day.
These data are derived from the district street teachers.
The D5 highway is practically unlimited, but increased attention is recommended by the road teachers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The roads of the first class are too dry, but they are frozen.
However, in the south of the circle of Pilsen and Tachov it can reach ice cream.
The roads of the second and third class of road are tight, and therefore the reference here applies to possible sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful on less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Bezirk Olomouc
With Schneematsch today, drivers who are on their way to the mountains in the Olomouc district need to be trained.
After the use of electric vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sitlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
During the night, the road masteries are forced to use, in the vicinity of Shumperk, according to data from the road administration about 3 cm Neuschnee.
In the other areas of the region, the roads are usually freely accessible.
"In the circle of shumperk remain in the upper layers or cutest.
On the pass of Červenohorské sedilo, the driver has to work towards Jeseník with Schneematsch," said a staff member of the Šumperk Road Administration today against the ČTK Agency.
Her colleagues in Jeseník's circle also had to get out at night, according to their comments, the streets are free and naked until they are in the high stations after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle the streets are unlimited, but in the Sternberg district, the drivers need to drive carefully in parts of the forest, since the roads are still warm here.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In northern areas, road teachers report the same number of bad traffic sections.
In addition to several locations with snow or ice sheet, the mountain street of Telnice to Knínce is closed in circle Ústí n.K. according to the information of the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in deep places below zero, so snow and ice will be kept on the streets. From the depths, especially south-east of the Böhmi mountains, there are no problems reported, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported until then.
Eisglatte is reported in particular from the area of Štítí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions in the night - daily rain and smelting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and the I/13 road along the border of the Ústí n.L. and Liberec areas have reported bad traffic conditions.
The crossing of the road between Telnice and Knínce was necessary because of the passions that were pressed from the snowcast to the railway.
Shimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is to take place in less than a month of the world's transition?
That's one of those disasters that we'd like to call people so much.
With our band The Tap tap, we are more curious about the band of the world and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to maintain or prevent the world's transition.
In December you will also carry out a unique project with three concerts against the global transition.
Can you introduce the project closer to our readers?
It's a country-wide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concert should be about the time on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a period of 12 hours before us, the Maya calendar ends.
Who is this idea from?
Initially, I think we have developed the idea together with our graphicer Honza Augusta.
We want to collect not only enough positive energy to prevent the world's transition, but also to think with the public about the condition in which we once gave this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keys against the world's passage, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The tape The Tap Tap has also included other interpreters as well. Hymne against the world transition with the title "World transition is falling out".
Today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Are they also available at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, it is expected that everything will collapse and the end of the world will not occur...
The Hymne should be sung at the same time by all interpreters at all three concerts.
In addition, the Hymns will be transferred live together in a direct turn of the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to work with both of you?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many beneficial events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most people are interested in our cooperation and have enjoyed it.
What purpose comes to the release of the concerts against the world transition?
For the establishment of the Barrier-Free Education Centre, where we have been working together for six years with the Joint Tap at Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to search the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building should be built in which we then join this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters appear.
What criteria have you examined?
We wanted to bring together a program that includes all generations.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratrapore with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
More information is available on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we will meet for the first time at Prague Spring, and for this concert we will also prepare an interesting program with interested guests.
The next year, we would also like to take part in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to link it with events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small until you are in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at the first look.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs need to be transported in the backroom. Besides, we need to share a lot of instruments and other packages...
However, it has always suffered without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes been somewhat surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of how it looks in individual countries with barbaric freedom, how it interacts with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnesses to the fact that in the east everything is still in its beginnings.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is certainly not an obstacle. It is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is alone in the city center.
It is not even understandable there, for example, that a wheelchair driver is being pushed up.
Fortunately, there are also groups that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to stop against the developing countries?
There's still a lot of things we're going to hang back...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move themselves in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just common that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap to the west!
Respect for public and barbaric freedom is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawmakers come out of our ranks, things will really start to change.
Until then, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years, what has motivated you in 1998 to build a band?
At that time, I became an executive at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and, like Saxofon, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, it's like our moderator, Ládáa Angelovič, to say, said something other than control (laugh).
But was the band known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we have helped to cooperate with famous singers; we have also begun to play actively for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and are not to see it outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can deliver good lecturers, high-quality equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I've learned the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the business today, one of the others is often copied.
This is logical in its way, since all new things are carefully considered and accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I'm careful to claim that Tap Tap is part of it.
The first impression the visitor has most is of course compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely excessive because people with disabilities are not united and left to repent.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities get something done, this is not just a step for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a stricter boss, how do you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also ask for a certain discipline.
But this is completely normal in my opinion.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice the week samples, they have to complete preparatory steps and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm is eased at many.
But it works everywhere, in every band that works hard and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty-two members.
How many of these were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Ládža Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and the pleasure of co-maching is always willing to come to us.
Finds place on the day before the predicted global change, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Event types are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three types of event will be linked to each other at the end of the live switch and it explains a common interpretation of the Hymne "World transition falls out" of the band The Tap Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled educational centre to be established in Prague under the name STUDEO at the Jedlićka Institute. Cost: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, maps are available in stock at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world room.
Last week, Poland was elected to a ministerial meeting of the members of the ESA as the twentieth member of this world authority. Poland is therefore the second member of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The Polish route to the world room began freely much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish cosmologists had been working on the space race, so they did not always gain understanding.
I recall, for example, the speech by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented his thoughts from his pioneer work "Intend to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience cold, and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Starnfeld won the prize REF Hirsch created by Robert Esnaul-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important founder of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadosski's widely recognized contribution to the development of the space cycle was confirmed by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the rising side of the moon.
Already in 1925, a railway tricycle was built in Poland for which a rocket operation was planned.
The author of the project and the details of this project are unfortunately unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rockets should be used to start or brake the drawings.
The information on this is only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczislaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokzyckiegi.
It is evident from the documents delivered that research has been proposed until the stage of practical testing.
The research was then freely interrupted by the entry into force of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the professional press of Ing. Rohozinski developed the design of a photoelectric jackdraket, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powitrnna i rakietbombamba lotnicza" of the author Lelya-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects were covered by the military use of the rocket industry.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the previous Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for a space travel company.
At the time, there was already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the research of the world's future would be.
At its beginning in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA has already sought to contribute to the 1951 International Federation for Space Traffic, and in fact the PTA has already become a regular member in autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed president of the International Federation for Space Transport.
He had been in this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of extremely successful meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum plane height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and was not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and began in 1959 in the Blüdów-West Airttest with the two-tub-tweet RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to deliver real scientific work - the RM-34 rockets should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was introduced.
Following the first rockets of the RM type, the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-phase rocket, its total length was 510 cm, and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of these rockets were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude is 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, whose first flights began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a 10 kg load of useful to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland's contribution to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in the interkosmos programme with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Act on Non-Discrimination of Work is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court adopted the law on non-profit works.
This decision was a lively debate in public.
It is of particular interest to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are united in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital that goes hand in hand with endless financial speculation.
Because of the great difference in the value of work (loans) it comes to price tensions.
In this respect, it is necessary to understand a condition in which the manufacturer tries to establish, by importing cheap goods into economic competition, competition "undersupplys" to increase a larger market share and increase its profits.
This means, to a large extent, that is for most companies to place their production abroad or buy them cheaply or to sell their business there. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and therefore does not bear responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, the State expenditure should be increased accordingly.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics at this point are excessive.
A situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce the social level of their own people artificially and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own people without regard for the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to the laws in force.
The aim of these measures is to force the people themselves to accept the dictatorship of private capital, in particular in the field of wages.
This is due to economic pressure on long-term unemployment, to others by breaking workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there has been a few years of public food supplies for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases in which workers have to pay such a low wage that the state has to suspend their income to the minimum of existence.
A similar scandal was also detected in the case of aid forces employed in Germany.
The savings measures of all EU countries will undoubtedly go beyond the same situation in which people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic breakdown of their social levels (as it was in the 19th century), or to work for a famine on the side of society, hoping that there will be some private investment capital flowing into the country.
The question is, of course, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, it is only the poverty of one country to another; or the capital remains quite the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, and in Africa, employees work at all.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media have argued that the state cannot share capital with its own economy, and that the economy is leading to economic disaster.
The private capital needs to be strictly based on its position that the State must not enter the economy slowly.
However, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence politics and thus affect the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and modern lobby in all the states.
The result is a double situation in the area of corruption, the mutual advantage, a legislative provision, in virtually everything effort, but it is not criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry does not have private funds, close legal entities which are involved in the development of legal bases with the industry.
These legislative proposals shall be adopted on the day of the Federal Republic of Germany.
All violence, then, is not from the people, as it proclaims the Western constitutions, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal democracies were quickly in a situation, as they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesars and Pompeys: "The state had been understood for a long time by chance, and the embassies were subjected to violence.
Anti-smoker money, by illegal comparison of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew relentlessly, and the people went with the votes already bought for election" ... "People with a character do not stand for agents, so the state had no consular for eight months due to this decline" ... "I have already started to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a single sovereignty, and that a strong man must be chosen"...
As it turns out, today's society is based, as well as in the Antique, on the unprecedented preference of its own advantage, without taking into account the interests of society as a whole.
The private capital is no longer capable of recognizing and implementing the benefit of the whole society.
The result, as at the time of today, is an unprecedented decade of elites who do not strive to reform deeply.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the unprecedented liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state of affairs, the transition of this regime can be seen as a certain break in favour of liberal democracies, where the next round is already mentioned.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today’s elites are completely unaware of the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from past and new history.
The repeal of the Act on Joint Action is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czechs will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore required by the system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the State's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopolization of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or could ever occur" sang Sting in song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain: "...that we may not forget how sinful we are."
"If my son didn't want war, don't give it," says the dying Goodel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were as always a number of reactions.
The one behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is in this constantly repeated wave of the death of the debtor and who is the victim; in the end, the modern inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It is therefore important for me to open the eyes of the readers behind the cults, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (as calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are especially useful in the small country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on the historical facts available, others are driven by these and are driven by my own understanding of who or what group of people influence the events of modern history to a certain extent.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle against power.
In any era, we can make Alexander the great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether someone behind her throne who tied their actions to a particular goal.
We must realize that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and its superior power has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that can be called the head of the cancer (I don't know whether anyone else is around them, but I don't get it out) - the Rothschilds.
A lot won't be written about her.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) has been purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to connect their name with high-crime acts, in which they always restrict their power, increase their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not participating in the central banks, they have fought or fought against them (before the crash in Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the fall in Iraq, there were only 5 countries following the storm of Ghaddafis, where Russia was undermining its central bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Anyone who has always tried to resist this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, released his own (saying: state) bank notes and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own bank notes and wanted the FED to be released - he was murdered in 1963; Commissioner Louis McFadden was convicted in 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED of the global economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan for the decommissioning of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freeman of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchy state of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number of such would provide for their conveniences and luxury and not use as much resources), create a universal religion (the eco-ism is no more than the precedent) and ultimately lead to the taking of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the resolution of a crisis and the next offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the Chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the FED so that crises like they were resolved in 1907).
After they had been defeated by the murder at the Habsburger Thornelder Ferdinand in Sarajevo to release the first world war, they destroyed the Russian kingdom by the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitalisation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian kingdom), followed by the resolution of the Central European Empire of Austria.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the Bankers, through politics, created a late conflict by putting Germany to war with giant war-reparations; thus, they were able to prevent the condition of the underprivileged masses, so that they had to defeat only a strong leader who called the accused and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the Czech people's state with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column, and also take action to prevent the fire of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Roths children began the creation of the Zionist movement, in which a second attempt was made to establish a Jewish state, possibly in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The previously mentioned Balfour declaration created the condition for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it was first met with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether Hitler was now out of the chain where international banks had initially held him, or if everything was loved according to the plan, it is only hard to estimate that the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war-reparations against Germany for the Second World War, the state's call for the establishment of the third world war fuel point.
When the international banks succeed in eliminating this war, the Jewish people will be like the second world war to sacrifice in the first battle, this time with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (to think only of how the people in attachment and opposition to Israel were divided).
Who is the blamer and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only results in an endless spiral of violence, where at the beginning the self-sustainment and their efforts are based on global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international banks in Israel as well as with us, the people, except their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-like, loyal international bankers who are doing all they can to start a war with Iran that could, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly expand into a global conflict, and in which Iran's control of only 2 miles across the broad streets of Hormus, with 20% of the world's oil supply, could lead to a global economy destruction.
In what light are the words of David Rockefellers of 1994: "The only thing we need is an exciting crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In her presentation, the new world order is a world of Lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financiers.
A world where every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to defeat this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give a mark on their right hand or on their forehead that no one can buy or sell, because he has the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, who has understanding, who weighs the number of the beast.
For it is a human number, and its number is six hundred and sixty."
The film Argo: Call Hollywood if it's the worst
In November 1979 a mob of Islamic students occupied the US message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the release of the wounded Shahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had held the pattern over decades over his regime.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the boat overboard because this would have greatly damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not in the position of Iran, where the revolution in the introduction of a theocratic regime was supposed to bring about the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the call of the United States, and the subsequent Fiasko in the violent attempt to release the hostages only made things worse.
The graduates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations by the Algerian Government.
A wave of solidarity, as well as anti-Iranian voices, came to the house.
The debate in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the US for a small part.
Immediately before the message was delivered, six message staff were on the run.
This ended after many complications in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA was able to work with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extraordinary story to cover their true identity - they travel with Canadian passports trained as a member of a film staff who visited Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the Genres
The plan developed by experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to convince the audience, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the firm production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politician, but at the same time also one. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housewife, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This will change the voting levels in the film - on the one hand, the documentaries from Tehran (in the title box, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no big differences in the film setting.
On the other hand, the funny passages from Hollywood, which come in ironically and easily.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in charge at the conference desk, at the office hall, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
A prominent actor has become a respected director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third game film after the Crimea No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City with no gifts (2001).
At the same time, it's Affleks's first film that doesn't play in the local Boston of the director.
The smell of the local atmosphere was part of the features of the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this smell in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are played on the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually taken place - the sequence of the first appearance of the message is very impressive in its transparency, and still conveys the feeling of uncertainty and unpredictability, which occurs when the story is once moved.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team also in fictional scenes (the fake movie tab on a basear in Tehran).
Too many operations at too many locations
The director also had to point out that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film.
But with the small, he works quite well, where he sometimes helps with the reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the coming crisis on Teheran airport is rejected by a telephone in America, or even the persecution on the starting road, seem to do something.)
The weakness of Argo is its widespread stress, which is required by necessity, to show too much to deal with too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures have earned more space, and thus they are not alone in the film.
Afflecks Film is losing something on learning. It is a film that you can follow with a certain interest and go through the design and the retro-style that reminds you of the 70s.
However, it is only a matter of concern.
However, as a reminder of a certain way of living piece of history to this day and as evidence of how the notions of the powerful and all-knowing secret services are overemphasized, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the launching of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually raises a question about the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Unsurprised regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"This idea brought us to the EU's most recent plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrick Nacher, who was concerned about the organisation of this survey against the newspaper Právo.
For example, among the so-called absurdities, there is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
To date, women have benefited from life insurance as they are objectively at lower risk for insurance companies.
"More unbelievable incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The EU's conflicting regulations include, among other things, the binding restriction of bioethanol on fuels resulting in natural damage, which further prohibits the reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small amount of these hazardous substances, or also the Directive on the size of coal-depleting substances, which has been significantly more expensive this year.
Critics in the past also rejected the actual ban on the use of the term "butterastrach" or also the ban on sale for conventional glitchers.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose requirements are generally met in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, Czechs are currently trying to implement the demands of Czech banks with Veto smoke).
Lobby interests also claimed that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not be "crowding anomaly".
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the unanimity of national standards that would prevent trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been strengthened with the indication that the previous guidelines would lead to food poisoning.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of the past year, which, according to air balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age cannot blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU has been involved in an American study, which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of abortion in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market flows.
Kuriose accidents are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which concerns European officials themselves - any who assume official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankonnípoplatky.com server appointed, in cooperation with the association of liberal economies, Laissez Faire, in addition to the doubts about the EU regulation on the scope of food products in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus established the highest volume of food products that remained in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
Chechnya then passes over the determined volume for pill storage, for which we suffered a high amount of money punishment.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money in order to ensure that they have no more, or from the idea of providing aid for applications for aid.
These ideas were free not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are blessed that we have no more.
We will be asked to return to the EU," said the then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the contractors were very high and that the state warehouse was filled because of the so-called intervention purchase.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaport, the EU should pay us EUR 100 million according to Pala 100 million.
Finally, the European Commission rejected the Czech Republic so far as it organized a petition on the purchase of land from countries which have no access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), calls on the Communities for funding for the establishment of grants to Brussels.
EU: Foreign regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States, however, are easily addressed to the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and therefore also to develop the effectiveness and development of the whole European Union, in the opinion of some experts.
A serious problem is, according to these experts, the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the expansion of European integration, but which have been forced into negotiations by individual Member States.
It also calls for the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight against the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always won.
However, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoukké vorážęjky" could be defended, the Inlanderum (Tuzemský rom), whose tradition was restored by us until the 19th century, however, our producers had to be named "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products of sugar-roor distillate, not for products of sugar-repetition.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipan or Parmaschinken are now also included in the company of the world’s famous cheese varieties, including the Karlsbader Zwieback, the Pohorèlice and Treboň, or the Saazer Hopen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Horícer Rolls can break.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of candidate for the office of the President?
I'm not going to be a senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I would apply anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plagued for 20 years, how Dibe is free to go back, while people are increasing taxes and pensions.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am over 40, independent and partial, I have no other chance to influence things than to apply for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you made it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I've been telling me all the time that I'll take the fight around the city after the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made this clear and said that I would apply for the President's office if I was elected to the senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we are swimming as people in the bathroom and in front of the TV, but that we make everyone who wants to change something.
To this end, the media that want to rob one of honor and to exchange the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was thought to be a journalist or to be a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the borough has taken place with the emphasis on the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with reciprocity statements of assets over 20 million dollars.
You need to change your rules.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used myself to ensure that the tour guide remains free of charge, and this could be applied.
The problem is the small policy - if a person comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this will be deliberately rejected, and this is the only thing the population can do.
As an independent participant, I have a greater potential to receive support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take the best for our country without having to think about reading and participating classes from each party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more right or left?
From a Czech look, I think people see me on the left.
For me, this right-left mind is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we go on.
I don't care if anyone is on the left or the right side; I want to connect people.
I support every good solution publicly, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You miss someone who calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to do.
You can call this a populism, but all the suggestions I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will be left with only words of defeat.
And that's why you don't get very far in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you just talk to people for a long time, it will be possible, for example, to pass over material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other chance.
Politicians, journalists and the public are convinced and try to put them on our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the Presidents of Parliament to live in the television to legalize the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and state officials.
And then the speakers had to say, "Why do they deny it?"
A strong personality that points to misunderstandings can exert pressure on the political scene.
You only take the direct choice of the president who was a minister of public press.
I'm very clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find links to my views and visions.
With politics, I just started and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things on my own; and if it doesn't work, then I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little less like Okamura Chechien should be saved.
I'm not a judge.
I know that I have not achieved anything alone; that is why I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they wanted to apply for the Senate too.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jancăra, who refused to work because of his work load.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the confusion in trade with light olive oil.
I started my application on the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the voters did not go to the elections at all, and most representatives of the establishment have been elected.
In the Senate, we are only two independent people.
People have chosen such a synthesis that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district leaders.
Do you think about setting up a private party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to check the past of any potential member, nor have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZKs.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property statements, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at about $60 million.
In Prague, I have a basic piece with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Scodu Superb that is worth about one million. And then I have a few million more on the account.
On the other hand, the Aston Martin was a child's room - James Bond had always liked me as he walked in the car, was flirting with women, and fought against evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have 60 million assets and have no money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want your own money to invest in it.
That's not quite convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some accusations?
I've already placed 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program may not have much interest.
And I am not obliged to combat the campaign from my own means.
The costs for the campaign are basically covered by my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live alone from the senator's content; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I wouldn't ask for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this does not depend on the height of the volume.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my representative will be the head of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live with something.
What month income were you used to be an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still going on.
However, as President, I would set up my businesses entirely.
The full conversation will be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not just in the head - for example of Spijkenisse and the most recent bookerberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we need a book today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man today goes voluntarily into this old-style library, right?
Spickens, a hardly necessary sleeping town in front of the Rotterdam Towers, is a unique record holder.
The 80,000 resident municipality shows the lowest education rate in the whole Netherlands.
In order to counter this foolish condition, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build up the seven fissures displayed on the euro pedestals as well as finely defined steel concrete minerals.
The success of education-offensive was limited.
And so the mayors recognized that there was only one chance to become the statistics of the Lord: a library must be here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdamer Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the Tolling Barken Diagrams and manufacturer of white, yes often zinic buildings, took the matter with normal tolerance and appeared to competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under arm and a border in the face.
And while the jury was still pretending to look and tossed with the axles, the fresh Maas stood up to his readings of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionist submerged speech with the words: "Love City Community!"
So this is my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro of your mountain has been destroyed.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes deep garage, supermarket, post and a couple of adjacent housing houses with 50 apartments.
In early November the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is why the invisible small town tertiary, which to date had no more to offer than a post-modern footing zone and an unfathomable haphazard, would be able to prevent a mollusc tree from reaching a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, there is now a record of the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under Käsegloke.
There is a lift that leads through mountain massives, but the true space and reading joys are created at the steady pace of the topography.
The surrounding interior is bright and transparent, the hot, warm, and elegant streets speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at Parkbank, dog and football boys and girls.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally the books are standing along the Fassad, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is most uncomfortable and personal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on the head and pushed the reading range from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used: Offices, Internet Library, Schachclub, Environment Centre and House Engineering Centre are located in the center.
A special joy is the black booker regals, which are sometimes wall clothing, sometimes chestnuts, sometimes mountain landscapes.
Optics, captiques and gurus are foreign.
Even softest architects and construction engineers will shoot the head of the unknown building.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the town community store, at the request of the standard.
And that's how we spent a day on a suitable waste from agriculture in a free-land farm.
For many years it has been used in the Netherlands in garden houses and in fields as a millimetre-day plastic bottle.
It's cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, then it's rich for the sperm mill.
For the library, the flesh - first in these quantities - was printed into four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogenous, taxable material, which reaches up to Newwagen and up to sports.
After 105 levels, it was reached at the summit.
At the end of almost 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch crochets and fined fig trees.
They provide for atmospheres, especially for the correct air humidity in the literary mountains.
Spending for the New Souls
"I wouldn't believe it anymore, but this house, despite many glass areas, is a preview project in puncto Ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and cooled with heat.
Although the bücherberg is located under a glass pane, the sun seems to itself on sunny days only briefly into the interior.
The wide range of wood chains, which are on the glass façade, serve as pollution and captures a large part of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is caused by complete automatic rollovers.
Stefan Spermon, the original scaffolder from the IT industry, is already on the way to the new books.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the bookieberg as the spy's "long-lasting soul".
The reason: For opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to purchase a book from his personal file.
This is the first time that the optical gaps in the complete library - now 70,000 pieces - should be filled.
The concept is over.
The regals are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than half a library," says Architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for a zirde.
In this way, MVRDV has achieved those royal disciplines, which is referred to as the Artificial Identity Foundation.
The records have written literature history.
She's so young and untrained.
This is finally a point of reference for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a larger role"
Germany has voted in favour of the inclusion of Palestine in the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balanced at a small degree of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first notified that it would vote against the request for a observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin became part of it.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, however, without being critical of Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held the vote when it was about to set up a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy into a German foreign policy, and because of a policy which has been so managed by the US so far.
Unfortunately, the Europeans do not have a coherent and united policy.
The Germans are therefore found between the fronts.
You expect them to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still playing their role, but they're on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in particular from a German perspective?
It shows the willingness to refer to positions of national interest which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is driven by economic policy, so it is from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are at a certain level different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the stand in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one thing, Germany has large retail markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
That is why it must be careful not to stand before the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not like to attach too much weight to it either, that is not a completely exclusive relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German interpretations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by including itself in important decisions of the vote, perhaps in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic mistake as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for this.
Because it indicates that it is taken seriously as an international player and needs to be considered.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
In contrast, the United States has clearly spoken for a Veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has a little bit of understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not even so encouraged by Netanjahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there were a coherent and united European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line, and instead they have to move things out of their own position.
That's exactly what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in driving Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role.
Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - will Germany ever take over a major troll?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes a greater role, different anti-German feelings are free.
That's not easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is seen in a much harder position than the USA.
It must be accessible to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the US's influence on European policy is constantly taking place, but the EU is now filling this vacuum, but who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and they still make a lot less popular - c'est la vivo!

"Marken protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is also a well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
However, a name officially registered in China which does not have anything to do with the company of origin.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the actual names don't complain.
And even then it's not clear whether they get the right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney in Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in protection violations in Fernot.
Every week a new case occurs on my desk.
The neighbors already have a few additional letters to register their brands.
It's just going to be Lu-Gucci from Gucci, instead of Prada, you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sport product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the brand office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company was allowed to protect the product mark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world masters are in copying and losing their spiritual property.
In large cities there are multiple shopping houses that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's cases are different: In his mandate, he assumes that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected otherwise.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpia" a banner.
The word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
In this way women are meant to be hired by rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"It's harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand will be watered, the isolation will disappear, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive preview products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing market in China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, solutions to dubiotic entries in the market register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be withdrawn with an unknown exit.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court filed complaints because after the long time of the alleged name has become "martreality".
If the plaintiff has Pich, he must pay the plaintiff even money because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Known cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction manufacturer, Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete-pump penmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the fight was cleared, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against neighbors from Hong Kong and Singapore who looked at the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
The brand name CTMO in Beijing, however, has given rise in 2010 to fewer staff and space equipment.
In the past year, however, "notification back to normality at work".
The file should therefore be reduced by 22% to unprocessed claim procedures.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81.500 requests for completion are still pending in the office.
Getting up in days costs a lot
As often as in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for market protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This would be a record and means that China will introduce the list of new notifications to each other around the world, sharing with the authorities.
It also applies to the stock of all valid brands, total 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were charged with fees.
It is simple to say that each login will cost 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the contrary, it costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has fought against a Chinese plagiarist.
However, the Germans were able to realize that their illicit manufacture of imitation motor vehicles had been removed.
However, the successor continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg mark.
It has failed itself because family names cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand name CTMO also shows the claim of the Munichers.
In the next two stages, Freudenberg was right, but the opposition continues to fight.
You have to take care of yourself.
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and commends the professionality of the court.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely exciting and costs us much time, money and nerves."
The internal costs are hardly to be taken into account that the firm archive must have been through centuries of old documents in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the other hand, launched a "high-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-desix-six-desix-six-desix-desix-deres
"You see how much we deserve," Wentzler says.
The dangers in Fernot are even moving back to Europe.
Then, if there are unprotected brands.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has been up for a long time, but it was able to withdraw the registration.
"I have to take care of myself," Wentzler says.
Both he and the attorney Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to leave on international market rights, more countries should "sign in China whatever is worth of protection," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is under the last act of his trademarks, then it may be necessary to pay the opposite license fee for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be forced out of the market in the question segment.
World day: stamps, songs, help
In Heidelberg the Chor Impongi - and in Swaziland, Aidsweisen rejoices about it.
The history of a connection that exceeds 8733 kilometres.
First of all, the stamps are: Cowboystiefel, basketball shoes, lady pumps and master slippers looking for the park floor, find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then, the voices of the singers slow down - old, bass, tenor, and soprano - bend and follow.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductors, almost got it out of his pockets when he brought them together with his smiling wishes.
It is Montagabend, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Impongi tries a new song.
Fifty singers and singers have come from 23 to 69 years of age from the human geneticist to the housemann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chorstome has another text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help help
There are around 34 million HIV infections worldwide, which is estimated to be unaided, the United Nations AIDS prevention programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS survivors live.
More than 40 percent of the population are among HIV positive.
For 180 Aidsweisen in Esitjeni village, the United Voices for Africa Paten has been found in Germany.
70 of them attend a continuing school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patent.
It ensures the child’s education, training and a warm meal in the Gogo centre every day.
Impopi means to Zulu historian or also praiser.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this space, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the Chor Lieder has been practicing in this foreign soft language and has brought it back and back to where they originally come from: in South Africa.
As 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German Chores.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some even in simple leather and cotton huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they are infected with HI virus.
In Esitjeni it is shown in small, all over Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
cuts in the male population, which significantly reduce the risk of exposure to half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than 14 percent of the people in Swaziland take the immunosuppression virus into themselves, with the average death rate is not rare.
At a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, Chor discovered the village, but above all, the Inpois saw many children on the streets, not only lack of parental care, but also failure at all: food, clothing, education.
Without a school term there is no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal every day.
A year later, however, the Chor founded the "Voices for Africa", who was almost professionally concerned about the AIDS virus in Esitjeni.
Facts for sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI is called Syphilis, Chlamydi and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STI are HIV, Human Papillomavir, Herpes Genital or Hepatitis.
Phyllic acids and creams belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main target groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are primarily seen in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute suggests that at least four of the five cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chlamydian infections, trichomonates, candidosis (pilz), triples and human papillomavir are frequently reported sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in these countries - yet: around 20 percent of the new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydian infections are significantly more common than in other population groups.
In European studies three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavir has been reported frequently in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
The number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has returned since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disorder?
Infectious diseases may cause hives in the genital area, complaints of urination, rash, subproductive pain, as well as swelling or vomiting.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unknown.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of arrest, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because, in part, cancers of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through stomach infections and severe physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular investigations, especially in case of frequent exchange of sex partners.
Early diagnosis can heal most STI and avoid delays.
Through patents, donations, and not least the gags that the Chor is exposed throughout Germany, some come together.
"All of us have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the Union.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and powerful woman, manages money from Germany.
She is also concerned about the well-being of the widow, at one of the grandparents.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 visas, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day for school education.
Whoever has no one else, comes into the shelter house to Khanisile, an independent woman who is paid as much by the union as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has called a nearby school in life, built two houses and organized with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have allowed a HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because the disease is so obvious in the whole country, and it is the most loved one who is dying.
A King With 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it is rare in a country where the King officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his extreme lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also responsible for this state-funded form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms give it to every corner," says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flash to flash."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imongani-Chor travels all together for two, three years through South Africa and sings songs full of enthusiasm, battle spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness that many still know at the southern edge of the black continent from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites, singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings praise and joy, but also some Grimming Border Soldiers have already exhausted a few trains.
The trip will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patent children.
Even if you rarely find the small village on land maps, it is more known than in the valley of the Ezulu River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And if you go back to Heidelberg the 8733 kilometers airline, to the impressive singers in the probeum on the mountain road, then you can see that too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Merkur
The Messenger's sin has found evidence that there is evidence on the planet Mercur Eis.
The icedeck may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercur.
Although he is next to the sun, there is also frozen water, as does studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The sin of the messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cap in the region permanently in the shadow of the planet.
This should be at least 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that are attached to the mark.
No one brings the fund of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in relation to it, said the chief scientist of the messenger-sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mark can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the funds could help to clarify how water and other structures of life have been reached in other areas of the solar system.
Notably, earth’s inhabitants are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth: Small gucklöchers in endless distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, does not "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomy Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared takeover of the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless stars: The oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the constellation.
This star-shaped region - by scientists called unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in Cassiopeia's star image, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This distinctive glut of a dying star has taken up the spy telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-forming ring consists of material that drew the stars out of the star process.
In the huge trifide Nebel, 5500 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
Nasa's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth scene.
The Plejaden Starhouse, also called "the seven sisters", can be seen at night with the only eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better literate.
As a red age the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is 700 light years away from the Aquarium star image.
Its similarity to an Irish continent brought this Nebel the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides a more spectacular coloring.
These babies could only be included in his full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As these have been created, is one of the great ruins of astronomy.
They may be the rest of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most severe recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
After coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies will be made of real works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows the thousands of light years away from the Trifide Nebel in the Star Image of Protection.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (triggered, tripled) as dark dust flows divide the shining heart of the star birthplaces.
In the star image of the slanger, astronomers photographed the advantages of a cosmic carbolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two moving galaxies are intermittently collating.
This star birth marked the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
None of the technical cuts are available, which may be named after their top name of the southern crater.
The photo of the World Space Telescope Hubble shows an extract from the Irisnebel in the star image of Kepheus.
The 1400-year-old Nebel is made up of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This picture was combined with optical and X-ray abstracts of various telescopes.
It shows a call from black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of Galaxies, named Arp 273, adopted the World Space Telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The largest spiral galaxy called scientists UGC 1810.
In this starboard is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The stars always produce new Youngsters.
Also these stars clouds, connected with the Rosetten Nebel, bring on the current new babystars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was created shortly after the Urknall, when he was found in the universe too much water.
Our views in All: The most important telescopes
The telescope was to be discovered in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galileo used it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes has been increasingly large - and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescop in the Palomar observatory was the world's largest remote power station near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is located.
It lets look into All the same over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Grand Telescope Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Part of the valuable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the high angle.
Its speciality: the high force of light.
This is the wealth of the world’s largest mirror telescopes, although relatively small.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers will hear all of this from outsiders.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing computer services.
Look at the observatory of the European Stargate (ESO) in the Chilean Andeans.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honour.
With its total four mirrors, the remote can also clarify the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extreme Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover 42 meters - and with almost 1000 play elements together.
But with images it is to be calculated early in 2018.
By 2007 both Keck Telescopes were considered the Hawaiian Vulkan Mauna Kea as the world's largest.
They offer at least two mirrors with an average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is still looking at them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
The Mauna Kea is also supposed to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be illustrated.
The most important impressions from all, however, are provided by the World Space Telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images from remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the World Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolated planets - mainly for those who are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest launch preparations are documented on the world-wide telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot into All by an Ariane5 rocket on board in early 2018.
The primary mirror of the world-wide infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Orknall.
Scientists believe that there is also the southern pole of the Eis.
However, there is no reliable data for this, since the messenger is much closer to Nordpol around the planets.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is an Eis on the market.
The messenger probes launched in 2004 - the first ones that surround the Mercuri - now have confidence.
Drink butter daily - and 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A survey in the country where 97 years of age are still young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A survey in the country where 97 years of age are still young.
The road through the Italian mountains is called wild-romantic.
The small bus runs across the curved road, across densely controlled hills, flowing rivers and simple farm houses.
It's all green and soft, you could think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is the Caucasian group of the Talysians, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very long.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is surrounded by too well-managed architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come almost here, too sad is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours because the road is just one track.
The so-called wealth, which the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the testimony to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum for Longevity, although it is the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight thousand Thais from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child is still shown
However, the controversial star of the museum is the Schafhirte Şirali Müslimov, who was supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in the eyes of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Muslim's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, he was supposed to have shown another daughter at the age of 136.
So Şirali muslimov has been counting on his age for several decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an elderly researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been among the top members of Central Asia.
"There are also many high-ranking people in some areas of China, Japan or Hungza-Tal in Pakistan," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia, there are very many very old men."
However, because of the lack of data, there is no scientific evidence to indicate the age, especially the lack of personal status registers.
Squalled butter every day
In fact, the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why are there so many high days here in the south?
The Assyrian travel leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Italians.
The director of the Museum Fatulayeva believes it is on food.
However, that calculates the calorie cost of the salads to be so healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, milk products, and many of them drink a glass of dried butter every day, does not appear to be just fun.
Or is it the original way of life that people hold young? In Chegemiran, a Winzien settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she is still quite young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 trails, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butterfact, which she immediately jumps and rumbles.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both are the oldest parents.
Two kids also jump out of here.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical wooden armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and glid, under her head cover she hides long, dark-brown apples that her son is proud of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out to me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly interest rate enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, vegetables.
For the rest of my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the second world war in time.
But everything was better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the Ruder.
The propaganda sounds rarely from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is carried around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the Ruder.
There is no note under Azerbaijan's age.
230 minutes (i.e. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as interest, for these ratios a amount from which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayvas has a grown son who has been right, "The old enjoy our culture."
They live among the great family, are loved, cared for, and are happy.
If that's not a reason, stay as long as possible in life
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Revaliding customer communities in Cairo reveal the deep column of the country.
The future treaty with the Scharia as a basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian president did not share with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he reaches, lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian leaders, the liberals, who have been declared Muslims and sculptors.
Because all of them, so far, are hopelessly divided into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state on the Nile of grace of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He said that Mohammed Mursi was almost guilty of interrupting the competences of the Constitutional Court and extending his competences to "save the revolution".
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate at the U.S. University of South California, really wants to save himself from being the Egyptians, is not quite clear of the world.
Whether the toolbar should be visible.
In fact, the 234 articles, which were reviewed in a nightly 15-hour parforceritt by the Islamic-dominated 100-head constitutional assembly, are partly concerned.
As in previous constitutions, it is also called in the draft, which is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what's "principles"?
This was and is an excuse and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the smooth formulation and the resulting legal space for a stricter interpretation of the Scharia.
At least one new article has been added: In all matters relating to the Scharia, the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country, with great radiation power in all Sunni Islam, should be taken.
This must not be done, but it can mean that spirituality is the rule of law, which the fact would have led to the expulsion of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation
Problem also: Civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
According to the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were killed in military war.
The State should also, as it is in the draft, "the true beings of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their moral and values".
It is legally formulated in such a way that state institutions can control the content of film and literature using this article.
In fact, it doesn't mean anything else than censorship.
There is no other article that explicitly states the equality of men and women.
Another bans the prophet Mohammed and his envoys to policy or transgress.
But what is an entertainment and how it should be handled remains unclear.
The formulation also requires that "man's welfare" be prohibited.
Is there already a karikature of the president or a white one at the expense of a law teacher?
The issue of interpretation, as much as in the draft, is the Mursi sign and, according to his words, the Egyptians will be presented to the people's vote.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been against the power of Muslims for weeks.
Ten thousand gathered in an unusual entry on the freeway at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and agreed to bring the chart to fall before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
In his short-term Twitter service, he sought to lead the attachment of Mursis to a "push against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and shoot him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brother's blood is still not healed," the Egyptian media urged opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organised Muslim frederity, on the other hand, became a face show, but not at the Tahrir Square, but after a massebet at the other Nilufer before Cairo University.
Many trained women and followers of the Salafists participated in it and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi: "Stain the land!" and said: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A fight about the height over the symbolic Tahrir Square, at which all its beginnings had been fought, would probably have raised civil war-sacrifices.
The Mursis attachment didn't seem to be risking it.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the Constitution and the sponsors had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamic design is considered safe.
"The Word of Human Rights never comes before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have taken place by February and would have brought all the social forces together.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in or before the court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their vision of the world, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
He was tortured, sentenced, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi Mäthauszömung on all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are eclipsing anti-democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President puts it out of force," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle at the Nile with a mixture of novelty and tension.
That could be a dream.

Rakfish from Norway: Is this the world's richest fish?
The five million Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on a fairly vast fish?
A selection of superior cheese varieties is taken.
You place them in the midst of a dark, cold sports dress.
And leave her there for a week.
This is how you have to imagine the surrounding smell of rakfish, one of Norway's great delicateities.
I'm in the small town of Fagerne, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this heartbreaking motion in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfish is a salt-based forle that - depending on how smelting it would have liked its fish - is fermented into water for up to a year.
When the darkness over the country comes and the weather cools down in Norway, Norway is streaming to a festival here in the prisoner, which is now, really very specialty.
"Man eats it raw and then spits it down with a glass Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firehouse, but also organizes the festival as the so-called "Rakfish-General".
In order for us to spend a lot of money on fish and take a lot of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfish," Havard says.
The spirits can destroy the spirit.
I bought some pills.
If you avoid taking the fish to Nassen, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a right long bus ride behind her.
Rakfish is the product of a very different, wider Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drank in the autumn in atmospheric salt-water fatty fats.
In the worst winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt, was consumed with alcohol - alcohol - contaminated.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and to travel mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, driven by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old Rivalen, who not long ago was far more rich than Norway, strong immigrants.
Rakfish is regarded as something more important - as an essential, even more extensive part of Norwegian history.
He belongs to the terrible courts that can be bought here.
But actually, everything is expensive here - a small glass beer or a sandwich costs a total of 10 euros.
Norway does not often create world pressure, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here it is still to be called Anders Breivik on behalf of those racist legal extremists who have been shot in the last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, you're only referring to the "Event of 22 July".
Norway is making it difficult to accept that someone in its peaceful country is capable of such brutal killings.
The growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been largely responsible for the wealth of Norway since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," says Anna, our mother-in-law, who distributes round tablets with rich rakfish and with her long blue hair and the rising blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a people - as you say - conscious people.
Your English is just like most people here without makeup.
We're not very upset, we don't like jokes.
Norway has been very careful with its oil supply - a large part of the industry's revenue is invested in a special fund for the well-being of future generations.
When in the years until the global economic crisis, all with money that they did not own, Norway had to close its bank accounts.
"As long as we can ride the winter ski and travel in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat rak fish," she adds with unscathed milk.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court - I've had enough of rakfish.
So an Elch citizen is in any case something else. The soft flesh can hurt me.
But in the evening, the fish is again on the food table.
The hotel in which I log in is one of the most event types that organises a rakfish diver, with the guest for the best - or perhaps the smells of the most challenging - fish can vote.
There is a live TV switch to a showmaster dressed with fly, surrounded by tenters with rak fish.
The spectrum is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
You're smiling and laughing.
A man falls down from his chair, possibly overcome by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the tough cloud of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead for him and his people's mixed feelings.
The traffic in Mexico City is currently very bad.
Even in the best days, this is a city that is always closed, but on Monday a steel ring was created, blocking several important traffic routes into the main city and taking care of the streets for Chaos.
However, the aim was not to disrupt Pendler's way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential ties and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's in charge of a complex task.
Under the different government, Felipe Calderons has managed to save Mexico economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My Government is very committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto explained this week at Oval Office to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this objective.
Before he went to the U.S. President-in-Office, Pena Nieto was in charge of his home state in Mexico.
In this close, far-reaching part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions on the new state capital are shared.
A Direct Man
In the small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you will be happy to remember it.
The inhabitants of the holiday area write to him about the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the roads that opened up the Pena Nieto and represent a great improvement in the narrow, narrow streets that it once had here.
Platelets with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the Pena Nietos Party.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera, Congressman, says that after 12 years the party has been outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The reasons for the opposition, which the new presidents lack, are substantial, will be reduced.
He was a very direct man, very engaged and had great plans for the country.
He was an outstanding stateman, but above all, he was also someone who could listen.
But on the other hand, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the crowded streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under road transport and in many respects represents a city of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to fight drug gangs operating in the quarter, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In one country, Brachland was left alone in the last two years with thousands of women killed.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, in Mexico, over 1,000 women were murdered - a statistics that the city of Ciudad Juarez himself is being overreached, which is reported for their violence and the murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos are of the view that he has not dealt with the problem of women's murder during his official term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the four that come down, Irinaa Buendia fights with the trains when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events followed Mariana 2010 attempted suicide.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life-threatening.
"When I came home, it seemed as if your body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was shot, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached to a cross that holds a single word: Justice.
But that's exactly what the family has been doing.
The authorities have treated me if I'm a pigeon, an orphanager, a Norglerin.
They want you to simply accept your sentence and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many mistakes and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's pledge on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Ten thousand Mexican families have been brought together in the last six years by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to take care of this problem during his official time.
"I hope he is as President as he was governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, most of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza were afraid.
The government government claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about mishandling
The government government protested Bradley Manning's case, and he was taken to prison.
The hearing is with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a derogation from the complaint due to strict conditions of liability
The U.S. Army's release is expected to have thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the U.S. government government tried to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest confusion of confidential information in the US history - failed several times to complain about his alleged military abuse.
During a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained that documents for weekly visits by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month prison time in Quantico, Virginia did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the crossing hearing, which resulted in a request for the defence to be dismissed - if Manning had already been punished enough by the hard summer, Manning had said that he had raised the Swiss prisoner in prison.
The U.S. Army's secret service provider, arrested in June 2010, is expected to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein met Manning through the forms that the officers had completed their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been subject to increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday about the forms, Manning added that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, such a fine, did not include complaints about mistreatment, even though officials had asked directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his thoughts orally and that the officials would have talked to him and told him to deal with them, but they had not been protocoled.
"They write (after discussion of the concerns) "No problems" and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011 that should investigate the suggestions he had mentioned in a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to allow his observation status to be limited to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had given him this restrictive status - a level of suicide threat - to his own and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince my staff that I was doing well, and to clear out the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday about his arrest and detention in Kuwait, where he was arrested nearly two months before he was transferred to the Cantico Marine Basin prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had committed suicide and was once unconscious because of the heat.
They must not know what happened to him or to the outside world.
"My world broke down on Camp Arafjon, on this cabin together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his day in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a matrice, a blanket, fllip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
Sometimes he had to sleep with light, which came out of his cell.
If he had turned around at night and could not see his face anymore, he would have woke him up so that he could turn back again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally filed a complaint against Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night night in his cell in Quantico and had to stay in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning had said that he had never had the opportunity to fill himself with his cover during this number.
At the interview on Friday, Manning said that he had concluded from an order of his watch that he should let the deck fall with which he could cover himself, but he said that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep the night before. He had tried to show an officer that he did not pose a threat to himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could use the band of his underhospitable or flipp-flops to harm himself, but he didn't.
On this night, said Manning out, his underhospitable, fllip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take account of his case and reduce his case dramatically, he should be judged before the military court for the first time in the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be recognised as less guilty, while other complaints that are considered too extreme should be addressed.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this week. A legal remedy is expected from the government.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been established in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held in Quantico under the highest security conditions.
The charges against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the unjust publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the loss of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all charges, he is sentenced to a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame immigrants - they call them hard times to remember, he says.
Navarret is the view that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a short trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had reached the pass control when there was a riot in me.
They refer to two waiting languages: one for "Mexico" ("Mexico"), another for "Extrajeros" ("External").
I've been there for a few seconds, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called "Mexicon."
An ethnic circle - just like my friends in Boston called "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandmother's home there was no need for chirels or binders.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at the end of a interview.
But I don't have a native speaker's vocabulary, and I won't lose my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put me in the shoes for strangers.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda are all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today, with the same high probability of staying in Mexico, are moving away from the United States instead.
He wanted to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has a hard time going on fighting Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resensitivity.
Most Americans may never have a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and that the country's leadership under the alleged threat would be forced to leave more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, reminders of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official is just the calmest criticism in Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country - complaints about how Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the path of war.
And the biggest challenge in Mexico is actually with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Lust, talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people who offer opportunities for the country, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - did not get a chance in Mexico and fled to the north.
And in most cases this person has a profile - dark, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we can never lose sight of the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes deleted as far as possible, but what concerns our loyalty is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership are not interested in us.
This is based on the opposite side.
They see us as the mouthpiece of a doubling lowland and look at us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Your opinion that our existence is a symbol of the shadow.
If our families hadn't been separated in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves behind the wall now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legalized as a child in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans are used to doing this.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling not to belong to another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You're enjoying the best of both worlds, but you're not upset about it.
In Mexico we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should have learned during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican driving people and parts of the education community want to re-establish their links to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "messengers" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press on the political leadership to intensify its commitments to Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unencumbered corruption and the drug habit, many of us are not even sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico for half a century ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are trying to raise a hole for how their family members were treated before even so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old-fashioned, new Middle East
The armed situation between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected fundamental cause of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to share such a hope in the Keim.
In the midst of the regular school visits, there were free buildings in protection and ass, more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were killed by civilians and six Israelites, and for the first time rockets from Gaza were captured near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, unknown situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this scourge.
Maybe this will only lead to more bleeding.
However, there are reasons for believing that the fatal condition could finally find its end.
A war that will not be lost or won
At first glance, optimism seems to have been compared to the current situation.
Even if the armed stand agreed on November 21st, this week's wars have strengthened the hardheaded on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have forced Israel back, even though his group had to record large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are taken into one of the most isolated and densest corners of the planet, Israel has not yet managed to destroy the Hamas.
In fact, the Hamas will be added to West Jordan, which will be controlled by the rival, moderated Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas have been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a renewed regional power, which was first considered Israel's first Muslim allies, has reached the Hamas party - exactly like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamicest golf states.
Jubilant Hamas angels believe that Israel is a Islamic half-man - from Lebanon in the north, where the military Hasbollah has power, over Syria, where revolts of an increasing Islamist persecution could arise before Bashar Assad's invasion, to Jordan, where Hamas' allies drag the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim fraternity under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the largest and most important Arab country in Egypt - in the southern part of Israel, has continuously changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laisist Despot, who ruled Egypt until his turn in 2011, had only a little time left for Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood with the Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on volxic views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be expelled from Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, however, are allowed to draw an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly seen Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli rocket reconnaissance system, "Iron Dome", has been safe and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a long time Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
Diplomatically, the United States has taken a stand against its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest scale of violence.
Israel has achieved well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process for a large part.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of self-mortem regimes - not the least thanks to the sprinkler systems that have passed through the country of West Jordan and thus in the main part of a Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal for the nation, but continue to be built.
Netanyahu is good there. Its Likud Party has joined a more competitive group in the pre-election on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these backward Palestinians also ignore and abandon their own state?
If they really had control over West Jordan, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their coroner in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should drive them to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to pass through, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Muslims who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have left little for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defence seat is greater than its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments in their economic recovery.
That the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barak Obama to achieve a state of arms could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolic the beginning of a new era.
Israel too should think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking decisive steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to enjoy their own right of self-determination - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day in Israeli-owned areas, just as a bus in Tel Aviv went off this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only intensify this situation.
Bloodless missions to force Hamas back in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic trip over the years.
Both sides need an east end
The correct answer is those who are represented by the most intelligent representatives of both sides, the majority of the world and of this newspaper: two states in which Israel is engaged in security areas.
The - for the near future - is the hope that the state of arms will give foreigners more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Egypt now has to stop arms delivery in the Gaza Strip with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever before in order to convince the Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by a regional exchange and a joint Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to agree.
This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the previous application for UN observer status.
And Obama must also contribute his part to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own plans of peace.
Far away in the white house, it seems that he would also be able to take part.
But that's a sad, short-term perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single packs of cigarettes
Health warnings and sick parts of the body on neutral green packages equivalent to all tobacco brands
The first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia. To this end, brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive-green blankets, which are also printed with dramatic images, showing sick parts of the body and children affected by cigarette smoking.
From the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names that are printed in identical, small letters is the following day.
Australia therefore introduces the world's strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants young people to quit smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26 will not smoke again with 99% of their probability.
"You can already see in children young adults that they understand the message of trying to hire tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. You invite studies that have shown for example that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the changes will only affect the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought against the laws.
Thus, the law would benefit from black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian falsifiers are offering a wide range of these products on Australian roads.
Others, however, say that the laws have broken their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicondelicts to cover the illegal packages has been enormously high since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies broke their laws two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court of Justice.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
Experts have thus found that the hacks in the population of social media are at the very heart of the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have forced tobacco companies from TV advertising to act as sports sponsors and most traders are forced not to issue cigarettes in business anymore.
The Australian government has banned internet access by local companies and websites, but has no influence on international sites.
"If tobacco is marketed and only a small area left to acquire its products, the Internet is not here," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has identified an increase in experience reports on brands, which were composed of "genz normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is it just a private person who finds such great cases on Marlboro cigarettes that she even has a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing in order to reconcile itself with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to implement the new regimes - these countries complain about unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organization, although no larger trade with Australia is being dealt with.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
Plibersek has subsequently conducted talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to describe the photographic warnings.
In the meantime, they were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are being passed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are still showing up.
The images don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"I just take a kippe and pull the trigger away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette bottle, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in Sydney City, says that the single packaging has made the fulfillment of his rule difficult.
"I used to need an hour ago to sort out a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government would just have to ban cigarettes completely - then we would have told us okay, that was, we'd close," he obviously added.
In a permanent electricized world it is beautiful even to be long-lasted
I spent five hours at the airport thanking this offer when our plane crashed because of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flighter.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about long-distance.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nerve - even if books, magazines and iPhones are available (and of course tax free shopping).
But more and more academics and child development experts lead long distances to something positive.
If it goes after them, it's for us - and our children - okay, occasionally to be bored.
In this way the brain will be forced to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may contribute to creativity.
And because most of us today almost always starve on one screen or another, the advantages of long-term life no longer overtake us.
So should we welcome the longway with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be back.
Like many people, I have always learned that long distances are a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing freedom.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Levely History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"It is true that the long distance has a very long history," he says.
The Pompejis house is a Latin graffiti over longways, which goes back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we really define long distances.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, explains the problem that long distances have been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long lecture in research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that long-term experience as the experience of wanting to perform "a satisfying activity that can't be defined" makes it possible.
Long-term differences vary from Apethie to that the person is not employed, but he wants to be.
However, there is no need to do anything at the Apethy.
The key experience of the long distance, he says, exists in a "distortion of the attention process, coupled with bad noise and the feeling that time just goes away".
Long distances can be almost as much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two attitudes may be related, long-term people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are long-term, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate on.
In her study "The Unencumbered Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Attention" - in Germany about: "The infamous concept: The definition of longways under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed an earlier experiment with a band containing a person's magazine.
Some groups heard a lot of television program from the nearby room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly realistic, while the third group did not take this noise at all.
The people who did not listen to the television offered more long distances than the two other groups - they had problems focusing on them, couldn't find any reason to write and write their difficulties on the long run.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or demanding task, you may be distracted by long-term attention, says Mark J. Fenske, Associated professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you are engaged in an exciting activity - "such as the search for wrong products on a manufacturer's band, music can relax and help you not feel comfortable".
In fact, he says, we now know that summons and criticism, often interpreted as a sign of longevity, can even fight them by staying physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who can be helped around, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," said Professor Fenske.
We all will once again be long-lasting - my late flight, a moving speaker, a particularly exciting film.
But some people prefer longer than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scaling for long-term vulnerability".
On the scale are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With such a scale, researchers have found that boys will become more long-term as girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at West Florida University - in particular with regard to the need for more and a greater variety of foreign travel.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty relaxed dog.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults in school and at the end of household duties had been delayed, although 23% had started being late if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents allowed themselves to feel lonely.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of long distances have increased or decreased.
However, he would be sure that "the youth will be found especially long", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily activities.
So back to my original question: Is Langeweile healthy?
Sometimes not because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into the gambling or drug habit in order to slow them down - this has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between longevity and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the long distance, the brain wants to say something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do just the best.
If one is long-term and uses this energy to play guitars and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can provide short - term benefits for happiness, but they can be long - lasting.
So whoever gets an iPad for his desired child can get away from the longway. However, it has not learned to maintain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, " Self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
Not only does the child learn to control himself but he also has more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate long distances.
We should not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel better beyond the constant pace of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we had to be longer. But long-term is the cool, inflexible desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to relax and relax.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to work if the noise is dry once."
There is no clear guidance for the new marijuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south of Colorado for a trial that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few less marijuana breakers and a perfume he smoked.
Orozco followed him and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer Marihuana found out in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drugs - similar to horses, each with a fine of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We'll be treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But he's also one?
In the weeks following the state's decision to legislate small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug addicts depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of orders about Marihuana are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer pursuing adults over 21 years of age for possession in small amounts. This is legally allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state officials in the conservative regions of Colorado have announced that existing marijuana dealers continue to follow and still call people before the court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed Marihuana business in their communities from opening up to the Western Mountains.
"This situation is going so fast that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, who lies east of Denver.
And the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are suddenly breaking down on the head.
They are looking forward to a orientation aid for the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case the majority of the countries concerned with the regulation of Marihuana, where drugs were legalized only for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. The state is therefore well oriented," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the Washington State Authority for Spirits.
But Smith also suggests that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a grave guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the end of a gradient in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unacceptable practice questions need to be clarified at this time - such as how the state standard of "appropriate access" to marijuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis business around 300 metres for schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere it will be harder to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Ballung area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the Center for Legal cannabis, a recently-trained research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his staff to Aurora an e-mail in which he stated that the government lawyer would not follow smaller marijuana dealers in people over 21 years of age, and that the police would not want to "immediately" any punishment for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban regulations to regulate the growth of medical marijuana and will continue to be followed by drug dealers.
In the World County in northern Colorado, the district state attorney Ken Buck gives a stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his authorities would continue to follow cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present 119 persons have to answer for the possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana before the court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to monitor infringements in which it has been committed at the time of execution," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana Initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the countryside, will no longer show adults for having smaller numbers.
The Regional Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to allow all outstanding possession procedures to fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time exercising the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters supported the measures in Colorado, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the opposite reactions throughout the state promoted a profound challenge for local officials in view of the great green experiment in days.
At the district councils, it was a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is a lawyer for Marihuanadelic who is indicted before the court and acts as a speaker for the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuanages.
"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to punish people for not yet able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to deal with the smaller amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national samples for the legalization of drugs.
As speakers and state officials prepare for a temporary legal sale, they also look forward to instructions from the Federal Government that will continue to deal with the sale and construction of Marihuana in the Federal Republic of Germany as a penalty.
Representatives of the legislative movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be monitored.
Despite more visible arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor of the Obama government, is of the view that criminal officials are likely not to enter the door to challenge smaller amounts of drugs, but are likely to try to tolerate legal, state-run marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not even expect the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new Marihuana businesses, although they could open only in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a town in the west, decided a six-month ban, which may be adopted next week.
"We do not want to say in a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level before a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Treaty.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We refer to what the Community has decided and not to what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was moved from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students from today will be arrested for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I first held for the world's largest science stamp, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great spheres of civilization - free of thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into the Worscester College at the end of the eighth year - there I had been able to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus re-enacted the first scandal of my life.
My father brought in trains together.
My friends were injured.
Inevening Standard, I would have gone because I had a problem with comilitons in the nearby room sex.
The author A. N. Wilson made it very clear that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less complicated.
I love it.
Yes, dear, because I'm getting under systematic push and push.
Not because of my real unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
It was only for one reason that I was schizophrenia - a reason which, in this alleged way, seemed so harsher and harsher: My dying father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant, Margaret Thatchers, and I was the sponsor of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, the current reports lead to a new generation of students of the rights of equal rights under similar persecution.
The organised and growinghass on Tory students in Oxford has developed in the meantime such dimensions that a group of them last week asked for equal rights, schools, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College are given, because of their political views, they will "be actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwilling".
They ask for a place in the Equalisation Committee of their College to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recently published documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Touries were represented as Excentrians and Neonaissians.
This was shown by the former President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, which was founded in a Rolls-Royce with silver-coloured approach and silver-contained jewellery.
Conservative students at other universities say they will be considered as "Studybooks for the introduction of higher student fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing link to universities.
People believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without having any knowledge of us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historian in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unacceptable". Nine-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of Oxford's Conservative Student Association, said that she observed a growing decline in JCR members against students of the corresponding rights.
"This poses a threat to intellectual speech and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I was a member of such a minority.
As an incredible 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The Hass on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had agreed to grant Margaret Thatcher - an ex-school student - no honor due to cuts in high school.
The atmosphere would even have caused Stalinists to stumble.
In the first days of the first semester, when the new students met and the tutors, I received a preview of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only slow down the generation of Tory students, but even with joy.
Political issues such as mountain workers, privatization and the abolition of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the forested areas of the Tutorium.
In my first of these events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (while he was dead), "Please replace the first paragraph."
I'm proud of it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchenette, and quite quiet.
"Do you want to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were staring.
In my eyes, trains came up.
"I suggest that they take a few hours in your time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt said.
I went back to my room with a hanger head.
This evening I was sitting alone in college alone on the evening when someone pointed me slightly at the shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James who represented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Union.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
I'm sorry it's what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be forced to sell.
It's bad enough for me, but she knows that your father is approaching Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
The majority of Tory's first teachers suggest that you be a subscriber to the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to seduce myself.
I concluded that I was not in all points of view with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be a failure.
A student in the philosophy, politics and economy profession, who had visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist witch."
You're tired.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was mean and drunk.
"How's Tories Sex?" asked one.
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt as if homosexuals must have felt before the United States' liberality.
Would I be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be equal only after the collapse of darkness?
Should I use the Labour Party and put up with my natural advances?
The three years that lay before me turned to a fire in my spiritual sight and insulation.
The only tutor to be recognised as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
Not only was he determined to be a conservative, but also because he had consulted Thatcher in foreign policy and had written for them.
He was only rare there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and small-scale and left him for his Marxist-Determinist history perspective.
In 1997, he joined a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to hang between Oxford and the house of my parents and found access to close friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the quarter, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in a small voice.
They'd never do anything like that, not in my city of dreaming turms.
Even my Communist friends always put their hands on the day.
His hot eyes were shaking.
Give the glove a chance.
I'm sure you're just kidding.
It would break my heart if you went.
Created by my frequent journey to London, my emotional resistance has weakened.
One of my men's friends, including Tory's assistants, had followed the pressure and betrayed his beliefs.
During a tutorial next week, when another historian had seriously claimed, I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly hiding in front of Sham, I insisted that my parents had been under a "guarantee", and they called me "old trottel".
The relief only lasted a short time.
It was my father who killed the last needle in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and within five minutes, my hoes opened up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'm glad you can call me a winey sleigh.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in a educational institution under such ridicule and inhumanity.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university, not only the 14 Tory Prime Minister, but it is still hiding behind an undeserved call of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino presents the elegance of fame."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashionmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of holding an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer when he opened "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 skin covers were assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his irrevocable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signor" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always been fascinated by fascination for the fragile and distant world of the Adel.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the last aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise from the famous fashionmaker in Voghera City in Northern Italy to the idol of the international set.
In the adel, to be loved, mustn't be a nuisance.
"At least they don't show their hips on your great carpet, as it does some beautiful monuments from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, great and elegant guest.
"We all rejoice when we are invited to his house in Gstad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a friend of forgotten beauty, such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always proposed the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modemmaker.
Many years ago we went to him after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to go home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he recognized his influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began their journey in Paris during the year of the Haute Couture 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Modern View of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of weakness, rather than of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long walk, which suggested a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the track to admire a dreamful "audience" that holds the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this publication from fashion-pumps, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mete-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgetably."
I can still remember myself perfectly.
It was a house, a hemd, a west type "Gillette" and a jacket from the 1971-1972 Herbst/Winter Collection.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's mice.
"I bring him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he prefers our beauty," adds the ex-hilarator of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and lower the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princesses and head of opinion at the fashion Patricia della Giovanpaola d'Arenberg can also not forget the first time she took a Valentine.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of having finally the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothing...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s, it came to this end.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the close of my vet, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a painted piece of work with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a real dream," says the White of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her night dress from the fashionmaker "with absolute care" because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories."
The King of Mode
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modem named his neighbours) were needed to make this elephant-colored silk garment with pearls, twelve different stitches and a four-and-a-half-metre sweat.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savour-étre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest title of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, distinguished with honor, cumulates Garavani as much honor as any of its customers.
"I have always found his refining, his peace, his entrusted and perfect outside," says D'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him a month ago at a gala supplement at the museum de Orsay.
He was at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was free; the time left no traces of him."
And that says a princess...
The world's toughest profession: the human working class of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the natives of the Indonesian volcano are playing their lives and their health when they take 70 kilos of bicycles over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whose work is hell, and other people work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 mine workers who earn their lives by taking the skilful from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
In addition, every day he has to climb down the floor of his crater, where the excellent liquid gas from the earth is established in contact with the air.
After breaking out a large swivel stone that can reach up to 70 kilos, he transports it in two drums on his shoulders over the escape route from the stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises up to a height of 2386 meters, but the created trees need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the peak of the screen, where they have to keep the balance and carefully set their steps so that they do not break and break.
You know that every step can cost your life, like this happened by a French tourist who stopped at the Kawah Ije bars years ago.
Kawah Ijen's miners deserve 5 Eurocent for each Kilo Swefel that they build.
At the top, they take the road between tourists who take photos of them as circus machines and walk with the surrounding heavy bodies three kilometers to the wall, which a minority company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrribbi, which has been using the Vulkan and (not to be said) its workers, who have paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of the skiffs since 1960.
It then sells for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is expanding daily and is used for the production of raw materials, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the manufacture of sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who makes three trips a day in the usual case.
It takes three hours for each track to complete, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such a terrible non-human effort is the threefold of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15 000 rupees are paid per day (1,2 euros) and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the driver who worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work wasn't so hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village near, and for a reason that is as important as the Swefel in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has Asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often and his eyes are upset because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has spent three years in Kawah Ije's life playing the game whose sweat has already left him the first track, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has Asthma, with difficulty, frequently coughed and his eyes are turned away from the volcano because of the toxic gas.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than accessible English.
This sympathic and intelligent young man who was punished for his life could work as a tourist leader, waiter, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead perform the work of a traitor.
He shares a dirty woody coat with other wearers and stands up every morning for two hours, because the sweater also comes out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines brightly in the darkness.
The shadow challenges him in the light of a small star lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
About 400 wearers load the bodies with a swivel on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the retail company has not been able to afford the ski lift to save costs, and provides the carriers working on their own account and paying for weight, without any equipment.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) in addition to photo equipment, which the farmers of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) require tourists to take photos of the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protests Madrusin, a quiet, 42-year-old prisoner who has worked for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues to "solve it", because he needs the money to train his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to race, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the swivel burns the keel and tears the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners in the thick waves that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases ... of course except the normal respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the bones and blisters on the shoulders that have formed themselves from the weight of the body.
With the basket on its back, Uninik is able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his men break 15 tons of garbage from the volcano, which is transported by three LKWs across a bridge between the bay to the warehouse in Tamanzari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to race, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works as a shoemaker with 30 years of age.
Time goes by, but poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the most difficult professions in the world: those who work as human cargo at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame themselves for not having children, on careers, stress and the costs of real estate and child training.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotist husband, you're my patriot wife: We're fulfilling our civil duty and we're creating lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a release for Minzbonbons, but yet - or just because - they were started this year in Singapore to be a virtual video on YouTube.
The sets are part of a rapper song, the local speech, such as "Schieben will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make yourself fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has run the video, has the hope that the advertising company will arrive in a funny way and pay attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people into line with their "national obligation".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and intelligent.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst farmers in the world, so we noticed that it is a matter of concern to us.
We knew that the government had tried many times, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of speed-dating apples (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to solve this problem, such as making a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Government of Singapore.
Each year it spends $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything was so far less successful.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservationism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the rate of birth is currently 1,2 children per woman.
The last time this rate fell over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans get children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Marriage and Family Policy of the National People's Authority, says this will lead to a "better education" and a "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people not only to marry and to form a family, but also to have significantly more options for goals in life and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social context have contributed to the higher number of unmarried people and to the increase in the birth and birth rate, resulting in the reduction of the rate of birth in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a dramatic increase in migrations in order to prevent the reduction of the population has led to resensitions in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where almost hidden xenophobies thrive on many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore has achieved its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and duties for foreign workers.
Unexpected follow-up
While the decline rate of births has the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, taxes, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not many small apartments are built.
It already has effects on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "schools" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great deal of sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single - parent and that they can cut down the construction companies to build a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "schohschachtten" will be sold much faster than the larger housing units.
They are as popular, and the units are sold daily and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means they're much better for our Cash Flow.
However, it suggests that the new standards give the developers a clearer orientation, which had previously been put in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way for an increase in the national rate of birth, the discussions with Singaporeans working in the financial sector are to conclude that they will not have a major impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, because it is being thrown out by many," says one young manager.
The kids can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as a reason that they cannot have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - that's why the government can do so much more.
The offline private online is private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "some area of privacy where a claim for protection is made against any form of interference".
What is private for anyone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he knows in Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often online.
In four cases, they linked the term to "something very private" at personal level and "on the password and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be known in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been available for two years over accounts.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games high.
I also spend my time with those who know me.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't from me, or from someone who makes the drumhead."
The young man is aware that it is wrong to publish photos of naked persons, to publish crimes, or to write misleading or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are connected.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just load her up," he adds.
"The social networks are content, I can quickly talk to people in the distance or with friends," he says.
He answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone suggested to him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he does not know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"This doesn't surprise me because we have something in common, for example, music," he says.
After the boy was given no instructions or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or requires me, I simply remove him from my user account" he says.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
The reputation of a friend was expressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then it explains a number of steps to secure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, these young people would upload photos of famous people in uncomfortable or stressful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I'd like to tell him something.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with higher education in education and learning, believes that in order to focus on children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of play have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master title at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who should teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what to spread, publish or say, and this in an age where the range is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective if they are the most important ones, to be liked to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
"Tell them they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras calls for some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it online?
Or: Would it happen to you if you posted a photo of you, like what you published by a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
Have you ever asked the other people for permission when you took photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to give them understanding that they must act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet acts with respect, impartiality and other principles, and must also apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitor
Esturado Guardia, Professor of University, Primary Schools and Teachers, comments that it is inevitable that parents will carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to discuss with their children the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should be theoretically signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Official meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the Office of State and Presidential Authorities first shared that they would pass it after the clause, however, explain that it would be published for some time on the Peruvian Government website.
On questions of the text, they pointed out that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the President's meeting was transmitted to the press, without a tone, with the announcement "private sitting, restricted audio".
The few information gathered among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Hungarian governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speakers.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of the participating Presidents, who reviewed the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media abuses that requested more information.
After that, the Peruvian president sent the media an e-mail with the "Excise Declaration" of the summit, but it was about the declaration of Humala and not about the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Gypfle of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, the press had published the so-called declaration of Lima, which had been announced before, even less.
On the official website of ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were available, but they had a high level of access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint obligation of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague which deals with a cross-border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in the Hague, in the process of leading the Lima against Santiago to listen to both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we now bring to this International Court of Justice," Humala said together with his Chilean opponent.
"Cile was, and is still a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concluded agreements and undermining international courts," Piñera adds, and the largest Humala with a hand in front of the prisons of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit themselves to the IGH was successful following a decision by Colombia on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which had made a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011, has not participated in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State submitted the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
To the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that action would be taken to "improve cooperation in combating insecurity in cities and organised, cross-country crime, and measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to work together and effectively in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphal trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 symbolic projects that should improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian people who placed on the querachs of its coast to Brazil, two of which should provide better connections with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
It also adopted the final document on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the elections in this country will be held in the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting in Mexico on Saturday, that he expected to meet with his opposition from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal with the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH raised by Bogotá in question.
"Maybe I will meet President Daniel Ortega on the dark day (Samsday)," said Santos.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua needs to be discussed with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and as respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Minister for Defence of the Block for the Adoption of the Action Plan for 2013 also met in advance with a view to strengthening the dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of a common state citizenship is a goal, in which "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated at the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europe "has become engaged in the second world war and in other alliances" and "now is practically a father country."
In this regard, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship which the Member States of the Unasur are seeking.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as it is already in the Andean community, must be achieved; however, there are even more reactive sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also recommended that the reorganization of the American States (OEA) be redesigned in order to reduce the influence of the English States and take into account those signed by San José on human rights.
Those who teach are never obliged to do anything, and in contrast, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is unthinkable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has established its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States," he explained as a reflection of the political asylum provided by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not explain his principles, but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that in his time it had given "founded doubts that Assange would be issued to a third country and would not retain its proceedings."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice that he had demanded to be subjected to in his country because of a alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law allows this through a video conference that could have been executed on the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that the risk was that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he's in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the messenger has informed me that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but it's not difficult," said the Head of State Ecuador.
However, there is the risk that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he has been caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises in freedom.
"That would affect the health of everyone," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution for the Asyl, the Assange, has been provided since June in the message of Ecuador in London, is the provision of a free office to which he can travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been conversations with London in order to find a solution for WikiLeaks's imprisoned reasons.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not apply this word to this case, however, it has given constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European institutions," he explained.
And "If the United Kingdom gives this letter tomorrow, this is what I think will be accomplished."
And if Sweden Mr. Assange heard of Ecuador's message in London or over Skype, how it was allowed to speak Swedish law and made in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa used the opportunity to prove himself a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate, "the means, the evil intentions and the lies that the free opinion expressed."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the evil journalists who seek and press for gain," he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that Ecuador would no longer be governed by such journalists "and not even by the banks or hegemonic and spy-citizen countries" and that he "will deepen the revolution to continue in this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organisation "should remain and must not take advantage of opportunism and no state-owned authority" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed".
The President of Ecuador also expresses the desire of his Colombian opponents, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which has favoured Nicaragua's maritime government, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries for "absolutely entitled."
This judgment shall not be implemented at the present time.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a common route in their efforts.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look ahead.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international authorities if both countries commit themselves to accept the judgment, even if it feels very strongly."
With regard to the possibility that he was a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to succeed his third term, he pointed out that he "sees this opportunity with great optimism and joy, even though it sometimes seems very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally been of interest to me, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to take this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I'll get out of public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would expect him to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a return to the health status of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the Ecuadorian Head of State took part in the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death due to AIDS today is a late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the study results: HIV positive.
"It was like if a bomb hits," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor "has tried to give up without noticeable success."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several wars in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic refused to accept, "because it led to a bag."
It was then AIDS Synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who do not know anything about their disease, where the virus has already damaged and created its immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG leader Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that scientists have concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a cause of death, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact of the immune system of people at the beginning of treatment, and that the greater chances that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years in a number of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a number of 500 CD4.
Simply stated, the above statements mean that those who get HIV positive at the age of 25 can become "problemly 75 years old as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to manage this progress properly, it must be borne in mind that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report)) it is still true that 60 percent of patients diagnosed in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people die in Jalisco in 2011 and until May of this year are already 187 deaths; however, it is ensured that there has been universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
So why are people still dying from it?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
That's my opinion, and that's how it's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems with the medications. The problem is that people are in a very advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of disease.
He makes a statement: "Nine of ten patients come to us when they already have a accompanying infection. In order to affect the global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, therefore all people where this is necessary need to have massive recognition tests."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the State Council of State de Preventción del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and the patients like Fabrizio, who conducted their tests on a private laboratory, and this is the only reason why he had a friend who, despite his young age, had already been in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi Sarcom (a cancer tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then put three more times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the medications.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I work a lot, I have an active, but responsible sex life, I look at my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILLENIO JALISCO to identify those who are afraid of his witness today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible as everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the loading table
There are great gaps between the health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, "the distribution of condoms is actually increased; they were given separately, they now give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which are already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need?" is a wide-ranging spot question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, staff in apothecs and in the health system that young people do not want to stand up, the correspondent assured.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be re-oriented; the condoms should be located not only behind the loading table but in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether it would be distributed conservatively under his administration.
"Sexality doesn't look like this; best of all, it's to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen in 4 new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of seizures occur through sexual traffic, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for each registered case.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the commitments of the Vitro Group reached by a trade contest in Mexico, an insufficient pre-trial case has been created for each national undertaking with a lease in the neighbouring country, which has the problem of payment.
Thus, it could be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws have no validity in the country of stars and stripes in opposition to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas is that Mexican companies are being subjected to the imposition of their property outside the Bravo River.
However, the decision is open to the largest lighting manufacturer in Mexico City and Tor to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that believers must be subject to the competition law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, first states that it is in the main proceedings for the trade contest in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for payment capacity of companies with a cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, where the American Law Institute was used as a lighter.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the company's votes after the recognition of the commitments in the competitive mass that the branches of vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the bonds would not be reached.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundes Institute for Trade Contests).
It is also true that, after withdrawing from the votes of the branches, the believers of Vitro, the believers who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier Foundations such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro owes for his difficult situation since 2008 in the United States in the Great Economic Crisis, which was distributed to the country.
For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family argues before the same Court of Appeal in order to make the vote in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
In the absence of the case, the Cercioraire claim, which requires the examination of the proceedings by a higher authority, shall be submitted by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The difficulty in this case is that the court has provided a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (Freedom of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Trade Competition Act and which indicates that it was strictly subject to agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Law.
In addition, it will be pointed out that the country has subject itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border payment capacity ensuring equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
Bilateral carballs: a sword for vitro and for the country.
General Balance
Following the announcements by the Mexican air traffic associations against former owner Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, which is charged with a misdemeanor administration, the Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviados has made final progress.
The attempt by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now introduced a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which will be called for infringement of justice.
The supervisory authority has subsequently systematically refused to inform the principal administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE's F/589 credit account the name of Mexicoan de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrative Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcarraga is the main taxator of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental defenders, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon March in Cancún.
As you know, we speak from a huge shopping and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from outside the wall, supplementing a residential area for the staff of 150 companies.
In the meantime, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has managed to unite the Governors in the south in order to counter the monumental institution that destroyed part of the protected areas and represented the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican messenger in Japan signed the Anti-Conterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known as ACTA's English Abbreviation, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had taken the opportunity to take account of them because it considered them to be an obstacle to the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex Long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings more than 500 million pesos to the market.
The issue is the first of four equal emissions to make a profit every 28 days.
Establishing Competival
Based on the NICE, e-Quality and Corenet companies, leading information technology companies, a group was established under the name Competival, whose target is the software cluster service market in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bomber of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been linked to corb sport for more than 60 years and has prepared the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes had been part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, full-time and leader of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball league.
"I've spent many years in the basketball, even several times at the same time as I was President of the BSN, Head of the National Alliance and President of the Alliance in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when he was visited by Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exceed this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón and Hearts
The most emotional memories are those who, at his time, remember the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old jubilé as a business leader or director of the club.
"That was my best years, which I have enjoyed most, because I have been part of eight Masters of the Vaqueros since 1967 whether it was a business leader, a business leader or a coach.
There were many satisfying years, including the five masters from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted myself with a master's degree in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" has taken over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was appointed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommends the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who made himself a citizen and was one of our best promoters.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had made a mastership for Bayamon, it would be good for another one.
The masterdom of the Vaqueros with Gausse was given to him, but he was already out of range because he was already at the top of the league in 1988.
At this time, he proposed to enjoy his full-fledged and those of Mincy in the National Mission.
I still know when we first won the first time in the pre-lympic tournament in Mexico against the US.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, at which we proposed the fourth place, which would actually have been bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian fate judge who had allowed us to resume the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the man of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and fought the United States team, as at the time when they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
In this man, not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there because of a breakdown in 1990.
A man who may not have been the best about personalities, with whom we won a gold medal and who prepared us with great joy, was one of the pre-lympic tournaments 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitner as replacement for the disabled players because of the excitements of the Spanish games in Mar del Plata, we won against every forecast the gold medal.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculin.
And that he may take account of that which he hath striven in the land without his going about therein.
Who was the best trainer in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys, I like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you think is the best you've got in your relationship?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Mission from 1988 to 1995, covering the BSN from the 1990s to 17 men in one season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the sub-categories.
That boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet men from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the results of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, desk officials and judge.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my single children and get off and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoyed the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a homeless, domestic and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the olmagnat J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the 80's Habgier, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. to a new staff of "Dallas", died on Wednesday due to cancer complications, according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., manufacturer of "Dallas".
"Lary was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that most loved him," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the funeral.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas' hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all the joys he could.
He was creative, great, funny, intelligent, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived his life in full train," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cancer in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a bad tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years prior to "Dallas" the Hagman was known on television as a net type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the seatcom "Veezing Jeannie" of the NBC TV station.
There he played the Astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he hits an attractive "skin" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also the founder of two Comedys, which were only short-lived, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Her We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works include well-evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the most remarkable obscenity J.R., which made the Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television series on Ewing-Clan and other figures in its environment was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The statement "Who threw on J.R.?", which should create the expectation for an episode of full emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were written in lawhouses.
So the series achieved a visitor record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million visitors, the "Dallas" in the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million visitors.
It was Kristin, who had shot the weakling of J.R. (translated by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had made her weak and afraid to prove herself a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but there were other reasons for wanting to see her dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Eving as a corrupt, intranslatable man with a charismatic character: a persistent businessman and an abusive husband who then tried to expose his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to do on J.R.'s gravestone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "The Honorable Citizens J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, founder of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as a "great personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgettable and imperceptible for millions of reverencers in the world and remains with us who have the joy of knowing and loving him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success in the TNT TV channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second column was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
From Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the missing Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actor and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she met Larry during her marriage with law enforcement officer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theatres in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the air force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he learned about the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their own residence.
In 2001 he paid his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Number (and Absolute Truth) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything from which I thought it might harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press of his time.
After liver transplantation, he worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help prisoners.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are taking place and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some trust, for example, "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's going to be good for you."
He also took part in several campaigns against smoking.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Each week students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistencies: the end of the Maya calendar's "long return count" on December 21, many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect of him in the next two months: the destructive Hurrikan Sandy, who called some as "Deudarmagedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever happened," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers Campen University (New Jersey).
If a person analyzes what has happened in the world today, if we had been away from it for thirty days, that would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who should be the last in history to offer a course on the "End of the World".
In the temple, Professor Barry Vacker holds the course "Media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material was obtained into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the principal campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, formed a team with a qualified professor for art history and anthropology to offer a course with the bad name "The End of the World".
"We do not take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to stop the course again, for the fact that the world does not fall apart," said Restall.
Despite the "primary transition" students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final examination will be carried out on the pre-Apocalypse, why the students have no other chance than "to continue to work until night, where the world seems to go to the end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for high-level students, who filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails from students asking if they were still free.
The students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is of interest to the students.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religionality is actually just a matter of trust or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Weeksa for Psychology and Health Care explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I haven't heard anything from a teacher where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students asked - and less than one professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never said before the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in Western society there is apocalyptic fear, which leads back to centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prospect of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think otherwise," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "End of the World" there.
"The Philippines don't participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an emphasis on an exception to a higher court.
We have a curse from the pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been discussed by the Court of Justice, and said that when nothing happens on 21 December, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophy that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the end of the world came.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world."
"Maybe I call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
