Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The international biological group has concluded that the longest call animal is a Greenland polar shark that can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radio-carbon analysis of 28 Greenland coral reefs.
The largest shark, which is more than five feet [5 m] long, may be 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that the long-term role of sharks is a low metabolism that leads to slow development.
The summaries of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity by only 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that more than any callless animal was living in the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known as a scientist was almost 210 years old.

Can I go to the theater if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the Olga Godus.
What if a healthy person just quits his job, should he go to his room?
We need health care not only for treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under the conditions of the schedule, a person can check his body’s condition and receive the doctor’s recommendations for his life so that his health does not deteriorate.
No one will be deprived of such recommendations.
"Just stopping from work" is an important signal of the body, which must not be dismissed.
Constant stress, mental and physical overheating can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is 90 percent of the guests.
He was the most underprivileged man in the big cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to make the situation difficult and let yourself breathe.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people reduce their biological age while living in a room.
Modern tables offer comfortable rest for the entire family.
So if you want to take a vacation with the children, you don't have to stay with them.
For children, even the smallest, health programmes include diagnostic services, pedagogical advice, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many categories there are children's pools), inhalation, special diet mode, massages, oxygen cocktails, healing physics.
The course of the procedure is determined by a doctor, taking into account individual evidence and characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, children's clubs usually work with animators, where children can visit games, different master classes.
Some tables open their doors even for guests with young people, provide pregnant women with the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nurse.
The soft winter, long summer, the range of sun-days in the year (more than 300) creates good conditions for a round - the - clock rest at the Kwaxian Mining Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So there is no need to be afraid of windows, since most of the procedures are in the room and nothing depends on the season.
In general, systolic-curricular treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main Fiscal of the Caucasus Mining Water region, of course, the medical sources: Slovenianski, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
They have unique properties and influence on different systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, amount of sun, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor collects water depending on the patient's feelings.
Yes, Narzan has anti-immunordinary activity, restores the function of the iron-flying trachea and the exchange of substances.
Escentuki-4 is affected by the yellow-cool trachea, lowering the sugar level.
The New Essentuki is a counter-argument, iron and lead action.
They have the same effect as the Slavian water.
The condition of the heart-cooperative system is mandatory for the appointment of the doctor.
If there are signs of hypertension, it collects less salty water because salts retain moisture, which leads to increased pressure.
The use of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the required amount and at a specific temperature.
There are now various cosmetic procedures available for the person and the body.
What kind of healings based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be obtained at the resorts of the region?
Near Pitgörska, for example, there is a salty Lake of Tambukan, a salty lake that benefits the bodies, the telephones, the internal organs.
It provides anti-proliferation, dispersing, immunodulating action.
These are health gaps on individual-contained routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a large Kurut Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral source Narzan.
There you can also take baths of wines, vegetables, yodo-mouses, vegetables, salfino-calciums, depending on what your doctor will tell you.
Let's go ahead with the fruit.
What are you gonna do to make a walk to the end of the season?
She's talking about Julia Belopachov, the agronom and the princess.
The high-speed peaks of the bridge are to set up a string: pick up the new ones, cut the bags, remove all the leaves before the last oxygen with fruits and flowers with small bonds - they cannot be created.
All topics, regardless of the "constitution", as well as the prose and bacular subcarmelate with a golden superphosphate output, are processed by biopharmaceuticals (Adeer - for speeding up and growth of fruits, phytosporin-M, phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - from disease, Immunocytrophy - to improve immunity, Bitoxybicillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are injured).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer, only milk powder, colloidal cheese and green flour should be used.
We're doing the last field of plants.
In the heat, the evaporators drop from the heater so that the lower part of the tree (25-40 cm) is lying on the ground, drying the hot water and the solution of the zircon, covering the level of 5-7 cm of the compost.
It is also difficult to extend the fruit of the cup: cut the old leaves, pour hot water and solve the complex improvement, put down the fertile soil under the bone.
In order to protect from night colds, set over a thick layer of solid material.
On the day of growth, keep open and close after sunset.
End-marks.
What shows that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
The economists saw the signs of Russia's departure from the last twenty years of the recession.
According to Bloomberg's analysis, GDP shows positive dynamics, the second quarter of GDP decreased by 0.8 per cent per annum.
This is the minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to Russia's latest data, the fall in the Russian economy in the second quarter was 0.6 per cent.
The situation has also recently been stabilized by the Central Bank and the Ministries Development.
Before, it's a slow growth.
According to experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The index assessment of Russia's GDP says that the recession remains behind, and ahead of it is a slow growth of the economy," says the Bank of Russia "What the trends are talking about."
The modular assessment of GDP in the current quarter of regulators has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the assessment in the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of the Minéconomdation, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleaned drop of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter, the decline remained: it was 0.2 per cent in April, and the change in GDP was within 0 to 0.15 in May and June,” quoted MER RIA as "News".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters shows that it has been “closed”.
Among other markers pointing to the characterization of the national economy, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, business reviving.
If an adjustment is made to what is high in the year, it is understandable that the dynamics of more than 1 per cent of electricity consumption can be half caused by an additional working day.
Let's add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and the plus minus 0.5 per cent of the average can also explain the season," explains Cyril Jacobenko of ALOR BROKER.
In addition, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rostat has been thinking about deflating in the last two weeks.
The prices in Russia fell first in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble course, which, although showed strong curves at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since August of the year.
This is also one of the keys to recovery for real economy indicators," Yavonenko emphasized.
In addition, since April, the increase in industrial production has been observed in the RFF.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The external trade rate is reduced from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamics also demonstrate the labour market situation where unemployment has decreased to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favourable situation on the labour market, the issue of real income for the population is to be left to the best.
The figure is reduced by 4.8 per cent per annum.
This factor can slow economic recovery because household costs have little contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia could also be called a strict policy as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not best affecting the real sector.
The negative factor is also insufficient investment, which impedes industrial capacity development.
In general, however, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of decline in the RF economy is reduced to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says an analysis by GK Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The naturalization process of sportsmen, recently launched in the Russian football and highly experienced in winter sports in the Olympics in Soci, has not developed so actively in summer sports.
In the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and the former foreigners, in most cases there are priests of the former republic of the Soviet Union.
So in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - enough Russians are under the flag of other States.
In each case, the history of civilization is different.
Someone's parents had taken him to another country while he was still a child, not leaving the choice.
Someone did not hold on to competition for a place in the Russian Federation.
And someone thought that there would be a better environment for sport.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A 27-year-old girl wrote in a German passport named Lisa Ríjih.
But she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Over four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the parents of Lisa decided to immigrate in Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go to her older sister’s feet to take a easy athletic course.
Like her sister, Lisa chose a six-pound.
She'll stay in Russia if she can't "get away from the throne" Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Liza, Rio would be the only land we had ever seen in the six-year-olds sector.
Its best achievements in this type of sport are the 2010 European Championship and the serious continental predominance in 2016, which it once again pursued in the absence of Elena Sinbaev.
Elena Pirožkova was born in Novokuznecke in 1986.
Her parents were religious evangelists.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started getting involved in the fight at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where another former Russian Vladislav Isboinkov continued to operate at the U.S. Training Centre.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first impression.
That's why the champions are at peace in the same year - victory.
In the meantime, it has succeeded in winning the 2010 World Cup.
It was then the 2013 bronze and the 2014 Serb.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in the city of Yaroslavla, where she first met with synchronous sailing.
But saying that she was raised by our trainers in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to immigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado City.
There Maria continued her work.
She had recently joined the United States Assembly and had shown great results in the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, it cannot produce competition, but for America, its indicators are descendants.
A new name, which Russians have heard strangely, Christine Shaalbina was 11 years old when her parents decided to continue the training of a girl of artistic chemistry in the ocean.
Until then, the girl had a favorite sport in the family of Yaroslav.
Emigrant in the United States, she soon joined the youth assembly in that country, and later she joined the main national team.
At 19-year-old Kristen's Pan American Games, she was playing gold and silver.
The first position on the world scene was, of course, not going to fight, but for the United States, it organized this break - a star-pollutant gathering at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our ex-wife, Jan Berezco-Margrander, who speaks for Germany.
She was born in Tolita.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl was more likely to fall into the national congregation.
She had recently represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, of course, she was able to take only 17 places that were not enough to fall into the final confrontation in private.
So two years ago, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games -- young people.
Another gym, only this time Irina Sazonov.
If the migration routes mentioned above can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a teacher of the Volgograd sports school.
Of course, in Iceland she has become a champion country.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia - she is particularly visiting the family so as not to lose her skills.
In Rio she was not as successful as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in a personal multiplicity.
There are very little information about the Führer Maria Ugolque in the Russian Information Area.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it was under the Russian flag, showing the bad results - even the country's record was 200 metres away.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to speak under the white flag.
In Rio, its best expression is 14 places in a 4×100 complex.
In order to join the game, the girl launched a craudfanding project that enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that enabled her to pay for training in the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, carried out virtually all his career under the Russian flag.
Meanwhile, Professor Hasavurt was able to become a three-time champion of European champions, Russian champions, Russian sports teacher of the international class.
When he stopped going to our national assembly, it was time to think about changing civilization.
In a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports clubs.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won gold medals and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex- rosian, Mikhail Kudinov, the family is much less known than even the Swiss grandson of Maria Ugolkov.
It's because his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
That's where Michael started playing sports.
He did not achieve greater international success.
In Rio, his best score was 40 positions in parallel drills.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympic Games in sports is already broken.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was nine years old, her family had immigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her work on synchronous sailing, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a six-year-old girl took part in a synchronous swimming pool at the European Championships in Berlin.
In the debate with Eugenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eight seats.
It was the fifth in the solar program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croiter speaks for Israel.
When the boy was six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
By 2009, Dmitry had already become a country’s champion.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later Croyter also won the gold of the young Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the peaks, Dmitry is used for long-distance and three-pears.
31-year-old Albert was another teacher in Hasavirt, who, after long talks for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
In contrast, however, Albert chose Romania, which would also be represented in Rio.
In Russia, he even became a national champion in 2011 for the School of the Higher Sports Masters of Krasnoyarsk.
Oleg Antonov, 28 years old, was born in Moscow in the family of the SSC on the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
In a literal year before the birth of his son Yaroslav, he was recognized as the best volleyballist on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
At the same time, the family stayed in a permanent home.
In 2015, he became the national team's bronze champion of Europe, which was held in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and died with his family in the worst war.
Ten years later, parents decided to immigrate.
Norway had a significant goal, but in this northern country it failed - it had to move to France, Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the lead of peace among youth and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the fight tournament.
And once again the fight is free, and once again the former Russian.
This time there will be the celebration of the North Ossetia, which has immigrated to Spain, the Times of Freeway.
By the end of December 2012, he had been granted Spanish citizenship and is now serving as a collective member of the country.
Before that, it is true that 30-year-old athletes have been able to note high results in Russia.
He became a bronze champion in 2007 and 2008.
The Constitution of the Non-Discrimination in the Congregation, Timor-Leste, has decided to change the sport citizenship.
The last in our list is the Czech boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachkale, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents moved his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began to see his older brother as a boxer.
Since then, Arthur has been a Canadian champion, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Woman, she has a son.
Why do kids say classes at school?
According to Governor V. Condrateva, "it is said that we need to review not by actions and parades, but by the system."
They must grow up and at least seven years of age understand that they must be spoken and educated.
But as long as this work seems to me, it's going to be formal, and I suspect it's more on the books.
I'll be happy if the class members get all the positive things they've gathered before, at a quality new level.
If we don't know what the new idea is, it's going to be a dirty populism.
The JCC continues to remain one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There is a position for funds allocated to the needs of the communiqué from different levels of budgets.
According to the Genital Office, the higher rates are one of the most widespread crimes in the field of JHC.
As a result, more than 170 million rubs have been reimbursed by energy users in the region.
On days and in the province of Krasnodar, the facts of inclusion in unreasonably costs have been found.
At the cost of the IV-consulting OOO, 4 million rubs were placed on the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And that's the case on the side of the mass.
The people are paying for the "communal" of the last money that they pay correctly - according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the average number of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
It is immediately charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: expenditure, income legislation, abuse of authority, etc.
As a result, as the head of the fund, which was involved in the repair of the urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually carried out but was paid.
The businessmen just gave him a lot of money.
And as a U.K. manager, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay and spend it on his needs.
As a result of budget and housing damage, millions of rubles.
Macarov's machine scheme, eggs, typical for Russia.
The country experienced a wave of arrests and detentions by the heads of the United Nations, who took the money of citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial continued over A. Kohan, as well as the former MP of the Gorsvet, who was charged with 91.7 million rubs in machinery.
As a result, in 2012-2013, he established 6 management companies in Elizovo Kamchatski, and established three societies with limited responsibility.
One of them had done hard work for the UN, and two others had played the role of accounting centres, so money had been received from the population.
However, the A. Cohan didn't count on the money, but he spent it on himself, my dear.
It's hard to judge in the area of the HCH.
Things don't get excited, they're stuck.
And "helps" in this extremely corrupt housing legislation, it is thought to be Svetlan Desvorotnova, Executive Director of the NP "JKH Control".
We are unable to earn one law, as we think of a new one that must stop working for the past.
Specialists, including judges, are also small in the case of JCC.
Lawmakers themselves recognize that the right to housing in prisons is very little attention.
They also speak of the refusal of criminal proceedings, the shootings during the investigation, as well as in the Genoa District.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes committed in 2015, less than half were committed in court.
The rest of the investigation took a heavy toll and each fifth was suspended due to the absence of the accused person.
The shortcomings in the work of law enforcement agencies are often listed as gaps in the current legislation.
The law exists, but the authorities will not hesitate to encourage and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, some 230 charges were filed, with a total of 60 criminal cases.
In the five months of the current year, their number has only increased slightly to 99.
And what about the falsification of the housing protocol?
This means that changes in household management, financial and other matters will be addressed by owners.
This also means that no normal companies who want to work honestly and not to "give" the population can be broken down on the housing and communications services market.
It's found, housing in the mines, small and medium-sized businesses as well.
First of all, through the elimination of corruption as such in all States, Anton Jarkov, a member of the Committee on Property Affairs, was convinced.
And now this work is going on.
It's not just unilateral actions, it's a targeted course to combat corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a harsh situation.
In particular, in the capital scandals and it doesn't fall.
Why does Moscow not have such a scandal in the area of JHC, as in many other regions?
Since the capital government has expressed its iron will and order, Anatoly, a member of the Committee of the Gosdumas on Security and Anti-Corruption, told Aif.
I have a personal question, legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies have established port surveillance, and all of them have been licensed.
The complaints of the citizens are urgently resolved in public space (and housing treatment and response measures are placed at the Government of Moscow's portal).
Many not only pay monthly rents but also pay attention to how the house is kept.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow has verified the rationality of the tariffs for housing and communications services, as a small part of the budget goes into subsidies and benefits for many categories of people.
Probably all of this together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Is everything going to go wrong with the regional authorities?
Maybe you should change your place of work for free?
The Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan give up his friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Taiyip Erdogan appointed the Ultimatum of the United States, offering to make a choice between Turkey and Fethoullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher charged with the organization of government conversion.
He made a statement in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up their support to the “Terrorist organization of the Fetcullahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the gap between Turkey and the West is growing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"America is either early or late to choose between Turkey and FETO (the terrorist organization of the fetculists).
Either organizing the conversion of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," says the Anatolian Agency for the treatment of Erdogan, which was held in the middle of the evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey, however, had already strongly requested the United States to comply with his first request after the attack.
We recall that on the night of 16 July, Turkish military seniors in Turkey were seeking to force the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of the State.
However, after Rezep Erdogan spoke to the population, the killing was delayed and his organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, there were some 8,000 people suspected of being teachers and scientists, including soldiers.
According to Rajep Erdogan, their teacher, Fethulla Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., said:
The party also allowed Erdogan to interfere with the host community and to be directly American.
All claims in its address were investigated by refusing to issue Guilena and advised to change the tone.
The last statement made by the representatives of the Lords on this account was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg on the last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, who insists on his own and also imposes demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels calls the date of the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Minister of Turkey said on 9 August on EU affairs Omer Chelik.
He said that the introduction of Ankara to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would endanger Europe's own security.
Note that on August 1st, Germany's vice-president Zigmar Gabriell had forced Turkey to end the Euro Union's promise to open borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were the answer to the relevant statement of the head of the IMD of Turkey, Mevluta Chavoshoglu.
Another provocational statement made by Chavoshoglu in the short term allowed Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish MDG did not exclude the country from the alliance without the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign defence States to import rockets," Chavoshoglu said in an interview with Anadol.
According to him, Turkey now needs to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries, but we have not been satisfied with the results, and we have been looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this refers to the serious differences Turkey has with the West and the country ' s re-orientation in the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Eugene Minchenco, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a violent confrontation with the West.
It is very attached to the West and from a business point of view, and from a military point of view (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance the framework with the West.
Although, of course, Americans would like to see this post as a complete human being," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the Turkish leader's statements (on non-payment of EU compensation, on the demand for non-visual space with Europe and the release of Gulena from the United States) will be made.
“Rjep Erdogan is faced with the deterioration of relations with America and with the Euro-EU, which they will give to it on the humanitarian issue, on the dictatorial methods of country administration, and so on,” Minchenko believes.
The Head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change his point of view with regard to Russia as soon as it will be useful to him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very harsh position on Russia and in all ways sought prosperity in the West.
The situation has changed for a very short time.
I guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities for some time, no.
I think Erdogan entered the civil diplomacy period.
He'll try to get the maximum benefit for himself after the two Poles are in the West and Russia," he says.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain the political authority in the country, and for this reason Russia and its partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the US.
Turkey needs the EU, and the United States, which, with its assistance, controls the situation in Syria and in the Middle East.
The consensus with Turkey will therefore be reached," the expert believes.
Another point of view is the head of the Asia and the Middle East Centre of Anna Glazov.
The relationship between Turkey and the EU and the United States is now sufficiently tense, and this is primarily linked to internal policies that are being carried out by Erdogan personally.
I believe that this crisis will be compounded, and on the basis of this crisis, Turkish leadership will try to relaunch policies both in the Middle East and in Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have said that they are ready to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, which have been resolved with Israel, is in an active political relationship with Iran," IIF.ru Glazova explained that the next step would be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
In her statement, the policy currently under way by Erdogan is the return to the course of a foreign political concept that has been pursued by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolution.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in a very active way.
The very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been made.
That is why this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position both at the regional and international levels " - the expert believes.
The vote believes that the return of Turkey to previous relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, but it will now be more difficult for the EU to respond to Turkey, which can go to the borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young doctors' arrest: Call for new collective protests
The representatives of young doctors called on the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute on a new employment treaty.
The Youth Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to request its full Council to support more collective protests since September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to respond to issues of employment treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted in favour of canceling the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to "ly silent" on the issues that had led to the abolition of the employment treaty, as she said.
She said: “In view of the situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of the rejection of the proposed new employment treaty in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your issues”.
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC leader today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests, starting early in September.
The team contributed to the participation of young doctors in six exercises this year, including the first general exercises in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavana, withdrew after the vote to cancel the agreed terms of the contract of employment recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one, which should be accepted during the meetings before the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that this contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of Evils?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to raise their hands and declare the official end of eight-month war words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the courtyard in St. Petersburg, I had a constant impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was handcuffs, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's kiss looked attractive, and he barely got warm even on his own restraints.
Recep Taiyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good other" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their level of doctrine but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing had ever happened.
However, his enthusiasm suggested a return.
But the prolonged hunger from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the opening comments: Turkey became a Russian explorer at the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was wrong at the moment.
Mr. Putin became angry, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow behind.
It was even stronger, depending on what was expected.
Rehabilitation of real trust will be difficult and probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During the months controlled by the State, the SMEs have been conducting a shocking, thorough approach to Ankara.
It was suddenly shown that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious charges were that Mr. Erdogan's family was engaged in illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly rejected it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory for its species.
For Ankara the advantage of declaring peace is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost beaten up by his post last month when trying to change.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have made it very evident.
There is also economic reason.
Russian sanctions have been severely punished — particularly bans on hijackings that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The rate dropped almost 90 percent.
With regard to Russia, tourists and charity companies here, of course, feel relieved when the flights finally come back.
They put a peak end season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted more fruit and vegetables than the Turkish import of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, winters back here," said a report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because she thinks it's a weak response to an attempt to change.
Add to this her deep disappointment as she talks about EU accession and Mr. Putin's step — which seeks to exploit the cold and gradually destroy Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus ball with Ankara for the support of the elected authorities after a coup attempt.
Please note that this is a data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
Thus, the summit at this floating dock on the coast of the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce what one analyst described me as "the Alliance of Bads": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated in the West are united by forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently held itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps it is only for themselves that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch the subject.
The President of Turkey was intent on avoiding the response to their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey became a Russian reactive investigator, it is better that two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is missing for clients outside Scotland
The branch RBS shall be informed of the role of the branch office, as stated by the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to global bank ambitions.
The bank has abandoned them since he moved almost eight years ago and had to save.
In this period, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsoral assistance for international sport from Cuba from six countries on the way to the Wimbledon Andy Murray Championship.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to go to the first level.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all transfers to RBS, including the external headquarters and the fund-raising office, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are others, smaller brands for private banking services, which will have more influence on individuals such as Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed customers and staff in the Inverness.
He said to BBC Scotland: "The brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming the largest brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Now I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorial support for Cuba of six nations, and it will increase the profile of various brands in sport sponsorship.
"It's the right time for us to move a brand bank, as (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving a customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a remarkable bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of clients, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think it's the right time.
Franky Dettori comes to 3,000 winners winning in New York City
The children are breaking up the champagne after a double in New York City brings it to 3,000 wins.
Joke Franky Dettory won his 3,000 British win in New York on Friday.
He came to this remarkable note with the help of his second winner at night on his way home, to the Prestracy taught by John the Lord.
The 45-year-old Italian is a sixth-year-old who has reached this outstanding mark in smooth scales.
He's following Ser Gordon Richards, Dugo Smith, Lestor Piggott, Petham Idder and Willy Carson.
A three-time Dettore's football champion, who had won Ghyyar before, said, "That's something special."
I'm very free because my family is here too.
I'm so glad it happened in New York, just like I moved here 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a typical Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from a lot and very unsatisfied.
The children receive applause when the Presidency takes place after the victory
Two candidates arrived in shocks with obstacles: Richard Johnson's Master's Championship and the 20-year-old Ser Anthony Macko, who had more than 4300 winning a record career.
Lester Piggott, 9th Winner Derby, 4493 Wins in career
France is one of the best achievements of modern times, and it is not surprising that it has reached that conclusion that so many have reached it.
He's stylish and strong, but he's got his tactical scarring that's different from the others in the bathroom.
He is a great representative for jump, his enthusiasm and passion have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners, if it weren't just going out and big jumps!
And if it's serious, Franky has led the winners in Britain for most of the 30 years to see.
He's an energetic person who's good for British jumps, but more than that, he's incredible.
Franky Dettori has removed this exhilarating note from the company's passion for evil.
From intense to intense shocks, Franc Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It's been down and down.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his so-called "The Great Smere" in Ascote in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered from doping disability.
Three years ago, he began to face difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous courage to challenge the sceptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished at some point, the Children said earlier that he would like to continue participating in the meetings by at least 50 years of age.
Putin denouncing the head of the administration of Sergey Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dropped his head off the administration of Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of a trusted near Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed environmental and transport representative.
A statement from Kremla states that Putin “has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration,” but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanova's deputy from 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Wayne, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallin, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served in Tokyo.
He was later the head of the president ' s protocol and Government staff, reporting on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of administration is to support your work as Heads of State in developing draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented.
Putin informed a Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from that position and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are they convinced by the wolves?
It's a walk that's been handed over to Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest parties to Vladimra Putin and, like him, has served in the Security Council, the KGB.
As the head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who showed on public television, two men said that the head of the administration had gone away on his own.
But in spite of the camera caps, this little person has been convinced here — especially now — right before Parliamentary elections.
So, are these unexpected consequences of some kind of power struggle?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement — that the person for whom he had once been aggrieved as a potential president — immediately wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy — was met with great scepticism.
In Putin's comments on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me in this very difficult position, even if it could be said that the problem post was four years old.
Well, I've been the head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered the post in December 2011.
He had previously worked as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the Public Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the third term would contradict the Constitution.
However, this post was taken by another neighbor of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency after almost three and a half years.
The star of the series "Think as a criminal" Thomas Gibbson is released after the dragon with the promoter.
Gibson was a member of the show show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before it was announced.
There were creative differences of attitudes and differences of opinion.
I regret that this has happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's staff will be removed from the show followed by the FBI agent team is expected to be received later, according to statements of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously played a major role in the Darma and Greg's seat, was in the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Think as a criminal" and put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there by the end, but now it's impossible.
I just want to thank the stagers, the promoters, the actors, our remarkable team, and, most importantly, the best worshipers the show could only dream of.
It is noted that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Note: Fish landed in the Banfa garden
A man from Banfa called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be fish left dead.
Bane, a 500 - foot [500 m] seafarer, exposed this plant in Periscop, hoping that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-thirds of fish.
Quinsferri Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Faif
The project of 1.35 billion pounds is now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers joined the northern spring and the Quinsferri Crossing virus, which means that the bridge is now connected with Faif.
This is the first of the four interlockings between the windshields, which are now approaching the end of all three pillars of the bridge.
The Faif bridge section is now 600 meters long and has 30,000 tons.
It had 10,000 tons and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economics of Kit Brown has visited the area today and has been among the first to leave the country to the bridge.
He said: "It is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of Quinsferri Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering at a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the mass size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the mixing between the drain and the bridge floor is a virtual operation using extremely precise assembly permits.
In total, about 79 per cent of the entire bridge is now in place, and for the last section, the concrete covering is now in Rosaite, which means that everything is ready to land on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first drawing on each bridge project is always a significant angle.
This moving project represents the most modern construction experience.
After setting up the last section of the highway and connecting it with the expanding North Pole, we were then left to close the remaining view on the north — or on the side of the coast.
This was done by strengthening the northern approach of 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge operation at the same time.
The size is because a 222-metre-long vitae weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to a angle of approximately 3 per cent.
It was excellent because the permits on which the team was working were short - lived — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it's all gone very well.
Rescue in the Moelfr Valley: Three Men 'Away to Stay in Life'
Three men were forced to stay alive after they were expelled from the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was alarmed at 13:20 at the British summer on Friday, after the team saw the developments in the Moelfr River.
Three men outside the force tried to get to a safe place while their ship continued on its way.
"We've seen their ship circled around them and assumed they were embarrassed," said the roulette rescuer Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happy is the wind that carried him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved with the help of a local fishing vessel, and a third man aged 60 was found unable and trapped in a fight without a safe shelter.
All of them were taken on board the coastal lifeboat and transported to the rescue station.
Johns said: "Three men thrown into the water thought they were alive and completely innocent.
The ship's engine had an accident switch, but he somehow withdrew from the man who managed the boat when it broke.
Someone protected these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy cure for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children are no longer on the street to play, preferring to spend their free time on the screen, has been a source of concern to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go burns people from the divan and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was markedly limited by television, then video, and recently by smartphones.
So good to see that the technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I have, of course, in mind the main appeal of Pokémon Go, an application based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later the series of films, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural events, it all lost its relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was at that time delayed due to a massive challenge that was overloaded by the server.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
How does it work?
In two words, games with smartphones are going to look for Pokemons that are tracking through GPS and can be 'photographed' (through the screen on your phone) or 'remembered'.
The generation that played the game, as a youth, joined in the main appeal, leaving the divans to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of “normal” steps per day.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which is followed by 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people who followed them who had performed 30-minute exercises daily rose from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go, it just sees the first data on the transition.
Many health campaigns convinced people to find 30 minutes, to get up from the divan and to be active every day have not been answered, since most health messages are boring and people seem unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight adjustment, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the Pokémon Go flight is that it pushes people on the street to do what they like.
Thus, there are three health bases: movement, fresh air and sunlight and happiness.
Some people even make new friends on the streets.
As usual, there's bad business that's looking for what to ask for.
And yes, someone can knock on the door.
So what?
A break occurred.
Although the applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit, were able to monitor our physical activity earlier, they did not give us a reason for the way this game does.
The newspaper comes and uses will slow down over time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and health.

Simon Bayles wins the gold of the absolute lead in female gymnasium
Forget about pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bayles is vulnerable to all of this.
It's dynamic on the opposite angle.
Not forced on empty.
It's getting hot on the floor.
It's driving.
And now, finally, the Olympic Championship.
The 19-year-old American gymnasium was entitled to a campaign on absolute primacy in Thursday, placing a gap between itself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the auspices of the Olympics.
Her general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the Serbian medalist and company under the "Final Peterka" team, Eli Rysman and Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
Bayles from the United States holds a gymnasium at the end of a woman's individual absolute high school on the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth American women's tribe, winning the title of the absolute prime and fifth champion, at the same time strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps when it did not.
She was shocked when her final general ball and her long journey were over.
This achievement puts it in the same league as that of extremely rare lightballs, such as Michael Phillips, who took up their sports at new heights:
Bails spent the last three years in a sport, winning 15 medals of the World Championship, including 10 gold, with such horrid programs in their mix of work and accuracy that the 1984 Olympic Championship, Mary Lou Retton, called it “the greatest gym I've ever seen”.
One last test was in Brazil, not only between Bayles and the rest of the area, but also between it and the goods of the expected.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with the burning of gold medals would be considered an unfair expectation.
Simon Bayles from the United States, left, and Eli Rysman is buried after winning gold and silver, respectively, at the end of the woman's individual absolute first-person drama at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bills worked for the first gold on Tuesday, and became a beautiful final agreement for a long-term dinner with the coordinator of the national collection, Martha Carolie.
While Bills insisted that she never looked forward to the future during her long journey to the top, that's not the case.
Some of her free exercise programs — including her business pass — were set up in Latin American music, which would come right at home on the street just outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was trained by her grandmother and grandmother, beginning to walk with the child and opening up the mother of trainer Amy Burman during a visit to the room where Burman was a trainer, became strong.
She has not missed any competition on the absolute prime since 2013 — a field of transportation that must continue as long as Bills wishes.
Although Mustafin had a small advantage with two returns, it was peace.
Gymnastic and free exercise — where Bills defends the name of the champion of peace — are in practice.
She went up again with 15,433 on the left and ended with 15,933 on the ground.
Raysman softly caught her while waiting for a final account — a clean formality — and the tears appeared around the brilliant white and blue undercover for the eyes of Billes, when he invented what she had ever written in the album for the release.
Raisman's statement was a small place four years ago when it was a third place, but lost Mustafin's bronze on the Thames.
This time the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call a grandmother, was much ahead of him.
She sent a kiss to the crowd after her free exercise, which was sometimes mentioned in the matter.
With regard to Bills, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new significance:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer's case were shot during the hearing of music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who were killed in the first serial murder of Finix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stefani R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Mali, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the passageway, the authorities said.
The offender made about eight shots from the gun, standing by the passenger side of the car, after which he was placed on another vehicle, was reported.
The police claim that the three killings are not likely to be the result of theft, since the offender did not take a knife or $2,900 for one of the adult victims.
The representative of the Finix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting had caused investigators to check whether he had not been associated with the previous four attacks.
Seven people were killed and two others injured by nine attacks in two major Latin American areas over four months.
"It's happening in the living area before the house," said Howard KPHO, CBS at the beginning of this month.
The suspected use of several vehicles, including the former Nissan at the end of 1990, the black BMW at the end of 1990 and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The followers refused to disclose the evidence that the attacks were linked to one another and were committed to the same killer.
Ellis, in 33 C.E., was hospitalized with injuries and died later.
Linear, aged 31, and daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities have also published a report of the shooting police, which was intended to be an empty pickup for three hours before the murder and which, as they believe, was the case of a serial killer.
The tracers found the needles and pulled the bullet out of the seat and the pulse fragments from the motorbike.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalia: "I'll get better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixevto likes drinking, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of their peers, Edmond’s microcephalia is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know at the time of her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, ‘ I can’t do this. ’
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
Which, in fact, is not true, you're signing on it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, said that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical institution.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people would still do that," explained Pixivto.
Edmund's going with the Hoduns.
Edmund didn't sit down and he didn't get it until he got three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly going through some stages.
He's on the sidewalk and he's riding on a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and drinks.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund had in mind for "please kiss me."
"We teach his language of cruelty," said the Pixist CBS News.
But it is not just the common language of gestures, she says that Edmond has chosen his own gestures.
Microcephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmond, infections during pregnancy, such as cancer and Zika.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about what it's like to say about the lives of those who are infected with Zika's virus.
Pixisto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've always said what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she doesn't even know.
I didn't actually ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for the mother of children with inherited defects due to Zika.
It'll get better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana forced the governor to announce an emergency on Friday, with even more droughts expected to occur, including the state until Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the South Mississippi have come out of the coast and are threatened with widespread flooding after extreme droughts, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor Luizian John Bell Edwards stated that public officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already come to victims.
Mike Steel, representative of the Government ' s National Security and Emergency Response Office, stated that high water, boat and sand cargo applications were being made.
Steel said that only Tangjipoho's arrival requested tens of thousands of pieces of sand.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The Meteo-service stated that additional 3-5 holes could be moved into the area.
In southern Alabama, the drought was expected to occur until Friday, as the rain continued to reach the area of Mobil.
The Commission's River with Baton Rouge and the Emmitt River with Dane Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to set a record of the level of return in the past.
Synoptic Alex Crautmann said that the two rivers could cover many homes in the rural areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding coming down to Assenshen's arrival was a threat, as these floating rivers would slowly penetrate the Morp Island.
The Tikfo River, near the southern border of the Mississippi State of Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescuers still chased people out of the waters in the areas of Amyt and Wilkinson in the southwestern part of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his passengers were among those who were saved earlier on Friday at Gloster's train.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the Bever-Crick waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, are rapidly rising by night.
He said another passenger who lives nearby warned him.
"We were tired, and the water continued to follow," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my hair.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest storm she'd seen for 48 years living here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he was the only one able to swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and brought them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautman says that the flood is “fastly spread” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautman says that one observer on the ledge of Livingstone reported a 13.75 drop of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was overrun by raindrops from the environment.
The heavy rain and the destruction of the streets led to the rescue of residents from the entrance of Tangjipaho and the abolition of jobs in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that the Tanjipaho consultant reported 200 burned houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but now they are both burned.
The incoming President, Mr. Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The receptions were opened in the city of Emita and the city of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to disappear," he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tangjipahho, about two tenths of the streets were closed because of high water levels, and sandy bags were available for the distribution of residents in hopes that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major floods we had in March," said City Manager Lacy Landrum.
It's on the way to a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison district, Rupert Lacey, director of the Emergency Services Service, reported that the heavy rain continued to reach the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as buried on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Touson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Emita, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, and she's still flying on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "resolved with bullets" remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that in Philadelphia, a six-year-old boy was shot by a second shooting in a 6-year-old town this week.
The grandmother and grandchild identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
The grandmother and grandmother say, Brown got many shots, including his dog, leg, hand and life, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got very well, his little body was cut off by bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melandez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has had several operations.
The family told the station that it was expected to be repaired.
He was supposed to be in first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men was critical; two other victims were registered in a stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shooting at the front seat of the machine with a 29-year-old critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shot.
Follow-up reports to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a shooting between several armed people.
Several examples of semi-automatic weapons have been identified by the semi-automatic weapons.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous battle.
There were gloves on the street, on both sides of the tractor.
Therefore, the judge of all, there were a number of armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," reported the captain of the Philly Police Station, Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in this area were also occupied.
No arrests were made, and the police reported watching video surveillance cameras.
Another six-year-old girl, a girl, was shot in the arm of a wheelchair on Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's coming back, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call a woman's Olympic collection for this year's chemistry and for a few reasons.
First, I've been on every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasiums in this collection: Simon Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Laurent "Loury" Ernards, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Rysman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
It looks like America at last.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the number one was an African woman.
Last year Simon and Gabby were No.1 and No.2.
It's strong.
In the past Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could be a witness to the incredible statements of the three-time champions of the Mira Simona Bayles, Douglas and Lori Ernández, who perform unexpected but yet vertuous gymnasiums.
In fourth Simon became the fourth American poet who won the gold in the woman's individual absolute prize.
And a fellow in the congregation named Eli Rysman worked hard.
We're witnesses of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like that in the gyms all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form an Olympic Assembly.
They are a "final Friday" because the next Olympic Academy will have only four gymnasiums in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
But in fact, gymnasiums are expensive sports, and gymnasiums begin to be trained in private gymnasiums supported by parents who pay the cost of education, supplies, travel, form, attendance contributions, hotel services (for coaches and their gyms and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasium clubs are located in rich residential areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasiums get everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term responsibility for the gymnasiums.
Amy Burman, coach Simon Bails, and Maggie Hanni, trainer Lori Ernards, both trained their athletes from the time they took up high school.
We need to create a more cost-effective and accessible exercise for communities of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gym 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and cheap gymnasiums in Harlem for more than 15,000 young urban children (mainly black and Latin Americans) and trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide a high-quality youth gymnasium that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability for the insular work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This association has had a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout life.
That is, the inspiration of this gathering will send thousands of girls to the gymnasium, and that is wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a remarkable time.
Thank you, Simone, Ellie, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning the Olympic gold team and for encouraging so many girls from different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors have taken the announcement of further arrests following the rejection of Jeremy Hunta's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the change by agreeing to the amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to enter into this treaty, saying that NHS was on the ground and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first young doctors have been transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in working hours at night and in order to improve out-of-time care.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Young Doctors" BMA, said yesterday in a statement: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that he is questioning the current labour crisis and that he cannot apply to all doctors in a fair manner."
It was eight weeks before the first group of doctors was to be transferred to a new contract, necessary progress and time to start.
The WMA's attempt to resolve negotiations was met with a reluctance to take action and sometimes with full silence from the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the threat of young doctors.
If he does not do so, young doctors are convinced that they are ready to organize the following exercises.
The last meeting ended at the end of April drew a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 meds, while nurses and consultants were invited to replace doctors on the pictorial line.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute on change by agreeing with the amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants to pay better for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employees, called on young doctors not to continue to panic.
Mortimer said: "The traumas reach little or nothing but pressure on those who already work at the command and services, causing anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, seats and their families."
Over the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of Young Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and Others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
It was hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning after a break in the career, cost of education, mutual recognition of the educational plan, academic leave and gender differences in pay for medical work, was a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were meeting the conditions reached by WHO in November, February and May.
2 £ a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are collected using 2 £ a day after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-dispersive preparation of thiagrelor reduces the risk of repeated approaches to people with heart disease.
Preparations have already been prescribed for 12 months after heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or new approach.
The NICE National Health Service of Great Britain advised its people for four years to keep out of the risk of heart-to-heart problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of Great Britain has now advised its people for four years to continue to address the risk of heart-to-heart problems.
The heart rate is approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and four more approaches or strokes occur.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of the blisters.
If the blister is broken down, this may be the cause of a thrombosis blocking the access to the heart and causing the heart attack.
And if the tumor moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the bleeding into the brain, causing the insulin.
People who have already reached one approach are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name of Brilique reduces the risk of causing a drop in traffic.
The NICE project, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of cygrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the existence of effective methods of secondary prevention with about four people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating effects.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of follow-up heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In advance, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of thiagrelor — particularly the risk of bleeding — has been limited for three years, the draft instructions do not recommend treatment beyond that time limit.
The culture of PK's ownership allows for the falsification of vote in Muslim areas
Mr. Tauer Hamlets Lutforr Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving the Government's comprehensive report
The culture of political adjustment has led to the closure of the eye, which has been reflected in the widespread falsification of the vote in Muslim communities, according to the devastating report of the Government that has been discovered today.
Former member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Sir Eric Piclas, was critical of the police, electoral observers and city administration for ignoring the testimony of electoral violations due to “extraordinary sensitivity to racial identity and religion”.
The former Secretary of the local community, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the threat of electors on religious grounds was so strong that the police had to allow the border to be placed outside electoral sites to protect the vulnerable voters.
He suggests that the electors take the identity certificate to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, the voters should only specify their name and address.
The report even proposes to place unsolicited blacks on the hands of people when they hand over their ballots with a view to eradicating them from being able to vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to informants, said Sir Erik.
He invited the press to have greater access to the documents of the local council and decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes from its hands,” he said.
The report was ordered by the Dahn Street as a result of a scandal with a vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Court on Elections decided that Mr. Lufur Rahman should be removed from office in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had “expressed the religious feelings of his Muslim community” and had forced him to hide his criticisms by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it has been said, "has come to his campaign on the basis of the responsibility of the Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were cast, or were the result of a person's vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular fears about the e-mail vote in which the senior members of the Muslim community, as reported, were forced to vote for their elected candidate.
Sir Eric, on the photograph, made several recommendations for the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to provide his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, was presented to vote in favour of older people, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
“There was a fear that... the public institutions were blind to such conduct because of the excessive awareness of “political justice” about ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations on cleaning the system, including the removal of political activists from work with postal ballots to stop the "crowding of votes".
The report also calls for serious checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to provide confirmation of identity before the vote.
Use the unwelcome blacks on people's fingers, as long as they're throwing their pens to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of people in order to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail vote.
Eliminate political actors and activists from working with completed ballots and interpreters with post-vote votes.
The authority of the police to set up border lines around the electoral areas.
Amendment of the Act to facilitate the prosecution of persons in fear under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Make illegal photographs at electoral sites.
To require only English to be used in electoral locations (with the exception of Wales).
Enforce training to ensure that staff are able to go to one place after another.
Sir Eric was furiously attacked by the city police, saying that it was “precious” that no criminal charges had been filed after the Tauer Hamlets case.
“The Court, which dealt with the issue of elections, disqualified Lutforura Rahman and his agent for a long list of acts of corruption and illegality”, he said.
He was found guilty of the lack of reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of evidence — for a number of reasons.
It also criticises the unsolicited "circulation of gala" of electoral offices of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: " Last year's decision of the court in Tauir Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our nation has a high heritage as the mother of Parliamentary elections, and yet the worrying and hidden distribution of electoral fraud and the status of rejection by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Similar skills to Kate's bikes and other Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic Fantas in Rio this week went with the wisdom of the French biker Polin Ferran-Prevo, who, as it turned out, seemed to look like the hierzo of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only athlete fighting for the gold this summer, which can be praised by his own well-known double — at least in summary messages.
So, in honor of Game Rio and all the prominent people on our screens at the moment, the FEC has made a list of Olympics that have more than the surface similarity with the Hollywood stars.
Ochotnik and Volk: U.S. male team member Brady Ellison, left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's bicycle driver, many people online have been able to show how a certain trailer could be near the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. male team of athletes, Brady Ellison, became the cause of hurricanes in Twitter, after the images of him appeared as scary as the Wall Street star.
And in fact, the painter knew of the folly of the censorship and admitted that he had heard that he was like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a great similarity, perhaps except for face growth," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
In one of the most popular comparisons from London 2012, it will no doubt show even more in this year: the apparent similarity between British-principal Greg Deserford and the popular actor Nilo Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnasium Ali Mustafin, with its big expressive eyes, is said to be a precise copy of the Cuban-American poet Gloria Stefan.
And in the Basin of South Africa, Cameron Van der Burga has been compared to Man Matthew Morrison's star for many years.
Turning to more unexpected: The user considers Nathan to be a "sport version" of the "Start" actor
Another long-standing comparison was between the tennisist Raphael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could be hit by similar heavy loads and losses.
A silver medalist sailor from Russia, Julia Efimova, can be praised not only by the hot skin and bright hair as Annaline McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, is like "a sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
Sorrow women: The Hoop Solo Football Star, the left, and Jennifer Carpenter's actress from Dexter, in fact, have the same shapes and faces
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Building theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that this couple is based on the same appearance
One Twitter user recently called to the site to find out that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical".
In fact, U.S. Football stars and Dexter actresses have an amazingly similar shape of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her kiss, which is close to the identity of the actress Lori Linni, as well as the winning gold medal of Gabby Douglas, which can be admired by his own beautiful wide kiss, which resembles the sweetest of the "Doubt Success" star Gabriel Union.
The commentary on the Olympics on the CBC apologizes for saying that the Chinese tribe "died like a pig"
Analys Byron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14th-year-old Yianhanh at the women's estaphite free-style 4x200 m moved in the middle of CBC viewers in the Olympics.
The Canadian intelligence company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that 14-year-old Chinese hunters “started like a fire” and “dead as a pig” during the flood.
Commentary Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female stylus 4x200 m free.
It could be heard that McDonald, who was brought to CBC's commentary team to "scream her colour," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese has wiped out the sword, child."
She was too liberal, she started out like a fire, she died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China's 14-year-old Ai Janhan, the second stage of the estaphetate at 1:57.79, was 1.61 seconds longer than Canadian Taylor Rock, allowing Canadians to withdraw from China.
Observers throughout Canada responded quickly to the network after the tone and expression had been used
Emmet McFarlein tweeted: "Did the dictator CBC say that 14-year-olds from China died as a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize that they were still in hell."
About Ai Janhanh from China at the end of the female estafetate 4x200 m free-style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has been throwing a sword, child."
Criticism in Twitter quickly broke out on Biron McDonald, and many called for it to be fired.
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how uncomfortable Biron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradez, wrote: 'Nothing #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of growers. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who had been handed over by the CBC, apologized in a direct ephere for the comments made by McDonald, saying: "We are sorry that the comment on the epher was made on the ephere."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words, we're sorry that happened.
The SVS concluded that more than 90 people had apologized in response to this statement
A friend of the commentator, Scott Russell, had to apologize from McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologys to more than 90 other Twitter users who had appealed to McDonald's comments.
The television also made an apology and made a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to enter the Effrey.
Yesterday evening, we acted urgently to apologize to our viewers in the direct ephere and our signatures in the camps.
In other words, the comments made by Bajron were about the expression of the nephew rather than his identity.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Beiron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in a direct ephere and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words were interpreted as personal assaults.
'I would like to use the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's estabette,' he said on the transition of the Olympic Games to CBC.
'I talked about the expression of the thief, not her personal.'
'I only understand that no disrespect was understood, and I'm very sorry.'
Buyer Primark offended a woman who had consistently shown lower whites in the store
The buyers did not know where to take a look when a woman was forced to wear a shirt, along with the stores in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she showed them how she looked, stood them up, and put them back on the ground.
She continued her search and eventually died four times lower whites in the shop of Bouverie Place, Volkston.
Primark Store of Bouverie Place Trade Center in Folkston, where a woman used triangular trains before placing them back on the ground
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the store, said that after the example of the lower white forgett woman again, she “went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, “The people could not believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the shopping room, she took a pair of quits, pulled her own shoes, and turned them over.
"She didn't try to find a beautiful place to do it, she just stood there, naked."
"They all stopped when she pulled the shirt back, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the ground."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she wanted, she went away again.
"It doesn't look like she's worried about who's watching her or thinking about the person who's buying those tricks that she's been following."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's opposite to thinking that someone's going to take a home trip that someone's already carried, and they haven't been taken care of."
The event took place on Tuesday.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left, so it was better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's trolls and find out that another woman had taken them away and they weren't visited."
The representative of Primark reported: " Primark knows what happened in our store in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August".
All the goods concerned were excavated from sale.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a sword
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help you to make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mirzraci, the master of the Federation of Crab-Maga in New York to explain how to deal with armed robberyers in close proximity.
Whether they come before you or behind you, this video will show you how to kill a man who is armed with his own weapons.
If they go back, according to the Mizrachi, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you hold the gun firmly between your thumb and your thumb, before you hit them in the face with a free lock.
Then you should put your knee in the sand, and as long as the attacker is injured, you draw a gun out of his hand, put it in his face, and go back and hold the weapon on him.
For an armed front, the way to execute the like is to get your body out of the fire, quickly catch the gun and pull it out so that the thieves can't shoot.
At the same time, move the gun, and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his pocket, before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Mirraci does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery, if you're not a master of war, is to give up your things.
Traveller Jan Reitt is conducting his language at the worst places in Europe
The British traveler has been subjected to his immune system and the spinal reflux of a serious trial, putting some of Europe's most ugly and disgusting places.
The lead author and author of the travel book Jan Reit, 51, from Saffolka, conducted the euro bank language, the Pirka Piccadili Pearls, the unitary button on the trip and the Russian public phone to prove the power of its immune system.
Before each object was moved, he used a lampmeter to show himself and us what he was going into.
But the experiment to become a film called the Guide of the Traveller-Lisun in the Internal Force gave some surprising results.
In fact, there are even worse bacteria in the kitchen kitchen.
Over the course of his journey to Europe, he talked to doctors and staff about the increase in oxygen bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing in the envelope has brought him more than a bad taste in the flesh.
Reit became famous for the tests on the size of his suitcase, the journey of peace, and the arrival of strange and wonderful things.
From the public bells to the buttons, this task must have tested its immune system.
In a film he filmed, he said, "From childhood, I was totally concerned about my health, and I wore a lot of different things in my mouth from the ground, eating red and drinking water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the Russian public toilet.
His sample mask showed the value of a lamp greater than 4,000 units.
For comparisons: only the hands that have been pulled must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to bend, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the stretched hands showed less than 60.
Rite and Finnish milk producer Valio filmed a travel film called "Trouble-Lisun Traveller's Guide on the Internal Force", showing the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet.
He said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've ever seen in the toilet."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to pull anything because it's boring.
The Guide of the Traveller-Lisun on Internal Force was withdrawn along with the Finnish producer of Valio milk products.
The company has provided Raito Valio Gefilus, which contains oxymolic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human oxygen bacteria and develop the immune system.
The senior Vice-President of Valio on cuisine, juices and new categories, Niko Vourenmaa, said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brain tumor that ended the idea of "let me call Jan."
They claim that the health of the bottle becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to place them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the kitchen health and how it is related to the immune system.
A growing interest in the health of the bottle is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information on it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of honor!
Tom Hakkala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's say that I would lose respect for Yana if he took some of the things I asked for, for example, the disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier to wear than others, and some were tough enough.
I'm glad some of these changes have made us sleep on the plane.
During a 2015 study conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated cyclomoleic bacteria exclusively with the good condition of the refrigerator and the kitchen, and 58 per cent said that they used, at least occasionally, products containing added oxymolelic bacteria.
The families of the Hulligans destroyed Saltsa, the municipal house of Cornuol, forcing them to leave
The Hulligan family left their municipal home with $50,000 lost after they were raised to scare their neighbors.
Tanu Skeldon and her partner, Sean Treblinka, were expelled from their property in Saltsa, Cornuol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced up from the real estate facility, the shocked housing cooperatives discovered that the real estate facility was in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with swirling walls, half were raised, the wall was split apart by sex, and the walls were filled with graphite.
The family is now moving and is expected to live in a private room
Donna McEvoy, a resident of Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be brought up because this object of immutableity will probably be known as a very good aspect of Cornelius.
This family is used with stupid praise, and their name is with stupid praise.
A couple of three children living in a time of instability, and the police report that the horror of the family’s family’s kingdom included street fires with baseball bats, the threat of the inhabitants of nearby areas, the use of drugs, drug trafficking, excessive screams, disputes and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial conduct in June.
In a few rooms, the house that might have been torn apart, there was an old bridge.
Sex records in a house where drugs were sold in the past were discarded
Neighbors say they saw dragons on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing had forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary leave.
The relief visit was welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into a total waste.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived with them for 20 years, and that was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is amazing.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighborhood Group, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years with the police and regularly called the police.
Moses and the old toys were broken down below the wall of the municipal house
He added: 'This is the impression that the lessor was unable to accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, such as the expulsion, is always the latest method of action that Cornwall Housing reviews.
This was a very difficult case, as conduct was limited, and their actions must have been terrible for her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to provide us with information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be acceptable.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived at home at different times, but he said they all had a little more than 20.
Green matrice left on the floor in one of the burning houses after the eviction
Local workers will now have to pick up the breast of the mouse that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of copper, as well as the relevant assets and £1700 available.
Skeldon was convicted after recognizing himself guilty of drug possession in Class B for supply.
She said that money went to pay for the funeral for her son, Li Skeledon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After making them homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partners are now living in Plimute.
The walls of many rooms were packed with graphs all over the area.
The police say they will try to expel tenants who are not subject to rent rules.
Angela Crou, from Devon and Cornwall police, stated that this visit had sent a clear warning to other contractors who continue to break the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel that they can do it without charge, and for those who do it harm," she said.
Crime and antisocial behaviour will never be permitted by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a flying military plane was barely able to cross the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, the sun - god tourists were terrified of their lives
Aeroplanes P-3C Orion Air Force Portugal Aeroplane is incredibly low
Military air forces reported that they had carried out a training flight but were at risk of safety
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start panicking, while when the slower plane jumped over the crowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen on the Dramatic Frames, flying almost nowhere from the docks to the sand field in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Breathing on their feet, as if they had been worried about you for some reason, but they had no chance of seeing what was moving on their side through the clouds.
An incident happened last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa-Novo.
Daniel Fernández, one of the few breathers who published a shocking video of the fall in social networks, said: "He flew at least two times, and there was a moment, it was shown to be broken."
Nuno Arroja added, "I used to swear and swear, it felt like a plane would fall on me."
Travelers on the Aveiro beach were terrified when a plane appeared from a plane and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force has said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft has carried out a training flight in order to detect fishing vessels on the coast and has been forced to land so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the plane had flew a little lower than usual because of the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby tropical forests, but the military air forces claimed that no one was at risk.
By this summer, forest fires had damaged the mother’s part of Portugal and had claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's military air forces have made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low under conditions — a heavy fire and power from forest fires that damaged visibility
The flight was completed by a pilot, and the pilot was ordered to discover fishing vessels within the scope of the task
The HASP system has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of the coffee and restaurants of Petersburg have not yet entered into it.
The checks are getting more active, and the business's taxing up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hasard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of the HASCP) - the risk analysis and critical control points - are mandatory for the use of food producers and carriers as well as companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
The inspection of the business by Rosso-Turf in accordance with these rules in Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, while officials are writing taxes only for certain violations of the regulation (see "List of documents").
In general, the failure of the regulation has led to 600 thousand rubles for the first infringement and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASCP as a system that takes into account the risks of food and prevention in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food security for the astronauts.
The system is now being used for all food business not only in the United States but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, the PSC has been operating on the TS territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years (HASCP demand was reflected in the TS TS framework in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
We have, unfortunately, been convinced for a long time that the rule applies only to food products, not restaurants, to the head of the General Council, Elena Creetelli.
Now everyone's trying to get lost.
The waiting period for the return of the hives to Turkey - the end of August - began September.
But they won't challenge food demand, as their target audition - families with children - are already ready for school, experts have noticed.
The Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government yesterday, asking that the driver be allowed to leave.
“For many Russian tourists, the choice of quality and availability of marine air is impossible, as most of the facilities are already banned by the end of September in the resorts of Krasnodar and the Republic of Crimea,” the authors note and stress that opening in August does not have a significant impact on the demand for the Russian maritime product.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Federation of Tourism (RST), where Russian and Turkish aviation agencies are rapidly in agreement, it may be expected that the re-examination of scheduled flights to Turkey will take place within a month.
The concept of re-establishment of helicopters until it is not available depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if tourist operators are operationally establishing programmes and agree with the shipping companies," says Paul Rumyancev, Deputy Communications Director and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, it is possible that the reinstatement of drivers is good news, but does not have too much impact on the market, since the main buyers of children and children are already returning home and ready for school or leave in other countries.
In the barhoat season, tourists are bought mainly by private travelers and couples.
The charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to breathe spontaneously," says Paul Romans.
"There is a chance in Turkey to attract many tourists if it is now receiving very budget proposals - 50 to 60 thousand rubles for a tour on two, because there are people who are looking forward to a very decent tour," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel.
In another case, it is not right to count on food - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul also believes that since there is a demand for regular journeys in Turkey, tents will also be exhausted, but it is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey, the start of teasing now is the rehearsal of the next season," says Paul Rumyancev.
"The opening of tents in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," according to Valeria Rubzov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFF from the provisions of the legislation of compensation payments under approved rules relating to the reimbursement of damage caused by education or other health damage.
In the case of workers employed under the conditions of employment, milk is provided for under Article 222 TC RF.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of issue are set out by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers on the day of actual employment at work with working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at work.
In accordance with those rules, the Russian Federation concluded in its letter that, on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of paragraph 217 of the RFF, income from the NDFF is exempt from the value of milk issued to workers on the day of actual employment in working conditions under the Standards and conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Ministry of Justice of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
The Moscow Gastroybank has been unlicensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a licence to perform bank operations in the credit organization of the GAZSTROYBANK Business Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, AOCB "GASTROYBANK" has conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the deposit of money in low-quality assets.
The adequate assessment of the risks accepted by the supervisory authority and the reliable exposure of bank assets provided the basis for the credit organization to implement banking prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank has been appointed by the temporary administration until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The mandate of the executive bodies of the credit organization is suspended under federal law.
OO AKB "GASTROYBANK" is a member of the investment insurance system.
We recall that the payment of insurance to banknoters, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ, "The insurance of the contributions of natural persons to the banks of the Russian Federation" is made up of 100 per cent of the remaining funds, but not more than 1.4 million of the total.
Payments, according to the Investment Insurance Agency, shall start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, on 1 August 2016 ACOB’s assets were 335 positions in the RF’s bank system.
London School, which joined the IGIL, died in Syria
Katiza Sultan, one of three British schools who left London last year to join the IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundji stated that her family had learned about her death in Rakke, Syria a few weeks ago.
It is estimated that it has died from a Russian air strike in Rakke, the country's cluster area, as reported in the ITV News on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died as soon as she was planning to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this - as a funeral and a pledge to others, that is, the risks of going to a military action zone - is to convince people ever to make the same choice," Akundji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schools from eastern London were on a plane in Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family told Sultan that she had been married to an IGIL warrior in Syria and had been a widow for several months.
Reid states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court post in case of election
The leader of Democrats in Senate, Harry Reed, says he is convinced that a democratic candidate in President Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected as President.
The people of the Senate blocked the approval of Garland, and as President Barak Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority in Senate, Mitch McConnell, said that the next president would elect the person who would be able to replace the last Judge of Supreme Court, Antonina Skalia.
Reid said at the fourth call conference that he predicted that Clinton would select the Garland "some degree of confidence".
The representative of Reid said later that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether he would take the Garland away, and simply built the assumption.
He commended Harland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "fuck the boat" with a new election.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeal for Colombia.
Reid stated that the Republicans blocking the appointment of the Garland were "repudiation" and "qualified" of the Republican candidate in the presidential office of Donald Trampa.
He stated that the tramp was not suitable for the post.
Treats states that horotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The Traats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release in the light of the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
However, they are intended to find the next generation of fuel models for their 2017 calendar with the registered museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his journal is different from the old-style Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to return to the exhibition of an eternal and classicalized image, where women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman’s body,” said Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
Women would like to be part of this project because it is an excellent art production.
Models can be taken online or personally on open casinos in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be reminiscent of inadequate internet stores.
In Moscow, a memorial will be issued that will tell you how not to become a victim of the Internet store.
This was reported in the Rosso-True Manager, M24.
It is reported that departmental experts are preparing a memory that will help citizens to choose the Internet properly and identify possible mask schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides for a number of sections.
These will be common information and a legal basis, rules of delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how the claim should be properly made and so on."
The memory is being prepared for this moment.
It will then be placed on the Moscow Rospotemsor website, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and distribute it to the Mosquitos.
The IMD of Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of the division in Crimea.
Persons from the citizens of Ukraine and Russia have been detained, contributing to the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them is Pannov Evgeny Alexander and Zahtey Andrey Romanovic.
“They all give thanks,” says the report.
Former residents of the Zaporas area, Evgeni Panov, who had been detained for questioning in the organization of the tractors in Kramou, admitted his guilt for questioning.
The FAS describes Google on 438 million rubles.
The Russian Anti-Fraud Service (FAS) has appointed an administrative fee for Google Corporation of 438 million rubs, which is on the board website.
" Google's tax for violating anti-dumping legislation amounted to 438 million rubs.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay taxes in the near future," said Deputy FAS leader Alexei Dozenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google is sending smartphones to producers who are sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play applications store only provided that other corporate applications will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search system to be located on the main screen of the smartphone.
As a result, the corporation violates paragraph 1 of paragraph 10 of the FC “On the protection of competition” (misuse of dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the requirements will allow for the development of competition on the market of the mobile PPO in Russia, which is well spoken of by our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be followed by all companies that are produced in the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including the Russian Federation, " - the head of the Office for Communications and Information Technology Management of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The court suspects 16 Russian stores.
The "New Book" network was critical of the sale of the book "50 days before my suicide."
The "New Book" magazine network is designed to sell the book St. Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports the city news agency Moscow.
As reported in the Rosso-Urator, without clarifying the amount of the fine, the text may be considered as “promotional or motivating to the sexual behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The residual regional court confirmed the breach of the requirements for the dissemination of information products among children and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the printed product arrested by the Rospotreb Supervisor.
The source of the New Book confirmed that this was about Stes Kramer's production.
In March of that year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores carried out checks on the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
There will be a night in Moscow to remember Ernst Unknown.
In Moscow, night will be remembered by the sculptor Ernesta Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will be held on 15 August at the Central Library.
Unfortunately, not all will be able to get along with the stranger in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to replace it on their own land," said the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
There they noted that this was important to the widow of the artist Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
At night, close friends of the Unknown, including poet Evgen Evtuschenko, artist Boris Messerer, chairman of the GMII. Puskina Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovski, and Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinski, head of the Cultural Department of Moscow Alexander Kibovski, Vice-President of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
It was previously reported that Ernesta's relatives were planning to make a panicide for a sculptor in New York, probably until 14 August.
The final consumer blames: Who actually buys plastics?
The only men in the middle of the year love wine.
And until you have tried to confuse the section of comments with serious complaints under the pseudonyms of the MedianLetts, this claim is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussed return of plastic is due, not to a bum among the generation of two-months who want to discover a novel material but to the fate of the middle years.
Those who have recently purchased a wine album c for a large proportion of the probability are from 45 to 54 years of age, according to data.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18-24-year-old group are at least likely.
It is also not just a collection of lovers - it is emotionally important: older buyers are more likely to maintain their feelings (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and enjoy unity (69 per cent versus 66 per cent).
But are youGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me until I went to the center of the alive streets of Soho, dressed in a humble dress and sneezing in front of the stop, holding hands and saying, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly losing its charm and gregariousness — clothing, coffee, papercase stores have now filled buildings, sometimes occupied by independent sellers — several musical shops with fantastic specialists are still left.
I would probably ask the camera to stay for the next scene, where I would be close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional moods with the help of observation.
Stourt's cousin, 55, whom I sent from Sister Ray (data from two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data from eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably 20 years old), in London on Sunday for a meeting, and spent several hours in stores.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plastics.
These plastics above (he sent me an e-mail photo, I didn't chase him home), are coming along the walls of his guest.
His reason for acquiring such a large number of albums and songs is partly due to his income: he can now buy plastics that he could not afford when they went out and buy items he had sold when he was young and on a mile.
"Many of what I'm getting is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, things that came up when I had 11s or 12s for which I probably was too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics, most likely, are introverts that like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my lack.
Uz, who works at Sister Ray for 25 years, also believes that many clients he meets are according to yourGov profile.
However, he noted a new wave of people under the influence of noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy their old plastics.
The trial of the talks that I had had left my collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who have ever sold their wine to buy compact discs now sell their compact discs to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain the cause of a certain age among the respondent.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
It's enough to spend a couple of seconds in the store, such as Phonica, to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society for people with similar views.
According to Washington, some older clients, in particular, are disturbed by an endless system of payments.
Some lovers of guilt may feel disappointed in the digital world and prefer to keep away from the constant shifts for plastics that provoke memories of youthlessness.
"I think it may sometimes be filling the void or having material things as a sort of comfort," says Uz.
Just like I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to get your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the warehouse.
The ICM survey in April showed that nearly 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not listened to it.
The request also found that 41 per cent of those who bought the vineyard are not in use, while 7 per cent of those who buy the vineyard are not in possession of the plastic player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be seriously disappointed with the Bolsanov collection.
The "Trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old, works in Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone came recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plastic so we can put it in our pocket," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely happening.
It's more creative, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
These are younger people, not older, less than twenty who know only that.
Fopp, who has now taken almost all the blame, is a lot more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who have 70 tourists photographing boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less forced than in the above-mentioned stores, the latest Sint and Sexy Wild Beest, rather than jazz improvisation, is passed through the columns, it is pleasant to see the variety in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish the position of 30 seconds with someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various plastics available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't work much, she says, so collecting plastics is not a very suitable option.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but beauty is..." - It's in a dream with love filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really non-repetition.
My last stop is a store, which, as they say, has contributed to the appearance of a new generation of lovers of guilt: urban fashions.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at the gender-related shorts, I'm watching the group of teenage girls, every minute in the area of the Polaroid camera, before the father and his daughter begin to discuss the purchase of the player Crossley.
On the left is a wall set up by Adele, Jeff Bacley, Amy Wynnhouse and Flytwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory plastics for any medium collection.
No one will look — perhaps because they are simply a trap, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to trap them.
It's this "dangerous vinil".
However, given that any attracting attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to Soho deeper for some time, almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the share of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than the share of the majority is the share that spends most of the money on larger items, as he has done.
But while my conclusions show that youGov is accurate, at least in Soho plastic stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of female collectors and offenders who actually exist in plastic stores and online forums.
These people probably work at school or offices.
But they clearly do not perform on the fourth day, passing through the stock market in Bervik-Street, passing through the plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader, who is above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark — the longest call animal — videotape
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life span of all calls on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record has set a smack of 272 to 512 years and a length of five meters.
The French court rejects the proposal to set up a store in the Jungley refugee camp
The French court rejected the proposal of the Kale authorities to destroy dozens of self-employed stores and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial hearings this week, the Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to install 72 self-employed stores, where people in the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer or sell tea for 50 cents (40 r) or a simple blue for several euros in self-employed restaurants.
The Kale Prefecture stated that these places should be destroyed because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they are at risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that stores and restaurants are vitally necessary, stating that the free leaves proposed by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of food in the camp.
They said that self-sustained stores and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to exclude people who owned 72 self-employed stores, but stated that the problems of Kale Prefecture were “to be fully understood”.
Judge Jean-France Molla said that the bakers, coffees and restaurants played a far greater role than the craziness of people who “live in extreme shocks”.
He said that the spaces provided a peaceful meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the tsunami was the Children's Coffee of the Book of Jungle in the camp, which was not working for the benefit of the camp, offering 200 meals a day, in English and French, and advice to provide shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect children's coffee.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that his closure would be “an accident for these children, some of whom are not eight years old”.
Two charitable agencies, the Relief of Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungle camp increased and increased by 9,000 people — the highest in all history — after the sharp increase of the new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-regions libraries invite young people to get to know programmes.
This week the libraries will hold meetings on the City Day, the Year of the Russian Film and even the Physical Day.

Brittany stays on the regbi-7 after master-class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive British series in Regbi-7 was severely halted at the final opposition of the Fijian team to the final on Thursday evening when they were completely disintegrated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Figgies gave master-class control of sword, dispersion, detonation, support of game, escape of line and rough force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The strike was not too poor in the form of beer, the third in Britain per day, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regby-7, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The disease of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could be returned to have a negative impact on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji won the best team of 15 people in this form.
This may be some comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one British wears a gold medal tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimblellton.
It was a trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost everything.
These wounds will cause pain, but progress will be positive.
The Fijians started a great, fun attempt to conquer the Great Britain's attempt to conquer the sword.
It was like getting on a bus stop for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinsau jumped into the corner.
Four minutes in time, Jerry Tuwa added another score on the right flag that was realized.
12-0 and Great Britain barely got to the sword.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell held up a man named Leon Nakarauu to kill a third, but this only held Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jassa Veremalwa made a dotdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the repetition and for hours there was still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then passed through a few more great attempts to capture Britain, and the storm took a line to get the eye.
The implementation led to 29-0 interruptions.
It seemed that Fiji would be born for the game in Regbi-7, while Britain still has a rifle.
What's really important is that.
Great Britain has made mass exchanges in half the game, and they've bought the Fijian bomb for all four minutes, which was good for the first half until Joshua Tusova passed after several exciting fissiones.
Dan Norton realized the temptation for Britain, made a score in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but a long time ago he was on the way to the South Sea Islands, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the tribunes.
It was impossible to be completely happy with Fiji's approach.
Matta William was attracted by the fictional cake that he didn't need in the drying, another attempt in the last seconds.
He sounded a bell, the Fijians drowned, and the Great Britain fell on the scene, completely out of place.
Earlier that day Fiji won Japan from 20 to 5 in its semi-finals, and Britain had little in common with South Africa in the forced semi-finals of each — the differential of Britain.
Kyle Brown's got Boxes in front of the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work, broke his leg and killed himself in the second half.
The last recent attempt by Marcus Watson, a brother of the 15th side of the English team, Anthony, has won — and in the end, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning were inspired to win the battle against cancer
It won't be any more fun gold on these games, and that's what they're talking about.
From the first to the last, 220 heavy earthquakes in history, Helen Glover and Hiser Stenging found their golden moments at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who were wearing the vests, there were three votes in this boat, the former coach Robin Williams was always trying to reach the second Olympic gold class in women's pairs, the first women in British sports ring who had won before that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unassailable, once again unprecedented.
As we see, two shining sportsmen on the surface with elegant lebedes do not fully reflect the nature of the triumpha.
For every gold, the battalion of the ready arms, which contributed to the gradual growing gains that were important, did not have hands that were more important than the hands of a trainer 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would survive before he could see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had breast cancer, which is one of what they can do, and they did it.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That could be a bad situation.
It changes your looks a little bit in the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio agreed that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the intersessional, maintaining a minimum graph, if that could be a proper expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed a paycheck, so I needed a quick fix.
That was encouraging.
I was in the hospital and played at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per hour, although there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The back itself is a journey, but it makes her a little bit more.
The following thought after their victory was about Williams, who had been nervous in the morning, speaking more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the Artillery Corps Service in Afghanistan, said, "I've been emotionally disabled this week, maybe it's a bit of a shock, but it means so much."
It's just confirming how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't even ask for a better partner for training or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning didn't miss a race in five years.
This pair creates a tense rhythm for which their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 yards [500 m] when New Zealand and Denmark's troops began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything boring.
We didn't expect firemen today, we were just hoping that we could make a good mistake and get out and win this race that we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover must be at the wedding next month, on her own with a television searcher, Steve Becksholm.
Now she just wants to enjoy it for a moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so excited.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the time limit for the destruction of sanctions
The Government extended by the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of food prohibited from imports into Russia.
The relevant decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who was published at the official Legal Information portal.
Embargo was introduced into our country in August 2014 with regard to countries that imposed anti-virus sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, and it is now operating until 31 December 2017.
In Russia, imports of certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, fruit, fruit and milk production were prohibited.
The use of food imported into the country in the context of the embargo is taking place in Russia from August 2015.
Only about 100 tonnes of prohibited products have been released for the first quarter of 2016.
"Brand's Oyster"
In Moscow on Friday, rain and hail are expected.
Through the capital region, an atmosphere front will be passed, which will bring down and lower air temperature.
The air temperature is 25 degrees Fahrenheit [- 25 ° C].
Yes, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be a short-term rain, possible storms and windfalls up to 15 m/s.
The weather is expected to rise from 12-17 m/s to 12 m/s.
The weather is also forecast in the Orlov, Kurt and Voronej areas, reporting on Dni.ru.
The next working week is small.
The WTO Arbitrary Panel found that Russian imports to the library, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import duties exceed the obligations of Russia upon entry into the WTO.
"This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against the FIF," says a communication on the organization's official website.
However, the arbitral tribunal stressed in its conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were “systematic” or “wide”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt imports to the book and refrigerators in the near future.
This is discussed in the report of the Minoronomic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
That is what the Government of Ukraine said.
In May the Financial Times wrote that the conduct of the United States in resolving the issue in WTO would undermine the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the Euro-Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of Americans to approve the second term of South Korean Judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not be referred to the WTO on Western sanctions imposed against the RFF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President ' s administration changed the leadership
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the head of his own administration of former deputy, Sergey Ivanov Anton Vain.
Vladimir Putin withdrew from the president's administration and expressed his hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and Krammel.
In turn, at the meeting, Anton Vaino stated that he considered the important anti-corruption work that he had begun to take place under the leadership of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
In the past, it was stated that the experts considered that Sergei Ivanov ' s resignation from the position of head of the administration of transparency and understanding would not substantially change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the manager, who has been working in the administration of the President for a long time, has effectively demonstrated the activities of the AP.
Instead, the deputy head of the administration of Anton Vaino - a man who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they're not going to buy fuel at the Gasproma.
The Polish company PGNIG does not exclude that, over several years, gas supply from the RF could become unacceptable to it because of the re-orientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company Boluslav Magez.
His word is TASS.
"It can happen that we won't buy gas at all, we're now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply directions for us will be East, a commodity from the SPG terminals and Norway," Majec said.
The Gasprom is currently in the dominant position in gas supplies in Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 placed nearly 5.3 billion cubic m of gas at 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of Russian gas giants in PGNIG purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
We recall that on 22 July, the Polish Anti-Fraud Office did not agree to the creation of a joint Gasproma company and its European partners on the construction of the North Stream-2 pipeline.
Earlier this month, Poland had left a request for Gaspromu for 11 billion cubic centimetres of gas per North flow-2.
The Vice-President of the Dutch Government, Alexander Medvedev, made this statement.
The North River-2 auction will be held in 2017 and the auction will be planned on its board in June 2016.
At the end of May it was reported that the Gasprom had not yet planned to take action in relation to the intention of the Polish party to withdraw from long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, the Vice-President of the government of the company Alexander Medvedev said.
He recalled that in the I quarter of this year, only Poland increased 42% of the gas supply from the RF.
Before Gasproma, he added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG made a statement in the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean that negotiations will be terminated.
Earlier, the Polish company had referred to the court to obtain a lower purchase price on Russian gas.
Remember, the authorized Government of Poland on the gas and energy infrastructure of Peter Niimski reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gaspromo.
The Polish contract with Gaspromo was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on the gas and energy infrastructure of Peter Niimski stated that his country could refuse the supply of deep fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of frozen natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will unite the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
The North River-2 provides for the construction of two tidal gas pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic m of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the OSCE has increased the number of observers around Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first Ukraine M.M.A. Alexander Hugh.
"I can confirm that SMEs have increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant issue of journalists, "REA News".
According to the OSCE, the situation on the Ukraine and Crimean borders is peaceful, incidents affecting security have not been identified.
Observers followed the three crossings through the Russian-Ukraine border.

The CP took place at 4.30 p.m. in Moscow.
Reys of KrasAvia's airline came from Soci.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where they were not injured.
They were just transporting the aircraft to the station.
Ufy Airport works in normal mode.
The air traffic investigation of the CPC has been identified as a reason for the heavy landing of a passenger plane.
The United Nations will investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission will investigate the possible use of toxic gas in the occupied areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides of the conflict reject the use of chlorine, but the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Stefan de Mistura considers the fact that has happened to be irreconcilable.
Such statements called for the launch of the third round of inter-serior negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched a study on reports on the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Alelipo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then claimed that in the area where the threat of a Russian military transport helicopter had been dropped, the aircraft dropped bombs with explosives, but in Moscow the charges were called explosives.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the former opposition group " Harakit Nour din Az-Zinki".
Soon it became known that two bombs were started with toxic gas.
This confirmed BBC one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the fire began to burn my eyes, and it was hard to learn," quote the reader's publication.
As a result of the attack, at least seven people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of exhaust gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be considered as war crimes.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, told journalists: "The evidence that has really happened is a lot."
The Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CFC) states that the use of chlorine for military purposes is prohibited.
Although all sides of the Syrian conflict have rejected the use of toxic gases, in 2015 the human rights defenders had established 35 cases of the use of the Syrian army's chlorine against the “mortal opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the day-to-day bombings in its areas, and terrorists hinder the completion of the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humane pause” in military action.
The current three-time strike regime in the organization is considered “not enough to help nearly 2 million peaceful citizens who have been trapped”.
The Stafhan de Mistura on Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egelan, stated that 48 hours of fire would be needed to provide assistance and evacuation of sick and injured people every week.
"We have to send large quantities of goods from colonial cargo to places where roads are practically destroyed and what are left," Mr. Egelan said. "But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humane break” continue.
How Russia opened the "gumantar windows" in Aleppo.
Under the continuing struggle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, announced on 11 August the introduction of a three-time cease-war regime, which will start every day from Thursday.
The establishment of the “humane window” has been designed to provide conditions for the supply of medicines, food and essential items to the city.
The decision of the IMF was adopted on the basis of the strengthening international pressure on Moscow, with a request for the return of the military operation and for the renewal of the negotiating process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the streets of Thailand, four people were killed.
Suddenly, several explosions broke out in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attacks, four people were killed, 19 injured.
The explosion epicenter came to the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were 10 foreigners, four nationals, and no Russians were among them.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any terrorist groups, but the country's MDG has been speeding up the claim that Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been arrested, suspected in the bombing organization.
The preliminary data of the local police, the size and specificity of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in Phuket and Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of the military gun to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors of development.
By 2016, 14 million people had been visited in the country, with 1.5 million more indicators in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attack have already been detained, reported by Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
As soon as he spoke of the objectives, he added, however, in the MDGs, “it is believed that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
Too early to make conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any form of terrorism, in fact, these are local differences, and we are trying to establish the identity of those behind them.
The explosions took place on the day the Queen of Thailand was born.
The Thai Hunta considers the protection of monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is almost directed against it.
According to statements by the General of the Police of the City of Shrizopacharoenrate, the bombs were fired from a distance of half-hour time.
They were dragged inside trees on live streets filled with tourists eating in restaurants.
It is well known that one of the four victims became a Chinese girl who was trading street eggs.
The remains of the victims are still unknown, but they are known to be the inhabitants of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Police of Thailand, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and Austrian citizens.
The Russian bomb victim was not reported by the Rosturism Press Service.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the last 7 August referendum, with 61.4% of the country ' s population supporting the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Commission for the Development of a Constitution designated by the Military Guantánamo.
The voter had to be determined whether they supported the system in which the House of Commons was fully appointed as soldiers and had a significant role in the election of the prime minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be first tested in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military conversion took place in Thailand under the leadership of the command of the country’s commander, Prauta Ocha.
In that way, he said, the army had led to an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced the time of command and censorship, disseminating protestors and the top of the House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in an emergency situation
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yingla Chinavat, announced in January 2014 that the situation in Bangkok and the capitals of the provinces would be affected.
The special regime has been extended for 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the Bangkok Centre in the monument of the Victory, where one of the main acts of protest occurred, resulting in 28 people being hit by five of them in critical conditions.
The explosions caused unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have intensified security measures in the capital and have attracted military forces to the protection of demonstrators.
In Suho Loge, conditions began to develop.
As is known, the Government is proposed to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the Sukha Log with two key constraints.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25 per cent and more are owned by foreigners and those who are not at least 25 per cent of the guests.
The industry did not expect the Government to sign the terms, noting that many games were not in danger of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
The Minpreds submitted to the Government a draft order and auction conditions for the largest unexploded gold settlement in the Sukho Log (Irkutsk Region, stock and resources - 130 million units), two sources of "E", known as the situation.
The project introduced in the middle of the evening is one of them.
In Minprerod it was confirmed that the project was submitted to the Government.
A representative of the curative non-use of Vice-President Alexander Chloponin said "Y" that the project had not yet arrived in the civil servant's equipment.
"The auctions may be announced in August, immediately after the Government's departure, and the time limit for the gathering of potential participants (at least 45 days) tenders may be already in October," Minprerod said.
According to the data "E", two key requirements for potential participants were maintained in the project, described in the option, which was agreed by the ministries and the FOIVAs in July (i.e. " . " . " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
First, there are at least 25 per cent of the bidders' capital.
The second is the refusal to access auctions for foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already stated on 2 August, the auctions may not be allowed by companies whose profits (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the FF or have dual citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Suhai Log refers to the federal value of more than 50 tons of gold.
In Minprerod it was confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on details prior to the Government's administration.
The need for participation in the capital of the auctions was raised by the Irkutsk region, speaking in December 2015 in Minprerod and subsequently confirmed the governor of the region of Sergei Levcenko, noting that it was sent to Minprerod, his predecessor, Sergey Eroštenko, "with an investment agreement with Rosteho".
Anyone who's lobbying restrictions on the admission of foreigners, "E" colleagues don't explain.
"But in the spirit of time: not to give control to the largest gold settlement in Russia on the basis of Western sanctions," "E," said the speaker, who was well-trained.
The head of Minprerode Sergei Donsk stated on 1 August that foreigners could "go to the Consortium", if the claimants would attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The "E" colleagues consider it unlikely that the government would correct the conditions.
The main president of the Suha Log in the industry is the Consortium of the largest gold dealer of the RF PAO "Polus", the under-control son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rosteh".
As he wrote, in July partners created SL Zoloto, where P.L.P. 51% in Paulus, R.T.G.-49% in R.T.G. structure.
Rostehe rejected comments, in Paulse, that "Y" was clearly interested in this asset and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and form of our participation will be taken after the conditions have been announced," they added, "Paul".
The auction may take part in ALROSA, but a decision by the Government of the RF said "E".
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotke, expressed no interest in the ability to participate in the development of the Suhogo Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data "E", are not interested in the assets.
The head of the Union of Gold Industry RF Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 assessed "E" investments in Sukhai Log at $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential claimants are not only afraid of investment, but also of the complexity of the project: a serious stock survey and the technology of work with complex redheads explain "E" in the industry.
The biggest M&A transaction in the pension market, the ICT Finance Pension Administrator, launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, the Gazfund Pensions Fund will be established with a total of approximately 373 billion rubs.
On the launch of the four pension funds merger procedure - KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Follow-up and Gasfund Pensions Fund - yesterday the owner of 100 per cent of the OOO Fund reported to KIT Finance Pension Administrator.
“Reorganization is carried out in accordance with the CB's requirements for non-compliance with the terms of existing treaties”, stated the company’s communication.
The Association is based on the Gasfund Pensions Fund.
As noted by NPF Director Oleg Belarus, the Foundation's association has been able to address a number of challenges: increasing the geographicality of presence, focusing on development resources, reducing costs, maintaining best practices for each fund and optimisation of corporate governance.
According to him, the reference period for the end of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the GASF, the GAS Fund will become the biggest player in the OPS market.
According to data dated 31 March, the total pensions of the combined funds exceeded 373 billion rubs.
As reported on the Fund's website, its owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, is currently Anatoly Gavirilenko (65 per cent of the OO is controlled) and the Gazfund NF (35 per cent).
However, only a group of competitors were left behind.
Yes, the O1 Sub-Control Group of the Future NPF has already seized the Stalfund in the beginning of the current year.
At present, the combined NFF is joining the Uralsib and the Russian standard funds.
“Union in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural challenges,” notes NPF Director Nikolai Sidorov.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also to be carried out in the Safmar pension group -- the "European", "Definance and Science" and "Regionfund" to the Safmar NAF by the end of the current year.
In 2017, it will be joined by the "Doorie" NPF.
“Union of funds will contribute to increased control of risks, operational processes and costs”, noted in the Safmar pension group.
The pause in the pool of funds held by the KIT Finance Pension Administrator may have been suggested by experts for a number of reasons.
Until recently, NAF could not acquire more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure obligations in which the group was actively placed.
Following amendments to the CB Regulation in March of this year to a number of issuers that meet the regulatory requirements, such restrictions are no longer applicable.
If necessary, all output can be purchased by one major game,” says the Director of the AKRA financial institutions rating team Yuri Noging.
Several NFF leaders from the 15th floor on assets for another possible reason call the impact area division and, as a result, the individual appointments in the single fund, which were to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavirilenko was not available for comments.
They didn't answer the call "Y" at the Gazfund NPF.
While the consolidation of funds is a work and non-profit activity, this decision will be justified on a long-term basis.
As Mr. Sergey Okolesov, director of the Pension Partner Advisory Company, notes that the "Gazfonda Pension Savings" is less costly, the accession will allow for the stabilization of the base of other funds of the group.
A more successful experience will be developed by NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofonda" in the construction of various ODA sales, as well as the use of a more modern OPP.
The requirements of the CB for processes and the NFF framework are constantly growing, so that the infrastructure on four funds is duplicated in a single investment policy, which is considered inappropriate by the managing director of the corporate ratings of the "expert RA" by Paul Mitrofanov.
" The effect on the reduction of double functions will significantly reduce the possible costs of integration," said Mr. Mitrophynov.
The combined costs of the four Sergey Ocolesov funds are estimated at 30-50 million rubs.
“The cost of the four funds of this amount is approximately 400 million rubs per year, with the consolidation of the medium-term perspective, the budget is actually reduced by two," said Mr. Okolesnov.
The Russian proket had the best disembowel movie "Piet and his dragon".
The beautiful New Zealand, the gentle dragon, the soul - searching story, and the song in the corner enough to re-believe in ancient magic is thought to be ELENA CRAVCUN.
The frightened young man picked up the dragon, who became a human child and a meek one, and another betrayed.
Pete calls his friend Elliott, and in honour of a poem from the book, he plays with him in the dogonal and buried in the tomb.
Six years later, he grew up and married, no longer being different from the other man-made forest-sorvant Maugley.
In such a way, Pita and her brother, her husband, was aggressively exploiting the forest, aggressively exploiting the forest.
Now she has to believe not only in the existence of the dragon but also in helping to save it.
Pete's a quick "to be human" course in the neighborhood of the idyllic Americans who wear quips, a moral code in the heart and taste more subtle than any advertising.
No one looks or acts too terrible to see him now beginning to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who had been exposed to the indiscriminate host of wildfires, was far from correct.
The huge smoker dragon has also been found to be unafraid, with a good sailor, a winged wings and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon has fun, he's hungry, he's hungry, he's hungry, and he doesn't even talk about it, so he's always trying to relax, and he's quite different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manoeuvre provide such a high level of emotional involvement that, at the most urgent moments, they start to throw despair into three hands, not only small viewers but also adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley in Pete's role between the possible family and this one.
And Robert Redford's virtually handing out a conical grandmother who would like to have literally every child.
How did Director David Lourey manage to remove the fantastic love atmosphere of the 1977 dragon Pitt film, from the nose to the end of the chaos and just remembered the mix of animations and games, and make it the most heart movie this summer?
Not how the miracle helped.
In his painting, Loury from the original, in fact, took only two things: the poor Pete and the dragon.
The ship has remained the music numbers and most of the country's trails.
In this good story, we read the drawings from Mumbai, Inoplantian and many other beautiful children's hearts.
The study of Disney continues to make it a success to expand the gallery of the 21st century high-quality courses.
Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't as beautiful as the Young People's Book, and it doesn't have an experienced theft, as Kate Blanchett did in the role of the cat in the new Zulshka.
But this innovative film helps us to believe in miracles and good in better design traditions.
Kstati, the keys to the wooden lock Disne registrant Louri will get again - for the artistic adaptation of the history of Peter Pene.
David Lourey's "Piet and his dragon" Tandem, and Senator Toby Helbrox, came to a new ambitious project on non-progressive boy by James Barry.
CRC journalist Alexander Sokolov makes a new accusation
Lawyers of the RBC, Alexander Socolov, accused of the organization of the activities of the extremist structure, stated that the prosecution had found some shortcomings in their defence.
We learned from the investigators that the prosecutor had made such a statement yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court meeting on the limitation of information on criminal matters, but the meeting was not yet held, and our investigators informed us of the prosecutor's submission.”
She said that the prosecution had indicated to the investigators that it did not meet the qualifications of the case and the collected material.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and bring Alexander Sokolov a new charge.
The second article of the Criminal Code (WC) will either appear in the case or remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Denze will explain.
As reported by "E", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the result had been excluded from the accusation of a journalist of the RBC in the form of a “political situation on the part of instability” and an “unlawful violation of authority”.
ALEXANDR ZILIBERT, a member of the Kommersantóboscosport, lived the life of the Olympic Olympics in the Olympics, inspected the house of a Russian collection, won the local table and even passed the WADA test after that.
Life here doesn't seem to die for a second.
Even at night.
The last start is after midnight, after which the athletes need another half-to-two hour to return to the Olympics.
In addition, villages and villages are forced to leave the village without delay, as some athletes finish their talks and leave Brazil, and others, on the contrary, only come here.
Well, at 7:30 a.m. in one of the temporary attempts, the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be held.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational domestic issues - the leader of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igorh Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our houses were located is considered exemplary, it was one of the first to be used and demonstrated to all the verifiers, even in the case of an accident.
It's a hot water problem, so, sorry, it's a unita.
We fought for the sake of cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to pick it up.
And then the clinics came, but they're just looking for some substance on the ground, yes.
They have a field, you see, some innovative.
I can't get them human.
Let's know these fields are laminate!
In general, changes have been made to the client company, and now all of this is OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Boutovo, a sleeping area surrounded by cities, with others, with narrow streets, pools of water.
Well, there is still a two-metre rail line, which is being driven by automobiles.
Up to 17,000 people can be placed in 3604 apartments located in 31 homes.
One of the 18th-century buildings is covered by a huge Russian flag — this house is completely abandoned as needed by our collection.
Given the small fire at the entrance, it is possible to determine immediately what problems appear to be the most serious for the family team.
At the end of the registration, there are two ads: the printed "Pasaluista, don't blow a book in a toilet!" and from the hand "First in a gift sign.
It's just a stay that's stuck in your pockets.
Their happy development contrasts with the headings of the brochure: “The Memory of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro”, “The First Assistance in Indigestion, Individual Disorders in Breathal Paths, Loss of Awareness - Phases of Heart-Responsibility”, “First Assistance in Respiratory, Heat, Transfusion and Blood Disorders”.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, it says: "Infection is accompanied by ligoracic and follow-up treatment.
However, a favorable outcome awaits not everyone.
Of course, there is a medical centre in Russia, which at any time is ready to provide qualified assistance to the household, including a weakened and sportful mass.
On the contrary, the centre itself is the headquarters of our delegation.
A row with a door is an inspiring cry, "No matter what we win!"
Well, of course:
All the arguments are absolute!
Only he who fears will believe in them.
Let us down, so the taste of victory, Russia won't give up, it won't break!
And for a further increase in the spirit is the proclamation: "Dear Brothers and Sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and of all Russian Kirilla, the Olympics of the Russian Federation have been provided with spiritual assurance by the prosecutors of Andrey Vladimirovic Alexeev.
You can order a prayer and other demands on your phone...
In general, there is a Center for Media and Religious Affairs in the village for representatives of all conferences.
Well, growth is achieved in a privileged position - they have their own time.
With regard to the load of elevators from the ninth stage on the fourth floor, I have decided to land on the table, which is recommended to be used during fire.
And in the dark there was about her body lying on it.
It was, of course, the sleeping staff of the new client company.
I believe that at any time they were ready to blow on the edge of innovative sex, they decided to set up a quiet time right on cold stairs.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a former famous Vitali Fedorovic Dubko, a coach of our Battistas who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He, along with the European champion Jan Paul, agreed to show his rooms.
We live on two, blood, of course, almost nothing, but it's not critical.
One on four, but that's why it's spacious.
The scaffold, of course, is funny, out of the bag, it doesn't call for trust, but something can be done.
"No, you're complaining that they're out of tea!" said the tennisist Svetlan Kuznezova, who met me at the main table.
It is called the main, however, because it represents 2.7,000 square miles and is ready to accommodate 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are up to 60,000 holes in the bag completely free of charge.
The following menu options are: "Best Brazil", "Courne Peace", "Asian Blues" and "Die, Macaron products".
The last option I've seen is a lot of popularity in our volleyballs.
Besides, I'm saying, I didn't find any of the giant restaurant units.
- What kind of soup?
It's good that I've been caught by Chinese.
And a tea.
But in general, to understand, we've got even worse food on the map.
There's something you can choose, despite the unexplained unity.
I've personally chosen a couple and a haircut in a tomato sauce.
A table with each leaf is available in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as with the food value of the product and its availability of alleles.
Well, that's enough, to admit, it's been a coincidence.
I don't even know why this place is always at McDonald's.
We can say "hot" sportsmen out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA).
They're subduing the boat - a Victorian winner with a football match.
They're exaggerating, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, it must be answered properly even if eight out of ten questions were to be answered.
There's questions in Russian! - A woman from WADA attacked me.
But not on that attack.
That's what I'm doing in a patriotial crash, of course.
The situation was already underway on the second question: "If I have received notice of a doping check, should I go to the doping control point immediately?"
I stopped at option B: "I don't have an hour."
He's lost, so to speak, caution.
I forgot that WADA's weaknesses are not expected.
In general, it has to be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the Victorian situation, my situation became quite critical.
I thought that if I would find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my flat chart (and I can get it hard!), I can use biofuels to get "additional nutrients to improve my productivity".
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is expressed in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but in a number of proposals it responds.
It's not fair to play WADA!
How's it going, Russia?
To leave somewhere behind Efamov, Isinbaeva and all our hidden command.
That is why I focused and won the most unfortunate football.
Know what they're talking about, ours!
In a winning mood, I took it to the fitness center next door.
Get involved with coaching.
It's 250.
Surprisingly, he noted that no Russian sportsman had found the escape route.
But maybe that's right?
Let him who does not play be trained!
And here's one of our boy's seats in a couple of clinics.
I'm going to college.
Don't worry, not a gun.
At the police station, as well as around the forest where the plague hits us, we're looking for a condom.
And upon him is a call from the rising of the sun, saying, "Exalted with the sun."
Only the rails that remember the hand of the door lock and the container made of the natural lattice of the Amazon are ready to be released from the apparatus.
I took myself alone, to memory.
The athletes won't be shocked. They've got 450 thousand.
There is a full entertainment centre for the holiday and holiday time in the Olympic Forest.
In any case, there is a well-known table, which reminds the International Olympic Committee that it spends $3.25 million a day in various ways on sports.
The centre is called video, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices that look like video coaches.
That's what it is? - I'm interested in the company in the form of a Ukrainian collection, which is actively using a dicanic game.
I could, of course, just say that you don't want to talk to a man in the form of Russia, yes.
Here, in some strange way, things in the eyes are fished from a baby in a yellow-black.
It's the most playing collection.
To cover the entire village, looking at each corner of it, it takes at least three hours.
But if you are going to go and not build the electricians, you are also opened a Canadian home with a lot of wool and linen with refurbishment van, and a cheap office, a washing machine, a fireplace, a parking lot, and a color shop, and a washing machine with everyday goods, and mail with unique brands (only you cannot at all be able to transfer from Chinese philosophers), the bank, and the office of finding, and the photograph.
And later in the evening, you will sit down in the shade of an olive tree bearing various leaves in the memory of friends and relatives who left this world.
And you'll be in the company of a machine that's constantly blowing fluids to kill people, thinking of eternity.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
Until the rest of the Russian world was inspired, as the Australians had almost never punished the American Dream Team, these patients went into the network.
Little one knows: the news that Inna Derigalsov won the gold in the rapper at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I'm even the only mosque who saw how this happened - without considering who saw the encounter in Carioca that night.
This can only be understood by this patient.
Here's a big Moscow night.
Neighbors down - like always nighttime - are falling and getting really bad, but it's very hard to shout at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
On the kitchen floor, there is no time to sit on the market and buy as a sandwich, a new one.
There's nothing understandable in the television schedule, so he just kept track of the Match, First and in any case Russia, although it's almost pointless.
"Rossia" is a family of repeats, the whole sport is there for something in the records.
There's a series going straight into the ephere.
Hope, of course, at "Match" -- a young man's entire evening shouting in news releases began with the great semifinal of Deriglazova-Shanaeva, then the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of this basketball, the United States-Australia.
I mean, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won.
They've taken the place of officials of their own greatness.
As a result, they have lost, but as it is now said, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer exist.
It's all right, but it's getting closer to the fight with the French, and on the screen without change.
I'm starting to leave the channels in the easy pancake.
That's what it feels like the second time it's hot.
All right, let's go deep on the cables.
Not one of thematic "Matche" matches.
And I feel that the fight is starting.
I don't mind the text and tweets of some sports sites.
The road serfing gives unexpected but devastating results.
The “First”, it is said, is the direct technical transmission of all the events that are taking place at this time.
I'm looking for a filtration, I'm getting one for the gold.
The directive is excellently contrasted, forward-looking, and clearly begins to waste time.
Italian plays almost all the fires.
Our eyes on one eye forward, by the end of two seconds.
Di Francesca is on the Derigalsov, and it is time to end, the Italian is wearing a helmet.
Victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
Looks like I'm the first one to see it with my eyes.
The stupid, the faithful, the participating.
The Muslim Spiritual Management (DUM) of Tatarstan is denied the use of Russian in dreams.
Yesterday, the DOM Plenary was obliged by its owners to preach Friday only to the father so that young fathers could “learn their own language. ”
The administration stated that it was “no offence” to the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some of the meetings, Kazani notes that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
We are afraid that their sermons on the Father's "will not come to the whole audience".
Yesterday, the DUM Plenary of Tatarstan unanimously decided to carry out Friday sermons in the homes of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin said, this should be an incentive for young fathers to “learn their own language. ”
"For those who say it's heavy," said Mr. Samigullin, in every big dream we intend to organize the lessons of the Father's language completely free.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and that today in all the minds of the preachers “should be already in the Father’s language”.
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan is publishing the magazine "Shura" with typical teaching in the Father's language.
I've got one that doesn't sound good enough to say, "I can prepare it thoroughly."
DUM Tatarstan combines more than a thousand revenues in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Mufta, five - year - olds preach in areas where they are only in the Father’s language.
At the same time, Russian was used in a number of museums in Kazakhstan.
In particular, as Muftai indicated, it was practiced in the Burnawe Hall, Zacapan and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhamethhin stressed that the leadership was a task for all students to have in both public languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"It is not possible to say anything about the defeat of the Muslim netator," Mr. Muhammadtshin stressed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a compulsory, basic part of the wage."
At the same time, prayers will continue to be read in Arabic, the dreams contain lessons and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhammadtzin said "Y" that there was no serious threat to the printing of the Father's language from memory.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, the preaching in the Republic is not used.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Fathers (WCT).
The head of the U.S. Secretary-General Renat Zaquirov said, "The goals are an important part of our national life."
It would be embarrassing if I had left this area in the Father's language.
He noted that preaching in the Father's language was only "the desire of the owners", but rather than the WTO "they think it is the right thing to do."
We have requested "E" who preach in Russia are ready to comply with the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of priests.
In the dream the tatras and the Russians are going.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they're going to suffer.
"It's about to stop," I say, I've got the Burnev House of Farhat Maveledin.
According to him, preaching in Russian is even closer to many Tatars, because "Russian and in schools and in children, on radio is a significant journey".
However, he believes that lessons and lessons in the Russian language can be continued in the dream during other days.
In God we put our trust.
Allah will show you the way out."
But about 60% of us don't know the Father language.
It's also rascals, tasys, and Azerbaijani.
We have a lot of foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," I say.
He believes that in the Father’s language, the preaching will “come to a closer circle and will not reach the whole audience”.
But we're going to make the decision of the plenum.
It's just the result of preaching that's gonna be different.
But time will show.
"I, for example, will only be easier, because Father's language is my family," concluded Gabriel Galiullin.
Former director of the FSIN was sent to court
The Moscow Attorney-General has approved the charge of a criminal case under the investigation of the SCR in respect of the budget allocations for the Russian FSIN.
In court, the ex-head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused the loss of the FSIN of over 2.7 billion rubs, would be brought before the court.
The capital prosecutor sent a criminal case against former director of the FSIN Russians Alexander Remer, former deputy of Nicolaa Krivolapov, as well as FGUP Director, " Information and Technology Centre for the Federal Criminal Service" (FGUP CITOS) Victor Determining.
Depending on the role and degree of involvement in crimes, they are accused of the CSC on Moscow under paragraph 3 of paragraph 285 of the CRF (infringement of the official powers resulting from serious consequences), and 4 of 159 of the CRF (majority done using its official status, in the composition of an organized group, particularly in large size).
In addition, Krivopas is charged with a charge under paragraph 1 of paragraph 222 of the CFP (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CPC, in 2010-2012, the persons indicated by moustache have been seized from the public penalty by the budgets allocated to the FSI in order to ensure the administration of electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, as well as the so-called electronic explosives.
In order to generate budgetary money, the group developed a scheme whereby its CITOS subsidiary, which concluded the relevant public contracts, had produced technical control and supervision tools, including “electronic bottlenecks”, and carried out at several times the above-mentioned prices.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings, equipment for the installation of production capacities to create the final cycle of the "electronic bottlenecks" between the CITOS FGUP and the Russian Federation, five guest contracts amounting to more than 3.3 billion rubs were concluded.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubs were made on the accounts of the FGUP branch, of which 1.2 billion rubs were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million rubs of funds were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office by one of the participants in the case of a separate production.
Nicolaa Krivolapov, who participated in the machinery, found an unknown origin of the patrol to the prize gun, which allowed him to be charged with further charges.
In the case of 133 tonne, the FSIN filed a claim for reimbursement of the material damage of 2.7 billion rubs.
Hakan Shukhur's footballist suspects his interest in the road.
The Turkish authorities ordered an arrest of an former football player, and then a member of parliament, Hakana Shukhur, and searched his family's two houses.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s was the beginning of the 2000s attack by the authorities of the country in connection with the attempt to reform the state that took place last month.
Forvard, who finished his career in 2008, was accused of belonging to the “armed terrorist group”.
This is about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious leader and opposition leader, Fethoullah Gulen.
His President, Erdogan, was the organizer of the military conversion attempt on 15 July.
Fethulla Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media reports, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Schukura, which is already being filed by the police in two houses belonging to the family of the former football player.
As a result, Fethullah Gulena was joined by his father in the organization of Fethullah Gulena, apart from Hakan Shuquira himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his close associates were there.
He and his family are now living in the United States.
In his residence as footballist, Hucan Shukhur protected several Turkish clubs and spoke for the country.
He spent most of his career in Galatsara.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torno", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
True, not one of them has had more than one season.
Hukun Shukur is still the most successful attacker in Turkey: he is active with 112 national teams and 51 swords.
In 2013, Hucan Shukhur left his MP post because of the corruption investigation of the party of Erdogan and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey on 25 July by at least 42 journalists.
They have been accused of promoting military conversion and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethoullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the burden of charges, the media can wait for long-term prison terms, from ten years to several years of imprisonment.
Egor Končalovski wants to create a network of cinematists only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemateaters exclusively for Russian cinema, with tickets 2-3 times less than for foreign production films," he said.
Mr. Conchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 images per year in the country, from 20 to 25 litres per year.
"And they're even very hard to deal with "Transformers" and "Greed Man," where huge budgets are expected," said the cinematographer.
Remember, on July 1st in Crimea, a youth education forum at the University of Belarus was launched.
Among the participants were the teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian directions throughout Russia and a number of neighbouring and far-reaching countries.

E-Newsty - The New Genocator promises to give Zenit-Arenu on 26 December.
The new founder of the St. Petersburg stadium, which is to be hosted by the Cuban Confederacy 2017 and the 2018 Football World Championship, the company Metrostroy, promises to launch an arena by 26 December, informs RIA News, referring to the head of the time commission of the Federation's football training team, 2018 Vadima Tullpanova.
"Today we, along with the Russian sport minister, Vitaly Mutko, visited the strike, with us was the director of "Metrostraya" Vadim Aleksandrov.
He said he'd get a stadium by 26 December.
It's a big Petersburg company, it's never breaking time.
Vitaly Mutco and I have remained quite visible and heard," the agency of the constable quoted him as saying.
Previously, Vitaly Mutco had arrived in St. Petersburg to review the location of large-scale funerals.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that the Sufed Commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would visit the stream regularly.
Remember, yesterday it became known that the company "Metrostrosto" would complete the construction of Zenit-Arena, the value of the contract would be about 5.4 billion rubs. The same company won trade in the well-being of the area around the stadium, the value of the contract - 2.4 billion rubs. Contracts with AO "Transstroy", OO" Engineering Corporation Transstroy" and AO "Transstroy" were broken down.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.

In Miasse (Celeabine District), former Deputy Governor Nicolaa Sandakov Konstantin Akulić was detained.
As another lawyer, Sergei Colossian, a lawyer of the "E-South Ural" reported, Konstantin Akulica has today called on the SCRC Miass to file charges for an annual record of the execution.
Constantine Akulic then went to the DTP as a lawyer to assist one of his party.
"It was a little excited about the homeless, and now that he started protecting Nikola Sandakov, it seemed that it was Akulić," he says, Sergei Colossian.
Constantine Akulic became a former deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
In the meantime, prior to the challenge of the defence counsel at the Miyass District, he announced that on Monday he had been informed of the cases of fraud in which Nicolaa Sandakov was accused.
Remember, there are two criminal cases involving Nikolai Sandakov.
Under the first (the case of fraud), he was violated a promise of 1.5 million rubs to assist the appointment of the Chief Magnitgor of the Administration of Osserska Eugenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case relates to the receipt that Nikolai Sandakov received from the Chief of the PI “Piton” Igorya Kalugina in the form of an illegal provision of property-free services of at least 1.3 million rubs.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in the material "E" "The former vice-president requires a union of his actions".
The Russian Medical Company (MIC) is ready to take social responsibility and give more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the modernization of one of the oldest and the environmentally "green" enterprises of the Caribbean Mediterranean.
The Caribbean Medieval Institute was founded by an English shareholders' society in the head of Lesley Urkvart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was important to the economy of the country, and it actually provided the livelihood of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, because of the financial problems, production has been resumed, leading to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Caribbean Medical Committee.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Caribbean industry - environmental.
By the beginning of 2000, Karabash had been well-known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company passed under the control of the Russian Medical Company.
The company began to modernise production, gradually reducing environmental load on the environment.
This has recently been noted by Governor of the Chelabinian area of Boris Dubrovski, who visited the first number of July "Carabashmed".
The head of the Southern Urala called for the radical changes that have taken place since Karabashmede was transferred to the RMK Group.
The main modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new cernox, which allows the capture of 99.9 per cent of metallurgy gases.
According to the President of the Russian Medical Company, the total investment in the project was around 7 billion rubs.
The next phase of the modernization of the Karabashmed ZAO is the reconstruction of the conversion process.
The replacement of three converters, sinks, gas pipelines is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The value of the project is 2.5 billion rubs.
In addition, it is planned at the end of 2016 to start a new cleaning of industrial goods at a cost of 1 billion rubs.
In turn, the amount of taxes calculated in the budget of the city of Karabash will increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the Tominian Goka project, from the beginning of construction and before the second operation, the federal penalty will be 8.9 billion rubs.
And after the GMO's introduction into operation, tax revenue at all levels may amount to $80.9 billion.
For the year of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubs are budgeted at different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"As long as the company works successfully, the amount of bills may be higher," added Valerie Ulanovski.
In the IPCC, it was explained that in 2015, the tax returns from the Miheev Goka were close to 1 billion rubs.
However, the participation of RCCs in the lives and development of their territories is not limited to tax calculations.
RMK companies help to rebuild and maintain schools, children's gardens, sports facilities, to build cultural and recreational facilities, to benefit the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Medical Company in Karabash became a capital repair, and the almost complete refurbishment of the N9 children's garden to 95 adults was almost complete.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
In the territory of RMK Arena, land park is also situated with artificial fruit, land and land for 600 cars, coffee and sports stores.
RMK Arena will be able to carry out outstanding international sports activities.
However, the main objective of the project is to make physical and sport comfortable for the inhabitants of Chelabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The United States of America is considering the imposition of sanctions against the RF due to the abuse of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States consider the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the abuse of the servers of the Democratic Party, The Wall Street Journal, referring to sources.
It is reported that for sanctions to be imposed by U.S. President Barak Obama, he would have to be officially charged with attacks on Russian servers or supported by Russian hackers.
According to the sources, the FBI and other American specialists are virtually convinced of Russia's participation in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the United States generally prefers not to identify any hacker attackers.
The exception is the damage to the company's data base of Sony Entertainment Pictures, which was officially charged to the DPRK.
In the past year, however, Obama issued a decree facilitating the imposition of sanctions on those who perform or contribute to cyberattacks.
It was directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, the issue is written.
Even if officials have come to the conclusion that the hackers have acted with Russia's support, they should have the possible impact before deciding to disclose the information.
They need to determine whether such a serious event is likely to increase tension in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the administration of Barak Obama allowed the use of sanctions against the State in which the hackers violated the services of the Democratic Party's Nazi party.
The WikiLeaks website has published an electronic list of the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in fraud.
In Kremlin, such reports were considered absurd.
The FAS spent almost half a billion dollars on Google's rubles
This has led to a distortion of competition in the mobile applications market.
The anti-dumping investigation was initiated on the Jandex initiative.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides users of smartphones with access to Android components under conditions that prevented other developers from preventing applications, in particular from the Yandexa.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company abused the dominant market position and forced the manufacturers of mobile devices to install with Google Play other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Anti-Fraud Service decided to punish Google and informed FAS leader Alexei Dozenko.
The penalty shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the decision.
The FAS concluded that the competition protection law should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In its context, Google has begun to examine the decision and only then it will be determined by further actions: to execute it or to defend it.
The Federal Anti-Fraud Service recognized the company as a violation of competition law in September last year and proposed that the treaties be corrected by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, companies and agencies have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the tax, they discussed with Google the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
Such an opinion was made by Ehu Moscow, a leading analyst on Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the tax is never addressed to the users or to the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat’s Effect Criticizes Asian Caricature
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired, but some skeptics say it's racist.
With the help of the Linza tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million users to change the reality of the day and to play with individualities that limit to absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or a person to face the picture of King Liechtenstein.
Linza is a rough, fragrant piece of instruments that create over 30 million decorrected cells a day.
All errors quickly become public.
Snapchat's Lins were criticized in the past when they were accused of announcing the dark skin of the person or of encouraging the selected ones as an ideal beauty.
So when some users offered this week a lens, which gave them hair with eyes, red teeth, and dust, some critics thought it was a racist character to Asians, "jellicles".
They also asked whether these repeated objections to a more serious issue related to diversity were raised.
In the middle, communications were circulated and followed in reports of The Verge and Motherboard, the following day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented: the lens was thought to be respect for the animal and not as the character of the Asians.
But experts who know about racism do not know, the Lens reminded them of the disturbing stereotypes in action.
The others totally rejected the comparison with the diamond.
In an e-mail letter to Grace Sprapani, a Korean-American student of art whose tweets were actively photographed, said that the lens was “at least as bad as it was.”
She added that "it was hard to argue with the comparison of the side of a very grave character on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just ironic but, above all, destructive ironic.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness from the corporate halls of meetings to Hollywood and the demons, which we are all wearing.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat - which is more racially diverse than their older generation - can mean that they are more likely to be understood.
When one of the Snapchat lens creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katy Jo, said, "that is why the events are much harder to remain undetected as they were before."
In Thursday, Ju, the production manager and engineer working on the Medium, decided to remove his account in Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and on the telephone, she said that racial differences were considered to be the cause of insufficient diversity in the collection of staff in Snepta.
Jou was critical of the company's leadership, consisting only of men and finished her article with a joke: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Ju, who himself is a Chinese-American, he wrote: “They did not have enough white people in the state to make such decisions, or they were working with white people, but they did not take such positions as could be safely and openly stated.”
Other critics share her point of view, noting that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the presence of national minorities in its State, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired the Recruiter to focus on the inadequate areas of the population and on the active attempts to incorporate domestic resources.
Ju said on his side that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding: "I am interested in whether they really need more users like us to be able to say that will not happen."
Military leadership informed of the IGIL, reporting to the Congress
Staff members of the United States Armed Forces ' Central Command changed their explosive records to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they had given the basis for the events on the ground, reported to the Congress Committee on the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Chairmans of the Committee of the Chamber of Representatives on CV, the Disclosure Committee and the Sub-Committee on Military Provisions, revealed a “wide disfavor” among the analyses of the Central Intelligence Service, which claimed that the leaders had conducted their assessment of American actions aimed at the victory over the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the Center, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Research documents, approved by the Supreme Command of the Center, usually gave a more optimistic picture of US counter-terrorism actions than confirmed actual data from the scene, and were more stable than the analysis provided by other special services,” said a news report.
"What has happened in the Centrum is unacceptable: when the superior leadership is a mistrust analysis, our soldiers suffer," said a member of the House of Representatives of Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
The problems with leadership in the Centcoma have reached the highest level of organization.
The ten-page reports provide detailed insights into the ongoing child abuses in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training Iraqi military forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain final evidence that the members of the administration of Obama have ordered false reports, he argues that the analyses felt that the CENTC leadership had to present them with a more optimistic view of the threat by the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command at Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events,” the report reported.
For example, the official of the Centcoma said publicly that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is a well-known superstition," said a member of the House of Representatives of Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence service management of the United States Central Command has provided intelligence documents to reduce the threat of IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans created an operational group when they learned that the analyses expressed concern that the disclosures about the Islamic State had been false.
As the investigation progresses, the report published in Thursday follows more detailed data.
In addition, an investigation by the Centre is not completed at this time by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party to the Committee on the Exploration of the Chambers of Congress of the United States have published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican operational group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, the Center established an over-exhaustible investigation process on IGIL and Iraq's defence troops," says the member of the House of Representatives of Adam B. Šiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shiffa, "sustained the issuance of explosives", has damaged the moral state of the analysts and "depends on the cost of their views".
However, the Sheriff and Democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to influence the analysts of the Center to convince them of their conclusion under “professional or political interpretation”.
The preliminary findings of the Congress were presented on Tuesday at The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of Pentagon, who was found following the complaints of the Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, the representative of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the chief inspector's investigation continued.
However, he said that “experts sometimes spend their views on integrated data, and the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues of national security”.
The results of the investigation are based on the question of whether the goals of the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now claims) are being achieved.
However, last year's statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama could rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of disclosures on the Islamic State repeats the controversy that took place more than a decade ago when an analysis of the intelligence service of Centcoma Gregory Hucker wrote a research article, which claimed that President George Uokera Bush's administration had expressed support for the small number of troops in Iraq and did not consider what was happening after the launch of 2003.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest against the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hungarian team concluded that despite public declarations of return, aircraft belonging to the Islamic State did not significantly undermine the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil companies to sell oil on the black market.
However, the opening was not extended beyond the Central Command, as reported in the September Times newspaper.
The then commander of the Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the Senate, which many MPs considered to be extremely optimistic about the war.
General Ostin was released in April and was placed in the Central Commandment of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States dollar wins four times in the female hockey on the grass, so it's getting closer to Britain's decisive match.
When she was hit by three holes in the matatu that ended her victory over Japan with account 6-1, Katy Bam opened the account on Thursday for the first two rounds for the U.S. Women's hockey team on the ground, when the Americans had won over India's team with account 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but BAM, who is 27 years old, says she is not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I don't understand," she said.
I'm not actually one of those people who track their heads.
This is what she knows: the 4-0 American account in the Olympic tournament, and they meet for the first time in their group with Britain, which remains unconquered after Japan's 2-0 match on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim for a quarter-final, and the results of the game determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong opposition team from the Netherlands, the leaders of the other group, shortly after the game of the quarter-finals begins.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took their last place among 12 teams in London.
Bum was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took the key to a hockey tree when she was 3 (her older sisters played in this type of sport in Drexel), and joined a 16-year-old national club, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not pass the election tour in the final composition.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammate did not agree.
The following year, Coyge Parnheim, an English trainer, was appointed, and everything began to change.
"Culture change, psychological change, physical training," said Bam.
In London we had no productivity that is now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the account in the first half of the game with a rough hand on a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprised and maintained account 1 to 0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long walk with a sword down the left side of the field, then she went into the middle and ran a sword into the door, so she gave the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final round in the middle of the fourth period.
The "all" victory was the first in the tournament for the U.S. Jacky Briggs, who lost one bullet in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
Like bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the midst of the fall of the Olympics, the "day" of battleships
Wherever you are, no matter how much time you have, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are said to be inevitable and inevitable, a false combination of coercion and effort.
I mean, it's an Olympic fire, and there's a hot facsimile that's going to be transferred from the ball to the ball, to the gym, to the triangular.
You can't include TV, respect the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talking about coffee and not hear about Simon Bails, Katie Ledeki or about the enemy between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
There's still Logan Dolly.
Douli, who was first involved in the Olympic Games, was a jewellery with beads, could well be among the fames shown in the premixtures that promote sponsors and life-reverent advertising roles, if he was a thief, glamour, or even a fettolist.
But 28-year-old Douli from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympics on the boat.
The Olympic Fire does not light all the events in the same way.
Far from the center, partly in the dark, there are those types of sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shots, light shots, badminton, tequiwondo.
Brass will always be with us, for his kingdom.
But if I'm allowed to say something in defense of my personal attachment, let me draw your attention to the humble promise of the boots.
Although boat races are the Olympics since 2000, when they voted for games in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of my people have not been in the course that they are in the Olympics at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States and sent athletes to the competitions, they never won medals in the boots, and their athletes did not finish until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually make men's rewards, and Chinese and Canadians are women.
Don Dun from China and Rose McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the shoes on the boots have the charm of autsaider, especially because they are associated with a circus college more quickly than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, but an earthly enthusiasm.
They have indeed a chemical potential — a characteristic milking of endless bees — but also the experience of gymnostics and water beaks, two types of sports that they mainly gather in themselves.
The word "butt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolin", meaning "traplin for drops of water".
The claim for victory is due to a giant battalion of nearly 30 feet in the air and must complete the series of acrobatic trolleys (floats, swivels and salts) until the final ground on the feet.
They are evaluated for performance, complexity and flight time, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will meet in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is ahead.
Claimants on medals should go further, faster, faster, higher and higher in gold after gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, right here in the field.
They strive not only to the finish line or to the start stage, but also to the farthest foreign telecom: the world or the Olympic record.
This intense desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fantastic — and it strikes it to stop even looking at a viewer.
But I think it's a bit of a joke about the game.
From him, the boats on the boat give way to the wind.
The direction of the Batutist is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, as if it were an asteroid, flys up, then down, then without exerting any effort on it again.
And, of course, there are no competitions or difficulties, but throughout the programme there is no sense of ending, no long-term thresholds, only a strange, long-term waste of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the day of the Olympics.
Women's qualification exercises, and then the finals will be held on Friday, the transition will take place on the day of the Eastern European era; the men will be on Saturday, and also on the hour.
NBC will transmit the final within the agenda from 14:00 a.m. in two days.
An olympic mixture is expected to be a peaceful, beautiful moment, which can easily be seen in a common dish.
And if awareness-raising can only be achieved by providing sportsmen with guided views and objectives, as Wall Street Journal has recently predicted that men of the United States are only waiting for their new spaceship.
"Protesting generation" in Ethiopia, former United States Union
Prosperity protests in Ethiopia
Democrats calling for political change in Ethiopia were confronted with fierce opposition from the Government.
The audience said that dozens of protesters were killed during police encounters.
Is Ethiopia really at the edge of the continent?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a strong Western Union with a rapidly developing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have devastated the country, widening its territory.
Only in recent weeks have thousands gone into the streets, requiring radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was cruel.
It was claimed that the police officers had shot dozens of non-armed protesters.
Videos from protest sites, supposedly taken at the end of the past year or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the project "African Rog" in the international research group.
Ethiopia is the second inhabited African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly — even a new garden trip to the capital of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations were constantly referring to governmental repressions — opposition to the territory of the State was halted by the fact that dissidents were actually forced to shut down.
Many of them were sent, imprisoned, killed or expelled in distant villages.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly upset and do not leave other options than protest, there will be a rise," said Seyum Teshome, lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending the occupation of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the government party and its allies were fully opposed, and 100 per cent of Parliament is now under control.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is growing; the fight against this uncertain, controversial border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analyticals fear that separatist groups that have been destroyed more or less in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use ammunition and weapons.
A number of factors explain why feelings of anger, which, for a few years, are deep within the soul, are now exhilarating.
First, it would be perfectly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate in social networks, as deaf smartphones have been tested, and Internet services have improved.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, two major Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries Amhara has flourished in politics and business throughout the highly Christian high regions of Ethiopia, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together at the same time," said Mulat Gemech, leader of Oromo.
Major protests have taken place in the Amhari and Oromo regions.
Many of the Amhari and Oromo feel that in Ethiopia, ethnic group members of Turkey are wrongly dominant, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason for this is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, former rebel leader, served the duties of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, resulting in his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict the danger.
Analyticals claim that he was particularly skilled in identifying the first signs of discontent and using investigators to obtain data and to discourage opposers.
"The current regime does not have a healthy sense," said Abdi, an analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Haylemriam Desaljan, appeared somewhere and took place in Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Turkish region in northern Ethiopia, the Himalayas are South-East.
Analysts say that he does not benefit from the trust of security services controlled by Turkey.
Many fear that this will result in further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia survived such a wave in 2005, after thousands of people protested against the fact that, as the analysts said, it was apparent, the elections that the Government had ordered and then the results were made.
During the follow-up repression, many Protestants were killed, even in the lowest number compared to the last months, and this period of beatings was relatively fast.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as new international travel and significant success in combating poverty.
But it is evident that this has not been the case with the Government of Ethiopia.
And it's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Honduras, the city of Amhar, attacked Turkish companies, and anti-Turkey hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analyticals claim that protestors make the United States and other Western Unions uncomfortable.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that the base had been closed.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his Union to lose its force in an already unstable region.
"And it's going to be hard to go on this excited canady," said Abdi.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that the IGIL was founded by Obama, the "sarp"
Donald J. Tramp tried to replace the last conflict covering his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he had failed several times this week when President Obama and Hillary Clinton stated that they were “founders” of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to act as President of the Republican Party to approach the American people in a reasonable way.
It also set up its alternates who tried to protect him during the war period, in a state of inhumanity, as they had been able to explain statements that he probably did not have in mind.
In expressing this assumption at the meeting in the middle of the evening, Tramp insisted on his fourth statement, repeating in the interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded the IGIL.
But in the post in Twitter early Friday morning, Tramp wrote that he was just exaggerating.
This post was directly contradicted by the statement made on the day before, when Tramp said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When Radio Conservative Hyu Heu Huitt tried to help the trampo ease the statement, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy the IGIL, the candidate for the presidential post of the Republican Party had not taken advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Tramp tried to redirect his campaign to the economy on the basis of a rating reduction.
Tramp and Clinton spoke with competing economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Tramp tried again to get back to this subject.
Once again he fled to Twitter, he insisted that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and he said that it was a joke.
The tramp has already been used as a justification.
Finally, at the end of July, after he had resorted to a general criticism, he practically expressed the idea that Russians should corrupt Clinton's e-mail, explaining his comments later, saying, "I'm going to go."
This approach allows the Treaty to go beyond what is politically acceptable and to take its words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing those or other communications that are repugnant to his worshipers, to see how they act, and then to "explain" them on the other hand, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and he knows that they're pretty excited enough to treat them differently.
Instead of smoothing the references to the broad electricity, the tramp has taken even more vulnerable tone in recent days, while its rating continues to fall.
A new rating NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that the tramp is joining Clinton with a large transfer to North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is coming with it at Florida level.
Although Tramp is usually trying not to apologize for the provocations he says, he often accuses his critics of mistranslating his words and misunderstanding his sense of honor.
However, as Tramp became the focus of the presidential campaign in the last few months, his attacks placed his loyal allies in a neutral position: they had to support him publicly, regardless of the cause or expression.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former Mr. New York, who is one of the most famous successors to the tramp, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he says is a welcome political comment,” Juliani said when asked about the credibility of Trampa's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was almost unknown to a small organization, he called it a non-prominent threat, which was absolutely unjust, and that is why everything happened because he withdrew the army from Iraq.
Most of the media Republicans believe that the administration of Obama, in which Clinton took office of the State Secretary, has allowed IGIL to develop, as it has not been able to cope with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the briefing in Pennsylvania on Friday, the tramp continued to attack on Twitter the means of mass media for the interpretation of each word and for its clarity.
He spoke of the "poor unhappy" television experts trying to explain it and said, "They're weak!"
Some democracies have mocked the excuses of Trampa, as further confirmation that he was not in favour of the presidents.
Sometimes a thirsty coffee comes back to Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee was packed with only available place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pulled out of her apartment with a liquid on Bedford Avenue.
The Sop Sherry store, which took place in the summer of 2014, is sold in the form of cakes.
The locals cried out to her as the last loss in the modern city.
Lord Molly Crabapall wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB's dead, Ot Chelsea's dead, and Werb's now in the mail store."
But while New York is constantly changing, it is constantly updating.
The Verb coffee plant was opened in November last year in Grinpoint, less than in a mile north of the original.
The new Werbe has Wi-Fi and is receiving credit cards, but there are still some of the same staff, and it looks like a simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
In the head of the new Verba, Sisco Rodriguez, an old coffeeman, who is the owner and general manager of the new site.
He started working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said he would be happy to go there.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, left many behind.
Werb works with the same bee distributor and bought the same model of coffee.
It even has pictures of the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He's been offering new flowers.
In the menu are sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are poppings from the cuppers or a hot hole.
There's a blubber from the burs.
There's no more beer in the coffee, but now they're making fresh juices.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he focused on the constant flow of old clients.
"Many former customers have also paid prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Olivier was one of those clients.
Olivier, who lived in Williamsberg in the past 34 years and visited Werb a lot.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After closing Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that the coffee and the atmosphere had impressed me at Verbe," she said.
Now she has five coffees again, although that day she ordered another newspaper instead of the usual coffee.
Tom Rosental, another old client, visited Werb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"Fifty minutes in the eighth, every day, as in time, I came, and for me, my bicycle was prepared with oil and with all kinds of means," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new leaves in the menu.
Today, Rosental still makes the usual order, but sometimes he changes something with the help of a bacon, an egg or a pigeon in every way.
Rodriguez said he wasn't trying to make the store look like he used to own an old place.
Moreover, the owners of Sop Sherry offered to prepare a special meal for Verba, using coffee made of coffee, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree with their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The permanent inhabitants of Grinpoint of Poland also loved the coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the desert so that his new neighbors would feel like themselves.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juices is intended to separate by bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold manner.
There is the likelihood that the coffee will join the next building.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Verb will include their favorite leaves in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and divided that he was killed in the village when they closed.
When the coffee was opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma?" he confessed.
Depressive eating of the depression in the Pluto trapeze
In March 1933, shortly after the resignation of the President, Franklin Delano Rusvelt, visited the Oval office.
As a guruman, President Rusvelt loved fashionable blues on Fifth Avenue, for example, the fu-game and the Meriland sculptor.
Its menu was more modest this day: crushed eggs in a tomato sauce, potatoes and on a desert - powder from the blackberry.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask."
Wifes living in Brooklyn Heights are food professionals.
The last book of Kowa, "Ragu More Chinese", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a quiet neighborhood in the South East Side by eating in his book "Dom 97 on the street of the Fruit garden".
Their new joint work, the Platinum Trappeza, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American Food in the Great Depression.
With some degree of their own colonial solidarity, they met with the reportant at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a short-cooked breakfast in the Flateron Square, which has been working since 1929 in the Birze Valley.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a sleigh cheese and butterboard with olives, and Kou, 57 took the Indian, potatoes, and fruit juice.
When the reporter ordered a misrule, the couple considered this an appropriate starting point for discussion on food in the period of Depression.
"The routes were used with a bigger demand," said Zigelman.
There was an archive roll, a doll roll, a doll roll.
They were made of the main ingredient and of the product of the product that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine that you've eaten as much rice as you need to eat.
Who helped.
"He must have been lying in a frozen rock," he said.
Years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups were prepared for male farmers, and freshly preserved cheese was placed for breakfast, dinner and lunch.
That's why Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The fleshy trapeze describes how the country had coped with the fact that the country had ceased to be a country of disintegration.
"It was the time when food became a central, not an easy subject for Americans," said Cou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
It was also difficult to make a new budget statement: forgotten leaves, such as roulettes and bakeries, have become the main food products; the bakery is a “precious way to use clothing,” said Zigelman, because it could stop unappetuous ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by more sweeter juices.
The meat, which has been a source of ancient American food for many years, has become an economical crop.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and food values have become more important than taste and even colonial health.
By studying the book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared the leaves of that era: a sealed leaf, sealed with an aqueous oil.
"This addition to the dinner table was not successful," Kou said.
Zigelman added, "That was really weird."
A harvest oil is not entirely suitable for the harvest.
This was natural for many household recipes.
As never before and ever since, house - to - house experts, including Luisa Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Housing from 1923 to 1943, have managed the food habits of countries.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to be “budget-makers”, to accept challenges and to convert the burden of the species of lost coral in delicious leaves.
"Float trapeze" is a set of curious historical facts.
Especially interesting stories about the Government's reaction to hungering citizens, for example, to President Herbert Guver's position in the spirit of "let the pirates eat".
Publicly transporting a simple farm plot of the state of Iowa during its childhood, he asked himself as the sun’s millionaire who had become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, fish with a hot sauce," Kou said.
He was practically in a golden table, hoping to shine.
He was fascinated by reality.
President Roosevelt could make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor did not advise him to give him an example of his own jealousy.
As told in the book, Eleanor Rusvelt had bought an economy that was totally not interested in taste, and this led to the White House “use not only the single food in Washington but also the most disgustingly prepared”.
Many of the colonial occupations of the period of Depression have been forgotten as long as the country again stood on its feet.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and food, says Zigelman, and on how science was used in preparing food.
The husband explains that at the time of writing the books, they had better understand the food habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not eat.
"She was seriously afraid of being left here," said Kou.
Zigelman recalls, "She's been a full-fledged man."
There was one unpleasant case with the propellers.
When the sails in Eisenberg's deserts arrived, they and Cou had a dessert that they had prepared at home: a dessert from a bakery, which President Rusvelt went to dinner.
"It's called a black mouse," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widespread welcome - to give modest recipes to broccoli names.
The slain were not only cold, a little pain, sugar, water, and corn.
They've all pushed the bed into a tight, comfortable, soft substance.
Surprisingly, it was harmless.
Who asked for extras twice.
He said to the woman, with the voice of a trusted budgetary representative, "The Greek ruby would not be mixed here."
The arrest of figures on the mass drama at the Hovan Labbe was extended until 14 November
The Presnetic Court left a case of mass trauma at the Hovan Lambasta until 14 November, in compliance with the relevant case-law application.
In case, 14 persons were convicted.
We recall that on 14 May, a massive wave of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus were killed by weapons.
The former leader of the branch of Yuriu Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization “Healthy Nation”, Alexander Bocarnikov, was charged with the murder organization.
The second issue for 2016 could be settled within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of the RF Olga Golodez reported this during a visit to the Bransk area.
We have specific parameters, as much as we need to increase pensions in order to mitigate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now the economists are doing this for a half year, and we'll finish this job in the next two or three weeks," says the Golden Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexe Qudrine's plan to increase pension age per year, the vice-president reported that the issue was not addressed in the cabinet.
At the end of July it was known that the Government had agreed to the full index of pension payments in 2017.
Stone and Grigorian have gone to the end of the shooting of a small-scale wine.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenskiy and Cyril Grigoryan went to the end of the shooting of a small-scale wine from the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to the TASS, Sergei Kamenski took 629 balls and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9.
Eight better athletes went to the end.
The stone is the world recordr in this discipline (663).
The Turkish opposition, Fethulla Gulen, called for an international investigation of the status of the attempted coup in Turkey.
“I require the independent international commission to investigate the attempt to reform the state,” says the French newspaper Le Monde, Guilena.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any part of the charges is confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen has always refused to participate in the referendum, stressing that his organization has never appealed to the political authority.
The Stambula court had previously been arrested by an opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulena.
We recall that the military conversion attempt took place in Turkey from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies are reimbursed for legal services during a patent dispute with Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc company has the right to reimburse the costs of the legal services it has incurred in connection with the patent of hepatitis C with Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge.
In June, the Gilead company was exempt from the payment of $200 million in damages to two Merck patents related to the medicines of Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical proceedings.
At the trial in the fourth court of the U.S. Federal District Court, Bet Lebson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to reimburse costs incurred during the search.
Merck is trying to attract Gilead, which dominates the new generation of medicines from hepatitis C, which can treat more than 90 per cent of patients with cancer.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck were brought to court, declaring their rights to the laboratory work based on the sophosbuvir active ingredient of the Gilead medicine.
The armed forces established in support of the United States claim that they have taken full control of Manbija in the Islamic State
The armed forces created with the support of the United States had been fully controlled by the northern city of Manbij along with the Turkish border, after the last remaining members of the Islamic State were left in the fight town, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after leaving the remaining group of fighters hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian detainees detained by combatants and reported to the Reuters agency Charfan Darviš from the military council of Manbaija.
"The city is now under our control, but we are doing clean-up operations," he reported to the Reuters agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
Hillary Clinton announced its 2015 tax statements on Friday, which showed that the candidate in presidential democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in voluntary contributions, mainly at the Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in the form of statements, and the former Secretary of State announced that Simon & Schuster had received $3 million from her book on her residence in the State Department.
The potential Vice-President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Cain of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, made tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain continue to set the standard of financial transparency," said Chief Chief of Staff, Clinton Jennifer Palmer.
In full opposition to them, Donald Tramp is hiding his excuses and violates his previous promises to make his tax declarations public.
This is the usual case for candidates in the United States presidents to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them.
The New York businesswoman Tramp and his lawyers called for the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to disclose his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote the Advisor of President Clinton Jan Sams on Twitter, with a statement from the Democratic Party's candidate.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Coin told the CNN that it would not allow the Trampa to issue them before the end of the inspection.
Trampa's criticisms, including the candidate from the Republican Party in 2012, said that his rejection raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton got caught up in this issue and released an online video on Friday, where he was directed to the issuing Republicans who had convinced the trampa to find a tax account.
On Thursday, she raised this issue at a time when she was talking about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate has done without exception to the Presidents for ten years: to publish his tax declarations," she said to the assembled.
The Politico newspaper reported that the tramp paid no or almost no taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times business-insurer was prosecuted on Friday by many tax lawyers and bookkeepers who thought that the case might have been so far.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of debate in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule called a billionaire, investor Warren Buffet, which would guarantee that people who receive more than $1 million a year would pay tax tax at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omahe, Nebraska, Buffett, which was based on the Berkshire Hataway Conglomerate, offered to meet and exchange the tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under IRS verification, and that the tramp was “fighting” not by tax gathering agencies, but by voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters had issued tax declarations by 2007.
Clintons currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 statement showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and Clinton claimed dividends and income from the capital of $109,000.

Conservatives with sand and firemen increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
In Tanzania, environmental cargoes use a non-traditional method of mixing elephants into public areas — they are pumping condoms filled with wax.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Nature Protection Committee, took on its move, training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protect their homes and homes without harming animals.
Many used to use copies to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the Day of Al-Qadar (the Day of Resurrection) of Al-Qadar (the Day of Resurrection).
"Since we have created a set of instruments ..., we observe changes in the relations within these communities, which makes them more confident that they can not leave elephants in their fields without causing injuries," said Executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps are in front of the breached border with the sludge and signalling with the help of the clock.
If he couldn't be scared, they're breaking what's called the "beautiful chili."
The cheetah mixed with soil is placed with a hole in the container, and the end of it is closed, with only fytillas left.
When the container is burned, it is struck with a pitch of dust, and it is blown into the air by a black hole in the air.
One definition is usually sufficient to open the elephant on the other side.
The next step is the launch device that fires the Roman lights into the air by producing a gray, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after the attempt to host the country in July of this year.
Such data were brought to the head of the IMD of Turkey, Mevlut Chavoshoglu, in consultation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we called 208 diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these 32 persons have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish Foreign Policy Office.
We recall that in July Turkey, an attempt to reform the State took place.
The authorities officially stated that the governor had disappeared and reported that more than six thousand people had been detained, including the military forces of the highest and middle tribe.
As a result of the attempt by the hoster, 290 people were killed, according to the IMD of Turkey.
The Jewish Director strongly criticised the Berlin office for the removal of Israel ' s telephone code on the “demand” of Arab—reported channel RT News
The French director of Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that Kempinski Bristol in Berlin did not have a list of Israel ' s telephone code, which referred to "requests" by Arabic clients.
Claude Lantzman, author of the documentary film on Hollocoste Shoa, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Bristol department in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay in Lanzman, Israel tried to find a list of telephone codes provided by the branch.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States where it could be called directly from the room.
How was it possible that in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel, was excluded and deleted in 2016?
Written by Lantzman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to collect Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In the search for explanation, the director raised the issue at the time of the hospital administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lantzman, was "scocked him."
Clarke of the Hospital said that this measure was "a deliberate decision to run the Kempinski Hotel Network."
The reason for this move was even greater anger by the director.
“Most of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed,” he said, according to Lanzman, a hospital servant.
Israel's Ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a terrible sight", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were hit and shocked by the incident.
It's, in fact, a terrible sight.
What happened in Germany and in this network of hotels is even greater.
There's no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the officer said.
The case has caused little resonance on the Internet; people have called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the hotel Kempinski simply “went on” in the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“They would be late, ” said another post, indicating that the hotel on the famous Kurfurstendamm street is in line with the synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to dismiss any charges, calling the "unexpected" and "striking" before Lantzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order for Israel not to be included in the quick list," quoted by the representative of the Kempinski Hospital, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds what the code is now added.
Police use exhaust gas and repugnant pulses against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the city of San Paulo on Thursday, when they were gathered to protest against government reform of the public education system.
The police used exhaust gas and rescinding bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to intimidate the students, resulting in the use of rabies and exhaust gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns about plans.
According to the proposal of the Governor of the state of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributiond to save money.
Some of the protest participants could be seen writing on graphs directed against President Michael Temer's temporary responsibilities.
This last protest took place just a few days after the mass protests went into the streets to support the foreign President, Dilmo Rusef, when the Senate voted for her impiety.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 per cent - reporting the RT Business Portal
With the abolition of sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, as the Russian Ambassador to Iran Lebanon Jagarjan said.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest of Russian business companies in the country has been seen growing.
Russian companies are re-connected with Iran, and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 and constituted $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports in Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the delivery of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagaran also predicts that this year Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran first entered 20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with confidence that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, hoping that the Ambassador will change.
"I personally recommend that I visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jezd, in which memories of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to shut down the fences in the defence-industrial complex.
As a result of the release, the "systematic failure" of the direction of the director of the Almas-Antey concert, "relief in work" and "loss of confidence".
The NGO leader has been appointed Gennadi Benderski for the next three years.
Information on the release of Nescorrodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not generate a wide range of resonance in the media.
What can be explained by such silence in the context of the vast arms transition of the army?
In any event, the leadership of the IMF does not wish to disseminate any hearings or negative assumptions in the public.
This alone confirms that there are many problems in the defence-industrial complex (OPC) and that the State does not want to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of Necrorodov is certainly an important event in terms of the order in the industry.
NGO Almaz is the main enterprise of a concert that specializes in the production of the marine and ground-based genetics complexes.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Police-Red and Morphea, which is planning to set up new corridors, frigates, osmins and creisers.
The founder of the Military Russian port, Dmitry Cornev, believes that the release of Nescorrodov is due to a series of deadlines on these projects.
This version is the most logical one.
For example, the development of Morphea began in 2007, and the entry into force was expected in 2013.
"Poliment-Redut" must be the main system of VAT on new VMF ships.
According to the information I receive, no tests have been carried out in a few years.
The truth is, as far as I can judge, there is no single fault of Almasa, Cornev said.
The expert is afraid that delay in operation may also occur with C-500.
The pilot-building work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016, the first sets have to be entered into the army.
In Minoboron, they believe that "the work will be carried out on a planned basis and will all be completed within the established deadlines", although in 2014 the Government recognized that there were problems with the development of C-500.
Finally, it is difficult to assess the professional qualities of Nescorodov, led by Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that the cuts in project time could be both the cause and the reason for the release.
In his view, it has been extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in OPCs and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money, of course, love silence.
As a rule, the directors of defence companies leave positions on their own, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another work.
In this case, the exemption was public, although it was not justified.
This suggests that Almaza's leader may have been a stripper and was opposed to the "disorders".
At the same time, the State is no longer committed to peace with such conduct.
It will remove those who prefer to dispute with the Minoboron institutions and do not perform the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the RF leadership seeks to punish the tested managers (star machinery).
The Chair personally took note of the sector's problems.
Vladimir Putin led the Military Industrial Commission and held meetings on arms transfers periodically.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC administrators, seeking to have the legal composition of directors, who will carry out the orders received above.
This was far from an ideal policy, but it was based on corruption and the lack of normal competition in OPC of other instruments in the State.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates Kremlin to move as quickly as possible into the armed forces.
In parallel with the "cleaning" management of the OPCC, the RFF is taking full steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian army.
The military staff gained a new quality with the arrival of Minister of Defence Sergey Shoogo.
It is an impression that the President has taken on arms a famous talk entitled “Peace - ready for war”.
During the cold war, the military force of the SSR and the nuclear parity achieved in 1970 led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which strengthened the continent ' s influence in Moscow.
In all the shortcomings of the Bipolar system, it worked effectively.
The absence of war on the European continent and on the stable situation in the Middle East was evidenced.
The trade in “victors” in the cold war has thus turned to strengthening international terrorism.
After a series of tracts in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", please, there was no peaceful angle left.
Despite the general crisis, the West refuses to speak with Russia at the level of the equal partner.
Under such conditions, our country's only allies remain fleet and army.
The strengthening of military power will make Moscow more effective to halt national interests and move to new world policies.
Scotland's Kallum Skinner swims along the finish line, resulting in the British capture of bicycle gold
Scotlandn Kallum Skinner went to the triumph at a man's command stop on the train in Rio last night, resulting in the protection of his title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old teacher of Glazgo was in the role of the strongest one his friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and a young man proud of his history, walking on the finish line to win the New Zealand factory.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, won when Hoy declared the right to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did the trick again after they had humbly graduated from the six world champions on the track trains in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a specialist, Jamie Staff.
They did so once when Hindus appeared.
Hoya also created the wilderness that Kean Emady and Matt Krampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man with British coaches who saw the potential in Scotland, which was now realized.
Hendes, Kenny, champions with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner established an Olympic record of qualifications, but the rules were passed on to New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold medal.
Hendes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hendes went on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
She watched from her place as an invited BBC expert and took a look at Skinner, Kenny, and Hendez when they entered the pedagogue.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "That's a simple comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make my own name.
We set up an Olympic record in the finals and won the World Championships.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, Kenny and Hoy, Hendes, together with his brother, admitted that he had deliberately fallen onto the track after a failed start.
He later withdrew from the commentary, and there was no way to appeal from the UK's competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest triumph.
Hendes said, "I felt like London, with all the British flag of the tribunal."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many races with the world's name that winning the Olympics again was just boring.
This is one event, one gold medal for countries that won seven of the 10 named races both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the last five months, the bike will wait another five days.
With the form displayed by Kenny, it is not beyond the possibility of showing how he repeats Hoya's turn, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Game.
This would show how Kenny, who was born on March 23, at the age of 12, was born to Hoy, who was also born on March 23, (that is, the sacred date of British sport, also on the day of Steve Redgray, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), brought his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would be the same as Hoya.
The next time Kenny is in the morning, which begins today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old man from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Commanded encounters are always the best.
You come to win with your friends.
A little alone to win one if it's true.
Hendes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he's got to get the kingdom."
It was the only day of medallion, but the following good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Klansy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll have been the fastest four-mile rounds of persecution.
They won at 3:51.943.
The 2012 World Report on Gold Awards in London is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event where Wiggins will be right at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, a promotion of a qualifying mission when officials needed him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's activities, which are resumed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Russell Shend, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milangavi have improved the world record at 4:13.260.
The British Army has come to rely on a strong crew of passengers to take possession of the Olympic Games in the medium term and to hire a metal ball.
After extraordinary demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in progressive training for Rio.
There were dramas on the second floor, not the last of which was the resignation of the technical director, Shane Satton in April due to sexual harassment and anxiety, and the disappearance of large figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first night's ride on the bike, it seems that now the legendary glory of Great Britain is reaching the top in time, perhaps once again.
Future of the Portland Metallurgy plant, threatened by the break-up of the electricity contract
The future Portuguese aluminium plant in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company, which provides the premises, says one of the owners of the plant, is planning to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be broken.
This step is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the profession.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened by Alcoa in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be at risk as a result of any closure.
It can also have additional side effects, as the metallurgy plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgy plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
The Portland Metallurgy Company Alcoa loses its money and is in danger of closing.
These actions have resulted in reflections on the future of the profession, which have continued for several years, in particular because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later because of the prices for the production of the profession.
The AGL company, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latbo-Valli, reported that it was expected that the other three owners would also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling part of the project belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Aluminum, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubien Corp are less.
"AGL company expects that the Portland facility will continue to work, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgy industry will not cease," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called 'managed contracts' that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of separation, so they are actually ending in 2017.
" Accordingly, AGL still expects that these contracts will bring its share of income in the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
In any case, any potential impact on AGL's profits from the financial year 2018 has now been limited by the projections on the strong market for electricity prices.
The company AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of treaties in its accounts to $187 million in the form of “current dispute”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to cancel contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to manage the metallurgy plant or to provide electricity to the metallurgy plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
The analysts feared possible closure of both the Portland Metallurgy plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant, along with Nicolaslo because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL CEO Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megabytes of energy a year, while Tomago is about 900 megabytes a year.
If both of these jobs are marketed, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
It's going to be bad for us, as for the manufacturer," he said.
Not only the stars of the Cardian show, Candall on the September issue of the voice number
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, the model and fourth daughter of the Cardian-Generic mother manager Chris, appeared in the sealed September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand member of the Easte Lauder and defies fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this apartment and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the event was strange (or simply in the spirit of the "Cardian Family"?), produced a video, in which the entire Cardian-Jenner family (debossives Rob and Caitlin, also associated with the most popular show show show show show show, the founder of the "Cardian Family" Ryan Sykrest), forgot about the appearance of the sister on the scene, and finally the classic event: they planned a party surprise.
It's a standard coherent line of almost all episodes of child television shows, dedicated to the day of birth (Sikrest makes the phrase: "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with an honest multi-year queen from the program on the 8th of the morning), but Chris had to get that fame so or otherwise for other girls.
Because with this episode, dedicated to the number of September, we have certainly entered a new era of Cardian show.
Let older sister Kendall Kim and fall on Vogue earlier (she appeared on her with her husband Kanje West in April 2014), but the September issue is a self-evident achievement.
The September issue is the most sold by Vogue for the year.
A full look on the tax issue rather than on the fashion magazine attracted a large number of advertisements (by the fashionist port, 615 pages from the previous year's 832-page release).
News about those who fall from the stars are expected to be so impatient that in the last two years, the magazine has moved to the official anonymity.
Among the previous women who fell in the camp were Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been no doubt that there has been more awareness of models than those of those of those who are nominals.
Laurent's Oskar prize and brand face Dior Jennifer Laurences was presented on board in 2013, a year after the honour was given to Lady Gage.
But even in that small case, if Jenner, who described the magazine as a “extraordinary model ” of his generation, falls into the first category, she is in a bad company.
They are not relatives of famous people, reality stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (that is, Jenner falls into all of these categories).
They are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Bionse, which appeared on the previous occasion, this year was one of the most successful careers in the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not all are happy with Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, because of her past TV show, has always been shocking.
In June, one of the first models Victoria's Secret Stéphanie Seymour described Jenner and her colleague, Giggy Hadid, calling them "sucking moments".
These attitudes were recognizable after the news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover.
But it doesn't make sense to be confused.
Candall Jenner on the September issue of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defending Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, even all her sisters, sells her photos to you in her own applications available on the payroll.
She sells pictures of the daughter of Cindy Crowford of LOVE.
And in free time, perhaps to see her sister, Courtney and her children, she participates in a TV show.
Community legal centres have declined to serve 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 minimum population protection representatives refuse to serve in public legal centres, as this sector is preparing for an effect that will lead to further funding for and so on.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, defenseless workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight injustice and who are still in need of legal assistance and representation — have been denied.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope are being prepared for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres have lost 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that, according to the last census of the National Association of Social Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only deteriorate.
"The main legal centres in Queensland have always received insufficient funding: that is, thousands of people are denied the essential services they need," he said.
People who are victims of violent attitudes, people with uncontrollable and disunited debts, families who have been divorced and who have been unjustly fired — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government will finance 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis to immediately cancel these cuts so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State had fulfilled its obligation to raise funding for free legal assistance to the country ' s average rate.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and to the Government of Palaštuk for this important work.
Donald Trampa was placed in court at the pre-election headquarters, after the alleged threat of a gun had been made by a staff member.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trampa was brought to court at the pre-election headquarters: it is claimed that the headquarters did not take anything after the announcement that his operational director in North Carolina threatened a gunman when they were on their way to jail in February.
The incident was described in a court case filed in the middle of the state court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, former programme director at the State Pre-Trial Office.
Bordine said he waited a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized that "that's not going to happen."
Director Erl Phillip "takes a gun, puts his right index finger on the cigarette and puts a bullet on Vincent's knee,” says Bordine in a complaint.
In his appeal to the local and regional management of the Pre-Trial Chief, Bordini understood that at least four others had been involved in similar incidents with Philip.
"The guns don't have to shoot to cause damage," Bordine said in her complaint.
It took place two days after a candidate from the Republican party produced a forum, told the North Carolina audience that “people of Second Amendments” understood as owners of arms and their fans could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and the judges could be elected.
The Pre-Trimpa Chief said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In her complaint, Bordini called for compensation from the head office for non-interference and from Philippi for the threat of physical violence, abuse of action and the cause of moral harm.
The representative of Trapa Hoop Hicks medley responded to the request for a comment.
The attempts to communicate with Philip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to the call to his consultancy firm, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one called immediately.
The candidate from the Republican party, Donald Tramp, has conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the High Court of the District of Melbourne, Charlotte.
Britain must send the Olympic Spirit to the required root and expand Hitler
Hitler will also bring revenge and prosperity not only in our former settlements and in general London, but throughout the country.
Like me, it was the great privilege of Hitler, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to benefit our peoples and regions from the Games.
The Olympic Games benefited greatly from Stratford and East India.
And we're doing this again, creating opportunities for local residents and a company with Hitler.
Only for our current population, we will create 10,000 new stations, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to the youth unemployment in the airport.
As had been before London in 2012, those who think that Hitler's expansion is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we are in a difficult position on the world arena.
Sceptics have failed in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Hitler.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitler is responsible for any issue he has to deal with.
Like the Olympic Games of Hitler, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both within the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a beautiful team in Hitler, which has introduced the 11 billion-dollar infrastructure investment programme at the same time and within the budget, from T5, selected by the best airport terminal five years ago, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two largest airfields.
They are now ready to provide a third air-conditioning area, approved by 16 billion private investment funds.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London have been a great success for Britain, and I am sure that the enlargement of Hitler will also be.
It is time for us to send the Olympic Spirit to the required roses and expand Hitler, to ensure our trade future, and to develop the skills and jobs that Britain will be able to achieve.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Hitler and the former Trade Father of the Qualifications
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing in the "tocks" about blocking advertising
For companies who earn money on the Internet, attempts to cover software for blocking advertising are a game in the "tocks" of a company that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ads on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change its area of advertising so that blockers would find it more difficult to identify which parts of the pages are advertising.
But Adblock now says he could wear a new code.
In his blog release, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “a kind of mutual struggle between the community of blockers of advertising with an open source code and those who are trying to cover it is continuing from the time of the release of the advertising block” and that Facebook might present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the biggest social network in the world has been involved is a clear indication of how serious the problem has become the blockade of advertising for industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people are using advertising blockers, according to the past year's survey of Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users entering Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of Facebook's income.
However, the company is urged to block commercials on the desktop, as mobile advertising blockers are not effective in Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, as the representative said.
However, the advertising in the so-called version is a good-looking article that Facebook has made such a good investment.
On Thursday, Facebook also announced that it was about to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how the advertising is being directed.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters were worrying, as they would also block some unannounced content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planning to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
The advertising blockers are a serious tool, so we have focused on the creation of tools such as Advertising Preferences to transfer governance to people.
Women moved to the Swiss highway in an apparent suicide episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a number of vehicles were transferred to the highway early on Thursday in an attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 port of Morz in Canton shortly after midnight in Thursday.
The woman was on her way in the darkness of despair, and she was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Apparently, a number of vehicles, including a truck, were hit by a suicide victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49.
She died on the spot.
Several intruders have already been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, reported to the police, calling them and to anyone else who was a witness to the event.
A criminal case, a “logic” step in this situation, was initiated by Jille Hoffsetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it still needs to be made clear whether any of the leaders involved will be charged.
Was it possible to escape the attack?
This is what the prosecutor must determine," Hofsetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years have led to the assumption that drivers will not be recognized as responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the darkness on the road — a judgment was made that car drivers cannot expect an accident meeting on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was justified by the death of an unattended person after she struck and killed a man on the A1 at the Piern Valley in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drunk and lost consciousness on the road, listening to the court.
The court found that a police woman, who had responded to extreme challenges, managed a vehicle that was justified, and that the existence of a man on the road was “fully exclusive and unforeseeable”, the judge said.
Anyone who has information on the event in the fourth direction of the Sea must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once promised
Venus, perhaps, was once dedicated, according to the assessment of the new NASA climate model.
Students from the Nassau Institute for Space Research developed a model for research in the past of Venezuela using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatelogists.
The model was designed to determine whether it could be found in Venezuela with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere overheated by carbon dioxide whenever conditions such as land exist.
The students had previously assumed that the small return rate of Venus was due to its flat atmosphere.
But the latest model suggests that Venus could probably have a detached atmosphere like that of the earth, and that everything would return slowly.
The model also considered the topography of earlier Venezuela.
The planet is likely to have more dry regions than on Earth, but sometimes enough water and sufficient geographical change to create conditions for life and prevent rapid recovery.
Early Venezuela also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent of the sugarcane.
"In accordance with the GISS model, the slow return of Venus represents its day-to-day side of the sun almost two months away," explained a press release from GISS Anthony Del Heno.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a whole layer of clouds that acts as a zone that protects the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are, as is surprising, at a few degrees colder than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously envisaged by planetary experts.
Despite the fact that Venus may have been promising, it has been affected by too much noise and ultraviolet radiation over the course of several billion years.
Its oceans were disintegrated, and her water mate was subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
When her water flowed, only a flat atmosphere of carbon dioxide left with the deadly greenhouse effect was left — it is Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venezuelan climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the position of trainer of the Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left the trainer post and vice-president of the hockey movement Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, noting the lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice-president / Chief Commander of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new trainer immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as the chief coach and vice president of the hockey movement Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I had been thinking deeply about how I could improve this command to give her the depth she needed and raise her to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of the hockey movement must be ideally aligned with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sakik, who won Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we want him to succeed in the future.
Roy became the winner of Jack Adams Award as the best lichen trainer during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 eyes and won the Central Division, but Colorado was rocked in Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and left for five hours from the Wild team to fight for a second profitable trip to the Western Conference.
He won four Cuban Stanleys, two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil is renegotiating negotiations and ceases to strike
The oil wages cuts in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are beginning a new round of negotiations reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
The arrests against the oil company Wood Group were held on platforms in the North Sea under Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unit and RMT Unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, beginning with the next week to take a fresh look at the problems.
The unions reported that their recent action, which, they said, was first over 25 years old, was directed against potential cuts of payments by up to 30 per cent.
In this year, the Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract servants working in the North Sea, about 9 per cent due to the negative market pressure.
The decrease in company rates occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rate for marketed service workers in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would provide it with the space needed to overcome market failures.
The Shell company, by its side, has reduced thousands of people and has announced plans to stop the activities in the countries of up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-silence with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices for crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to leave the European Union, which was adopted in June.
The Scottish Parliament member, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the greatest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the star's return to the Pled.
The last mission of the space telescope Kepler has helped astronomers to collect the full directory of the speed of the return of the stars in the Pled.
New data help astronomers understand why stars return at different speeds and how the periods of return relate to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that, compared with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of stars, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Riball, a researcher at the Centre for Infrared Treatment and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Plejad is located in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars are now only grown; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're coming back as fast as they'll never be again.
At its peak rate of return, these rising stars emit large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through magnetic fields of stars, these winds give the stars a powerful act.
As the star gets older, its rate of return begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of return of each star, following the time between known stars — such as the sun’s five.
The new rate of return is expected to be lower than that of mass stars.
Ribabal compares the stars with the dancers: the pirates do more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the "battle" landscape, we observe that those who return slowly, usually more massive, whereas those who return faster, usually belong to a very light star," said Ribabal.
Just as the Pleda is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare its relationship with the speed of return.
"Pladay's outdoors provide a starting point for the theoretical models of the return of stars, both young and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars slow down their return and push on their "tantic tufts", as they say.
Ribabal and her colleagues have detailed their final analysis of the speed of the return of the Plejad in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
The investigation involving the activities of a group of Ukrainian dissidents in Crimea is conducted by two departments, Kommersantt.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of the divisions in Crimea.
As was previously reported, the Ukrainian city ' s inhabitants, Energodar Evgeni Panov, agreed to cooperate with the result.
In his statement, he considered Titan's chemistry in Armenia, the Neftebaz in Feodosia, the Kercenian paramour, gas pipeline, and one of the military airports.
The defenders believe that detention has been far away from all factions of the difference.
This, in particular, served as a basis for arrest of suspects at the Simferopol Court of Kiev.
The head coach of the Russian football club became Stanislav Churchesov
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the head coach of the Russian football club Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract will be calculated for two years before the end of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS appointed the head coach of the Russian Federation football team Stanislav Cherchesov.
He was a well-known football player, formerly played in Moscow's Spartake in the backyard position, as well as a solid trainer who was a leader of Russian teams such as Spartak, Jemchugina-Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinamo, and the Warsaw League, who became the winner of the national predominance and the country's Cuba.
It is reported that the contract with the Church will be signed in the near future and will be counted for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romaštenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov, will come to his training headquarters.
There is information on which the total payment of the train station will amount to 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the Media, the leadership of the RFS has set before Stanislav the Church's goal of bringing Russia together to the semi-final and conquer the medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considered the creation of a competitive environment in the team and was going to give footballers the opportunity to show themselves.
And, according to Cherchesov, he's happy that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of the Church of Russia will be held on 31 August in Antalia, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, former position of the Russian football coach, Leonid Sluckey, who worked with him as a coach in the CSCA club.
He expressed his concern at the post following a preliminary statement by the Russian National Team at Euro-2016 in France.
In addition, he took responsibility for the bad results of his collection.
Despite the threat between Angola and the U.S., Namibia suffered a great deal during the long fight against apartheid.
Nevertheless, after the fall of independence from South Africa in 1990, that country has achieved enormous success in 2.4 million people, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries recognize themselves as being free-of-charge and secondary education, in many poor countries in middle and even primary schools, education is required.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to provide training for “costing”.
In Namibia, however, primary schools are free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has been free of charge.
The authorities also work actively in other important areas.
Malaria destruction efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Despite the international trend of inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 indicator, the Gini coefficient, which was the standard indicator of income inequality, was reduced to 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased, from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest level of freedom of expression in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders data.
The United States and other wealthy States have been significantly affected by the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Corruption Recovery Index, composed of Transparency International human rights defenders.
Even now when prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain high rates of growth.
At the same time, the debt ratio for GDP is approximately 25%, with less than 1/3 debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least by traditional methods of assessment, remains high enough - almost 28 per cent.
As with other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is almost 17 per cent infected.
According to the World Bank estimates, Namibia is one of the above-average countries, but authorities insist that their State is, in fact, a developing country.
Namibia is certainly faced with some of the challenges facing the weak developed economies.
The State has to develop a very large and fragile country with a small population.
In the territory of the country, isolated clans of harvesters live in deserts, which must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
The integration of people who have been in the world economy for the past four centuries is a challenge for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: just like any other country in the world, it is faced with the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to let go of hands, the country was facing the problem.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were involved in the creation of a diverse economy and a contiguous society.
It is noteworthy that the competing political factions gathered together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides adequate medical care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbors.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to medical institutions in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia spoke of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians understood that the neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and to exchange students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia had rightly concluded that the rich natural resources could easily become a curse by helping to discourage many.
The authorities understand that the income from Namibia ' s natural wealth needs to contribute to infrastructure and productive capacities.
They also realize that it would be inappropriate not to seek the maximum income from the country ' s sale of resources and to review investment laws and contracts for income in order to make sure that it is.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support for the Government of freedom of speech is so important.
As noted by the head of the Hage Gangbo State, the media often say that he does not like it.
But after fighting freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, the president said.
Not all the key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are related to renewables, and the Government is making every effort to maintain and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country each year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious deficiencies - racism, colonialism, inequality and low level of development - may be on the way to general development.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and support.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna — the earliest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
Unfortunately, this was the worst archaeological sensation in the 1970s: a fantastic number of gold artifacts — more than three thousand total weights of 6 kilograms — were found in Bulgaria.
Only one burial known as "Mogilla No. 43" was pulled out of 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the former gold of the world could soon turn to the invisible type of bus discovered by archaeologists in July of this year.
I'm going back to Bulgaria, in a logistic village known as the Tel Unazite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, the Tel unacids were set off from the sea, along the village of the Union of the Pazardian region.
The bus is a golden pole, turned into a wheel.
Nivor Bajjiev, director of the excavation at Tela unacitte, updated 4600 years before our era and stated that it was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
Varna's tomb is remembered for about the same period, 4400 to 4200 years before our era.
The technology that allows for the detonation of metal is currently not available.
How, then, can you be sure of what gold is?
Apparently, Professor Badjiev knows more than Reuters reported: "I'm absolutely sure that the gold of the United Nations is older than the gold of Varna."
This is an extremely important finding: in the light of this brief object, but it is large enough to take a similar place in history.
In the interview, Reuters revealed that scientists are currently analyzing the composition of the metal, as well as to re-examine the archaeological layer, where gold artifacts have been found.
This will help to fix the bus with as much accuracy as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell the United Nations is a great village, even if you never heard of it.
At present, the Tel Unazite is considered to be the ancient "city" of Europe.
The Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th century B.C.E.
Over the next few centuries, metal processing has developed rapidly in the region, from the development of first metallurgy skills to the creation of a fully-valued industry.
There is a special name in the native history of this archaeological community: the Balkans-Carpathian metallurgy province.
In the five thousand years before our era, the metal processing centres began to be inhabited by the city type.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
One of these may have been the oldest, since the artifacts were found here in 4400 B.C.E.
I would call Tel Unazite a prototype of the modern city, although it is a very old village, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the oldest place in Shumera for a thousand years," says Badjiev, bearing in mind the general belief that the city culture was born in southern Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the natural sense of the word.
The battle of the United Nations will take place in 1976.
At the time, archaeologists dug nearly 12 acres [12 ha], about a third of the total population.
The remains of the wall were found, which sometimes reached a height of three feet.
From the houses and masteries there was little left, but archaeologists clearly distinguished streets, public buildings, urban flats, business centers and residential areas.
The United Nations Tel is often referred to as the bird town: there were dozens of naked bird figures.
All birds were represented in a room, from here it was assumed that they were not decorative objects but the object of local culture.
The bird town was destroyed about 4400 B.C.E. by the Indonesian tribes that came from the north-east.
There were no castles, so there were no guns and no guns.
The three-metre stairwell walls did not stop them.
The archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of violent warfare: the remains of the elderly, women and children with wounds caused by war camps have been found inside.
New findings and new facts are presented annually, and I am familiar with the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about certain cultures, but about the "poterate" of Europe's first civilization born in the Balkans.
The search for this civilization has been a powerful incentive for the golden Varna, found relatively recently, in 1972.
It's reasonable that Varna's green gold had to go ahead of something -- something like the little gold bus created in the United Nations Tel.
In Porsche, the model 911 Targa has been artificially met
It is officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted manually by specialists of the units working with serial machines.
Retro-Luk, for example, is a special colour of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for Porsche 356B model, and even the logo of the model.
In addition, the market has received a company's white chart along ships and special 20-inch RS Spyder driving discs, as well as some of the details of the design of the cubes of the "white gold metal".
In the retro-square, it is less significant: it is, in large measure, the sero-synomas of formation, the new grids with expanded electro-regulatory ranges, and the separate black anodized table with the unit's logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a glass gift for the car and a rich album with photos of the production process.
The strong establishment of the Porsche Exclusive specialist has not been achieved: the retro-market of characteristics is entirely consistent with the series.
It is equipped with six-cylinder engine with a turbo-dwelling capacity of 3.0 L, which develops 420 C.E. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with a limited tape, but no value of each specific player is reported.
Facebook and bloggers have launched a "arm race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the cover of ads on the websites, has prompted decision-makers to block the advertising of responses.
AdBlock Plus has issued an "opposite" but Facebook plans to do it soon.
So AdBlock Plus announced its new technology, which will, most recently, remain effective.
The representatives of the Council noted that, in an attempt to deceive the new "unblocked" advertising technology, the decision of AdBlock Plus, together with commercial declarations, also blocks many regular posts from friends or sites.
On Facebook, they expressed regret for this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source of the TechCrunch edition, a code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be ready for the next few hours.
Thus, smokers and blockers have developed their kind of “arms race”, trying to impress each other, while the injured party has become users who have lost interest in their friends or who have seen advertising where they have not been accustomed to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blockage of advertising have recently been fueled by heated disputes.
In Murmansk, a rapist will appear before the court.
His case had already been investigated at the Russian Federation's Follow-up Committee on the Murman area.
The charges against 54-year-old men are very serious.
Finally, it was found that at the end of November 2015, Paulova was charged in the Murmansk street area with sexual violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sentence of this article provides for maximum punishment for deprivation of liberty for up to six years.
Dongfeng brings it to Russia Crossfenguan Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - roulem www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing popularity of China ' s category of cars, which combines the dignity of mine and crosswords.
Another Russian Prime Minister was a pickup of Rich New.
Many western companies of the Moscow International Autosolans have decided to ignore this year, so the empty Cross Expo exhibition halls will be filled with Chinese companies.
In particular, the strong front will be the Dongfeng Motor company, which has a wide range of Russian markets and is intended to offer our car owners a number of interesting news in the near future.
One of them is Crossven Dongfeng Fengguang 370, who has been sold in China at the price of 55,900 June (about 550,000 rubs at the current rate).
To the Russians, it is almost too light to ask about the delivery in our country as long as it is in the course of the discussion.
In China, however, Fengguang 370, as a result of June's sale, has arrived at the 11th place in the list of the most sold mines, although with a large road education (175 mm) and a protective plastic load under the lower perimeter of the kitchen, it can be counted as a crosswords.
Crosswen was built on the front platform of the Fengguang 360 model, at 370th of the same railway base in 2725 mm, but the cubes were slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design of the solid and the supply of the treasure.
Salon was decorated with wooden plans, but a large vertical sensor screen “like Tesla” on the central console was only on the early cross-vehicle exhibits, and the "music" machine was sold easier.
Five of the seven basements are easily built, forming a 1650 mm floor floor, with a maximum thickness of 1500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is equipped with one - 1.5 litres of petrol "atmospheric" power in 115 C.E., meeting with a 5-point mechanical transmission box.
With regard to the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer humbly reduces, so he promises a stable budget of 6.7 L/100 km.
Picap Rich New is well - known for the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the late generation, but with a number of Chinese stylers equipped with design.
Despite the moral ageing structure, this model is still used as a stable demand for a Chinese consumer as a reliable and unencumbered "workable waste".
At the same price as Rich New, the farmer is also interested in Russians, as modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose: gasoline 2.4 L (137 C) or turbodiesel 2.5 L (116 C).
The transfer box is only a mechanical, leading to the rear wheel, but there are modifications and with a strictly defined "pretence".
It will be at Dongfeng's stand and a new Flagman's A9 seat, whose Russian Prime Minister announced his presence in June.
The average crossovers on the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest newspapers - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian line Dongfeng consists of two models: S30 seat and H30 Cross.
In seven months of this year, the Chinese companies' dealers were operating 696 cars in our country.
Reports on the transport tax will cease to be sent by email at www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the order of sending notice on property taxes.
All Russian car owners have been accustomed to a scheme that has not changed over the past year: they are received by mail at the cost of transport taxes over the previous year.
However, this year many will not be hungry.
The fact is that the tax inspection, without any noise, has changed the notice order of the citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Home Office of the Payer" on the official website of the nalog.ru department will receive reports in electronic form.
In inspections, such Russians were automatically identified by online users and deleted from the standard "bumous" broadcast.
The majority of the owners of vehicles and mobility are affected.
All the rest will continue to receive the usual letters.
In addition, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available to the account holders on the site.
To that end, they will have to visit the tax office in August and write a statement.
On the one hand, a new order is more modern and comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the appointment, when the letter will come within a few days and may be lost at all.
The increase in the number of Internet users of the Tax Inspection Service exceeded 18 million, making it possible for the Government to record a substantial amount of money on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the change in order.
Some may have been registered in the "personal office" to receive a uniform service and have long forgotten it.
These people will not receive reports at all, and they themselves will fall into the category of non-payments with all the resulting consequences.
Access to the Payroller's Personal Office is provided in three ways: through the account of the Port of Gossulgi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any tax inspection department (in spite of the decision-making position).
We recall that the transport tax has to be paid by 1 December this year.
The hearing began in July.
The Tunisian Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the preparations are aimed at achieving a very high performance, is something in itself.
However, the controversial concept did not upset G-Power's masters who took advantage of the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its access to BMW cars, but no human master is foreign.
