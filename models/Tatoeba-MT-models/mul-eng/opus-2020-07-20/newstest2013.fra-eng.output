A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by fire.
In addition, the Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is that these new provisions will negatively influence the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly affect the American democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, American States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this sense that a majority of American governments have promulgated new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took place after the November 2010 elections, which were expected to add 675 new Republican representatives to 26 States.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require the voters to present an identity card with photos and evidence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods by precipitation, invalidate the right to vote as electorate on the day of the election and withdraw citizens with a judicial record of their voting rights.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities committed themselves to extending this practice to other States.
In the past two years, they have produced draft laws in 34 States to force the voters to submit a photo identity card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
But it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the required identity card.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities, and low income.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of those who earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of the 18-29-year-old voters do not have the required identity card.
All right.
Students, elected voters considered to be more voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photos issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more closely with the Republican side to vote for the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, dozens of States have adopted laws calling for voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the Spanish vote.
However, it appears that two Spanish electors on three favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011 Republican legislators passed laws requiring electoral registration on the day of expulsion in eight States.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to be enrolled.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures taken since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by precipitation.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13 per cent of the State's voters.
He did the same with the Spaniards.
These were only 11 per cent of the voters, but 24 per cent of the citizens voted in favour.
On the other hand, the whites who formed 76% of the electors represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting electoral registration.
Several legislative projects have been blocked by the vetos of democratic rulers.
The General Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the submission of a photo identity card.
However, the new rules in place will inevitably make the exercise of voting rights more difficult in 2012.
Democrat criticisms claim the partial character of the laws that have been voted and have clearly been aimed at influencing the results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly affect the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer diagnosis: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes produce wrong results, with false or even negative results, resulting in useless medical interventions.
What makes men more reluctant to pass exam tests?
Whether or not to pass the test?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among Witness groups, so it was difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a diagnosis and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up of 12 years, that between 30 and 40% of the chances of having metastases were not determined.
I therefore recommend testing from 50 years or 40 years if there is a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
The men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other people who are uncomfortable.
It is true that the patient needs to understand the risk of his or her cancer by offering the possible options, not necessarily treating the prostate cancers that do not lead to long-term life, but rather, in these cases, to active disease monitoring.
Today, many people who detect cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to be active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be provided with treatment.
In addition, the criteria for determining who should or should not be dealt with are precisely defined.
So I'm recommending you even pass the test.
But it is important to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember created a tool that allows for and against the APS test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," notes André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a big night for people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Comforting data: 10 years after smoking, the risk of death from a drop in half.
The weights
Embonpoint and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increased the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophageal, pancreas and uterior cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against lung cancer," it adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it reduces the risks of reaching a colorectal cancer.
Caruters too, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of the meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter may damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," it is explained.
The vitamins
Over the past few years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not final for the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established no longer.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family background with his doctor.
"To pass a screening test, it doesn't give the cancer."
The Higgs Box Decortic
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created an emotive, the last summer, and for cause.
We believe that this botanist participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then it's about the last particular existence predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "lower" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it's still not absolutely sure that it's about Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have a real new particular one, and that it is very similar to the Higgs box foretold by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still no data available to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that it's good for Higgs, because the chances of cheating seem less, and see what it's doing.
In this low world, there is a pretty unconquerable law that wants two things not to be found in the same place at the same time.
You can't break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even if the physics of particles is a very strange world, it appears that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which provides that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantity" - this "state" consisting of large mode in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists class the particles in two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens called farmers, who wisely obey Paul’s principle.
And in the other case, the bosses, a band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can be beautiful and well found in the same place at the same time.
These boons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, otherwise) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the moons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature advance and which the Higgs box would be in some way appear.
These bees, it needs to be highlighted here, are not all such exotic bees that we can believe.
In fact, if you are able to read this Chronicles, it is thanks to a box of extraordinary balance: the photon, or the "lightpiece" that is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an accelerated electric load or a change of direction, it "deranges" the electromagnetic field in this specific area, a bit like a boiler launched in a stang.
From this "degradation" is an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photo - and therefore one of the "power-power-power-power-boxes".
Champ plus stable
It goes the same way with the Higgs box, to this difference as it is another field, the Higgs field, which has to be "described" so that this box appears.
But this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to highlight it, it needs to reach very, very high energy, as if it were a yellow wall, which only a very large rock could lift the surface.
That's why a huge acceleration of particles like the one of the CERN - the Great Hadron Collider is a 27 km of conference! - to reach such energy.
Analogue with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
This is not actually all particles, or all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never wear himself on a frigo.
And in the same way, this is not all the individuals who interact with the Higgs field: those who make it have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, container) do not.
Now, what is it that "can bring" all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to look at the differences between MS observations and predictions.
They are also several who wish to be found, because the smallest difference could open a door on a "physical novel" and blow some blocks of the Model.
This, it must be said, still has huge gaps, offering no explanation for gravity (ups!) or the matter of shadow, which forms about 80% of the universe's matter (re-ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on the day of Mr. and Mrs. All-The-World, they are more difficult to predict, but we would have to assume that they will not exist.
Keep in mind: at the beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories never doubted the revolution their work was about to begin.
They engaged in scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we already said the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who put himself at the point of the first continuous laser (the first were pushed), in 1962 - the laser was rather seen as a "labget".
Image...
And then applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
The same Willard Boyle, for example, made a small light capter in 1969, during his optical work.
This captain, although not of his original intention, is now serving as "oil" to all the world's digital cameras, and has valued the 2009 Noble of physics.
This does not necessarily mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... ▸ The Debor
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must take place gradually while a draft law is being prepared.
But in this important area, there is much to be done.
Deor tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that had bled him had left him for two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, mi-figue mi-rasin, extended in his bed to the Victoria-Gadbois palliative care house in Beloeil, where the guard arrived.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from becoming alone with the toilets, and even eating alone.
He agreed to let himself be helped to eat, redesigned.
Courageously, he even smiles, talks to strangers around him, brings his medications to him, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to fight the diarth, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our lives, we learn that a man, that's the first step," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's house.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
" This depends on the person ' s ability to accept regression, he noted.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place in the heart even of this recession.
Patients who visit the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the " team of doctors and nurses who do not care about " curatives".
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die " conscious and excited " .
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she added.
"I no longer wish in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help him breathe.
She is still waiting for her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor-Gadbois, we are produced with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
These are palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small when we know we're all done dying one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When you die, you will agree to produce oral care at Brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of daily life.
Yesterday night, we used a beer at Mr. X, dead during the night.
This morning, it's his son who will end the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"Helping the close as well as patients," says Natalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois's house, the days follow, but they don't look like them.
On the side of an 93-year-old man who attended his last family assembly in the court, well hidden in his ears while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying to survive.
" For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancers under 45 years of age, " concerned Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not simply have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or at home.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, are more or less specialized exclusively in the cancer care offered.
It is precisely this great lack of Quebecese health care that frightens several health professionals with palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed by summaries of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is circling to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebecese health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to palliative quality care before it is accepted for euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without doing what is needed to ease it.
I'm afraid patients don't ask to die because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's prospects for survival were already minimal when she left an experimental chemotherapy.
When I announced to my uncle that I had stopped the treatment, she answered that she regretted that I would stop fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was done!
No strong care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients who ask for death are grateful to the nurses that they have not responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to the Society of Palliative Care at the home of the Grand Montreal, patients would be refractory to treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors then often resort to palliative sedation, which returns to sleep until the moment of death, either in sporadic or permanently.
We can no longer do it as if we do not understand this part of suffering.
In addition, the unsatisfied disease will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to impress me " means " I want to be relieved " .
The implementation of this report has been made possible through a press conference of Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political and specialist fund collectors from the Italian Mafia are told every day what they know of a formal "system", which includes building industry, staff, politicians, unionists and mafiososo.
A " industry " that has been very expensive to Quebec's contributors, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is as curious as the system has been since we took the major means," ironic Jacques Duchesneau, who was a member of Quebec and former chief police officer of Montreal.
It was by him that the scandal was launched in 2011, by means of a thorough investigation into the abuses related to road work contracts in Quebec, where the first liberal minister of the day, Jean Charest, had agreed only to surrender.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, private financing and staff corruption.
"Since the start of the survey in 2010, he pointed out that the only transport department would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some reiterating their instincts to touch a share!
The Charbonne Commission "has already fallen two masters", he adds, hoping that it will "show the strategy behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also competes with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police than the "Marteau Scouade" who, since 2009, would have led Montréal's "Eggets' cartel" to put the gentle step on contract disputes...
Over the past few weeks, she has conducted a series of investigations and has brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town of Banlaw.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just been released from his third city of the capital of Laval, Quebec.
It is suspected that there have been repeated delays in the exchange of public contracts.
They are also formally accused by engineers on the road of Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
He himself spent 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for the years at an intermediate related to the Mafia that was reversing the money in the Montreal Union, part of the mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito was born in the year 2000, giving more than $88,000 Canadian dollars (about €68 000) to provincial parties, especially the liberals, then in power.
He also had organized an illegal fund collection for the former Liberian Prime Minister, Nathalia Normandeau.
Cost-of-expenditure contracts
In Montreal, the corruption system was functioning around.
Gilles Surprising, former public work engineer, has given the Commission a great deal of detail: in ten years, he has received gifts construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches, and he has been able to complete $736 000 in exchange for expensive rental contracts.
Other road officials have been known to burn the patent by 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the invoices, by extra fault.
Then an organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash with the silver of the hall.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay was released early in November, throwing Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Roulau was one of Montréal's first elections to draw the alarm.
Mother of Rivière-des-Prairies' arrondissement, east of the island, has risen from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land that bought $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate boom.
70% silver salinity in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that "it takes on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, filtered by furs, to stop the gangrene and push the fakes".
The process, she says, is "severe but positive".
We are about to clear the beach, but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, so as not to come back with questionable practices.
Like we do the wedding.
All right.
Jacques Duchessneau notes on his side that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he was concerned about the role of "elius in the course of the strike", when they didn't panic in the magic!
Considering 70% of the share of money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that this was not just a palace reflecting reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit contributions to the parties to $100, but this will not change the woman, he said: "As long as the electoral expenditure is not strictly limited, there will be political money."
He requested a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We can't go down any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow the house to be restored on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story preserves the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who wish to look at it in their own court...
"PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you took a new envelope with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual conscience but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements make me jump into my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't get excited.
From my start at the INFO Clearfontaine Preformation Centre on my journey to Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress through palies.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
Recruitments of this summer are used to discuss very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He's fired by supporters like Claude Makelele, who was playing at the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Anceloti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal in League 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hippie clubs.
He's got a lot of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What view do you have on the first part of the PSG season?
Ligue 1, Lyon took us the lead.
But we're staying in a hurry.
One of our major objectives is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8th finals in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say to very good European teams.
First, we want to finish our chicken first in front of Porto so we can get back on the 8th of the final return.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
He's already got the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to overcome titles and to be included in the duration.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to be fulfilled.
In Ligue 1, wouldn't winning the title, like last season, be a big mistake?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we're really going to be proud of this champion's title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have weapons to carry.
Do you think the media wait too much for the PSG?
It is normal to expect many of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We fully accept it.
Then, when we get 4-0 at home against Troyes and there's more things to do with us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We're asking what people expect more.
We'll never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built in time.
We've proven in League of Champions that we could respond.
See Manchester City that has not been able to qualify for the final 8th season for two months, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the investments, we would imagine you with 15 points ahead of the tree!
It was a failure of our opponents and the champion of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were "bootted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Link 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we will have the smile when we say that, despite all the difficulties, we have done so.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
That's better than saying there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Abrahamovic is very successful and that he has many goals.
He came for this and proved to be the star of League 1.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a global star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This moves others to set their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows the whole world to make progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I had to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing time.
I saw things there and I got strengthened.
Today, I am able to make good selection matches.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behavior.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the World Qualifications Group.
The picker is rigid, close to players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) drawn on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for the world.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between the parties involved.
Moreover, as in these technologies often, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the form of BitTorrent, which allows exchange of peer files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept cookies as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a $30 (€23) sum in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning to today around $10 (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual coin", "competitive with the dollar or the euro" and "like with conventional coins".
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual money such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that is being played or that it can be purchased (and sometimes exchange back).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
However, each time a central authority controls and deals with trades.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositors of the book of accounts, verifiers, monetary issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to make sure that sliced bits exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, like a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file extension phase, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "hacher" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special impression (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes make sure it's good.
The transaction is therefore indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, to deceive, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other orphanage because the two had different pressures.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also due to each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and warehouse Bitcoins have been stolen.
"The failure used does not relate to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who is about to launch Paymium, a real monetary payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also made money laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analysed the book of accounts and shows that nearly 80% of the Bitcoins are not around.
In November, "genetic soldiers" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been lost," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who becomes gold bits.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages more identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the marketplaces, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photographer and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, which ensures thousands of users.
There is a general motion for the return of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"The need for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a tournament," he said.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of success of this money.
We're part of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kaspisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are especially the Afghan countries that we have punished in regard to them as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 dead soldiers, and the wounded, mutilated.
Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former heads of refugees in Pakistan, but often countries that reject foreign military presence, such as the Soviet era.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by the Jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.
Tolerance, sometimes assisted by local insurers, will no longer be the case when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the high hills planted with French credits, was in order.
The trucks and tanks joined Kaboul without being attacked, overrun by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deployment on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistibly progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the country of fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscenity of these countries beyond the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Old Moudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main features of the anti-Soviet war came into force in 2001.
They have moved to Afghanistan, learning from government lands to relocate them to lands to build refugees who come from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from enormous American subcontracts of subcontracting.
They were disappointed; most of them did not fight themselves anymore.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, hope for a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have their share of the Americas: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They visited the modern world during their trips to Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kaboul now accounts for 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
Work will need to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscenity of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are portable telephones; television, and its Turkish pages, which present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state, as a powerful president, by removing the post of Prime Minister existing since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and so far, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been back on the road, no barrier is in place, no important irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country that had been destroyed by war for thirty years, government control on infrastructures would have been necessary.
The noise was revealed that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the West was just there to get rid of them.
No power to treat iron or copper mines on site, nor means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak's copper mine, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to exploit the vast Buddhist site and to remain the most important employees in the province.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to review normal reports.
The departure of French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: school of girls, boys, department of French at the University, French Institute, military cooperation, legal, medical and agricultural, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military action" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has been carried out by a small French NGO, a number of collective interest work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, hand-d-work gourmans, have been able to help contain the resurrection: irritation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cropable areas.
What will we remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve local living conditions, very hard in these values often more than 2,000 meters high.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the resurrection of foreign groups, what farmers have told me to do, they should maintain a small civil, well-controlled and direct approach to them.
A Constitution to Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, it has decided to play its all-way.
Taking the whole short-term world, he announced, Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two additional months to complete its work.
It is not long ago that Egypt supports a provisional text, many times it has changed what makes institutional stability fragile and leads to legal improbables.
This new initiative has only contributed to the increase in the country.
For his opponents, the President continues in his "autocratic deliberation", continuing to "tracle his word" and "detain the right".
On the other hand, it is ensured that it is a way to end it as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short time frame that forced the brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is widespread throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
As long as this appeal to a premeditated vote has been finalized to the people of Egypt: "You will vote for my text, or I will keep the full powers", they must be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this Constitution, to a large majority of Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals lacked the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had opened the door, believing that they had not been able to evaluate their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the quorum to be reached, 11 people, alternate members, were added to the heat, in the morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
Not surprisingly, it is most often the unanimity of the articles that have been voted.
Commentaries are also surprised by the fact that one of the only differences in the day has been expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the constitution was wrong.
The text, which was still voting yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all the attention, article 2 is finally identical to the 1971 Constitution, providing that "the principles of the Charia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which "the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, would hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a ghastly of their good will and of their respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," answered the liberarians, who saw only a cut of communication.
They believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with the Charia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing that "the people called are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of liberarians are also attached to the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the Civil State.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not obsessive but university students, for some of them formed in the French system" is Alexis Blueet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used are used for religious vocabularies.
There is reference to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic law, etc.].
And the question could be raised in the future to what extent civil judges are competent to do so."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticised because of the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Other point of view: the powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
There will no longer be a ban on civilian trials in military courts, as the human rights defence associations called for.
They are also part of their concern about the text, which they consider liberal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article no longer highlights the protection of women, notes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself on television last night, events were scheduled after noon.
The Head of State's support will disband them, Saturday.
In Israel, sacred places, the World Centre and a Samurai Sea await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the abundance of Bible truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Facty has held five major reasons to return to Israel.
Share in the Worship of the Holy Place
Make yourselves uncircumcised: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who paints these "baptismal funds" will be affected by the divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus ’ miracles: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus goes into the water, where he shows the storm or again where the fish was miraculous.
This is exactly where Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
Those who believe and walk along the Way of the Souffres or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretourary), where the process has been carried out, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the Onion and the burial.
This is where we find the Christian center of the world, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is built in the place where it grew the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentation, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A. J.-C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then quoted.
Move Up
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, an ancient refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 Av. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the broken rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only the amateurs of alpineism can make it through their own means.
For others, a telephony includes them on this full history summit.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 metres high, is the ski station of Mount Hermont, which hosts many tourists during winter.
A boat can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski tracks take up to 45 km long.
The old beliefs want the gods of the country to have used the summit of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
It's impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are five of the most interesting things that really matter.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It opens the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Jewish Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Art Museum.
The tools of the printer and expressives Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are presented mainly.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths made up of moulages of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Rally Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There's no guide or memory store.
The entry is free and the gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel Aviv, which comes back on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, which is built at the memory of 1.5 million disabled children in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You're going in there and you're in total darkness.
It's brilliant stars.
You then understand the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they are killed.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health and well-being
The three large railway stations in Israel are located on the rivers of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, delfinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even the winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year.
In this respect, it is the most unique sea in the world: it covers the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below the sea level.
The water of acid color contains the sauce and keeps the bananas very easily, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are a surreal beauty.
It is used to treat salty water, lemon, curative tubs and to treat different diseases such as dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply to slow down.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It is through the famous Via Maris that links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of the Antiquities.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to your "your" sign, the fate will tear you down.
In Jaffa you can cross young married couples who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to fight in the Roman theater, "conquering" the strength of the Croissians.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is today used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Noting Tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is best to prefer the dollar to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shells (now $1 equivalent to 3.8).
For urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast road and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, composed of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funnel.
The route in all types of common transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes at 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition meant to celebrate the Sabbath on the Sabbath.
On Friday evening at sunset, the markets, shops and public transport stop.
And the work week starts tomorrow morning.
Many coffees, restaurants and hotels serve only the household food, which excludes porridges, sea fruits, fish without scales and dishes made of both milk and meat.
There is a variety of dishes based on pineapple and boulevard, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also on manus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, molluscs, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs wrong in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of good food cats that smell the hot air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of the cars.
These falsifiers love the past places, and they don't just reject them.
The rental of a car varies from $37 per 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audio A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the cost-effective museum averages 30 shekels.
The Language of Digits
Three million tourists around the world visited Israel in 2012.
It consisted mainly of people who had come to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land by October 2012, or 51 per cent more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"What language is there in Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists are complaining about what the mandatory language test law will provide, certified counterfeiters have already made their appearance in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must undergo a Russian examination.
For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sales sector.
In time, however, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of language will need to be validated, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will need to validate its linguistic knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are excluded.
Persons who received certificates or educational diplomas before the fall of the RSS in 1991 are no longer covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitude and protection of rights
The review centres will be under the auspices of the Russian language institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of Saint Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to conduct examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Domain and the Federal Migration Service.
However, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have asked the question in the press many times: what will it give?
What is the obligation to know the Russians will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migrant service will be able to reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak of the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will allow 90 per cent of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems are for migrants without vocational training, for those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev's certainty is that the future migrants are destined to cross the path of honesthearted people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his likes will be tortured for months without food and without paper and will have to travel between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken by their passport, and they are not affected by the expected wage," the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who want to earn money in Russia are confident that they not only know the language of the country they want to become, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
This is certainly not their fault, but their grief: little Turkmens, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can be allowed to follow if only a primary teaching is passive.
In fact, their families don't even have to feed their children without telling them to talk to them properly and to equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adulthood, these young people are going to earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when we don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel reduced and loved."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be directed only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without a status, there will be no formal review or formal work at the same time.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Come in or defend your entry"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the cost of money legislization: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, we can get a wrong recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, where the cases of expulsion are.
"They're asking us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy from cigarettes, the tea," said journalist Oumed Khouchkadamov, from Tajikistan.
" Hurry up, don't lesin and buy you a beautiful work of art"
Since the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it has been found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by the federal migration service staff.
False paper comes out of an ordinary printable color.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the work of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the worker moving three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree to say that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "paper sheets".
The authorities may grant migrant workers who have not been able to verify the examination of the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not concerned with the arms market.
Part of the crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to enforce the law against the perpetrators of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is a divorce or a murder organized by Moscowian lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has committed seven deaths.
The police want to ban the port of firearms in cash in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the permit for arms at 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the Customs of the United States shortly.
The whole world is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by closing the visa.
An open letter appears on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demand to abandon "this insensitivity".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, declared to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and a specialist in the BBC crime.
According to the Statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in 2012 with a fire-fighting weapon in police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, any weapon for a reasonable price can be found in Moscow today.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the office
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are the number of five, reports Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot taken from a site using gun commands
The first is "the military track", that is, the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those that are captured by criminals by the forces of the order.
Baranettes explains that there are both weapons flying in police stocks and those stolen directly from police officers.
The illegal pistols are on sale since the military warehouses.
Many of these last days have often suffered explosions.
"The certified versions indicate that some fires have been fired in order to offset the deficit," explains the former military leader.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons tools that do not compete with competition on the international market and they learn weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is opposition.
An important part of guns and ammunition comes from poor countries, such as the Kirghizie.
"There is local production, sometimes artificial, a mafia formed and organized supply," adds the former military.
Where are the guns coming from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for Problems Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists have analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminal records and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explaining the researchers, came from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons on the black market have been found "in the absence of employees whose work is related to weapons", explained the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from military conflicts, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5 per cent are out of "clandese fools".
A salesman and consultant who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that no one has long been buying the weapons found by these clendatine crowd specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for new goods in military stores.
The person buys by means of a teaching unit, for example a TT gun.
We'll let him go through the march through a grill.
"He transports it to the city and resale it for 900 € per unit with two carriers," he relates.
"It is true that the police are in charge of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be eliminated, it carries out a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," adds the seller.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are generally found by means of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy appeared and offered me to come to Begovaya's station where someone was supposed to take me to a "coin" to march.
The gun price, it's given me on the spot.
Victor Baranets in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explain to the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are salesmen on the markets, but there is also a need to come by saying, for example, "From the part of such a person who asked me to send his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American points with the help of someone I trust.
He's just giving it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
The young are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, he says, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "all we wanted".
"I believed in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't like buying, go with the forest vendor, and set a target.
"I'm let go and when I'm sure the gun goes well, we start negotiating," says the expert.
A bottle from his couch
The search engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where "for different uses" weapons can be purchased.
There is no document and no person to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," wrote in a publication on the site "Buy a gun or a fight machine".
Users leave their application and ask their questions.
And we're selling to minors?
"Unauthorized, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"Fedorenkov" in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated an immense network of false sites and has set out to protect people who wish to buy weapons of war.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves using coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, Observer and Former Military
I heard about this type of scheme: the site is generally registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment on the automatic bags.
"He gets back a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying for the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated an immense network of false sites and has set out to protect people who wish to buy weapons of war.
"People run on food as hungry wolves and then find themselves using coal in Siberia," he said.
A 100-dollar Makarov
The purchase of an illegal firearms weapon, especially experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to an Army", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It comes from long-term deposits managed by these medium-sized deposits.
According to the official data of the Department, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent and rose to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of armed robbery, munitions, explosives and bombings decreased by 7.8 per cent.
U.S. employees of fixed-food and supermarkets are in trouble
Near a quarter of American teenagers pass through a caste job at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests is mounted against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take the width or disappear quickly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages of basic employees in Walmart and fast recovery channels, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get trade unions created.
This sector is not for the moment covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanking, the "Black Friday", when a rising flow of money poured millions of residents down to America and sometimes set off from aliens.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their jobs to organize snacks with trade unions and left-wing workers in companies whose products are intended for consumers of moderate and medium-sized classes.
Walmart commercializes everything: cassette-guns by passing by car batteries, aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products are 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees paid at Walmart do their courses only on their jobs.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart can be allowed to sell its products in the best way, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of lifts or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Vendredi Black" demonstrations demanded an increase in pay, and they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 per hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
The scientists at the University of California in Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary by $12 billion, it would cost $3.2 billion.
It's 1.1% more than it's currently spending.
If Walmart would transfer all the increase in wages on consumer shoes, each course in the store would pay them 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 a year more than now.
Walmart's parties were pleased to note that protests had taken place in only nine States and had no harm to the group.
The "Vendredi black" continued in stores at 8:00 a.m. the following evening and Walmart sold 5,000 articles on this period to the second.
Its caches have carried out 100 million transactions for the "Vendordi Black".
Dan Fogleman's address in an interview at Huffington Post's left-hand site was that at least five Walmart's employees had left their posts and that protest was only a "com-operation of so many others" on the part of the organization union.
"Next Client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and no longer dealt with Walmart stores (in this progressive town, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other restaurants are well marketed.
McDonald's announces to sell billions of pieces and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you've done honestly!
Jumanee Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum salary provided for by federal legislation and New York is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food increases them over time, but a little, averagely, its basic employees touch New York $8.90 per hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it's unthinkable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school while living at their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income there or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal's forum there are comments that it is not responsible for making children if you don't know what to eat with.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food cooks and cooks be paid at least $15 a.m., or double the current minimum wage.
They also requested that trade unions be created in the fast recovery sector.
The U.S. Act prohibits the administration from making a barrier and imposes on protestors a union by jokes or licences.
However, administration rarely simplifys their life.
For a union, comparison of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that is, for concrete reasons.
One of the principals is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other mutulous manifestations were held near several other fast recovery channels.
The moment of protest was the mid-day gathering near McDonald's from Times Square with the intervention of several local democracies, including that of Jumanee Williams, a member of the municipal council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of pieces and then don't even give you a sick leave and don't pay you the job you have done honestly!"
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkese Democrats in view, especially by the candidate at Major Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support the employees of the fast restoration so that they can earn a fair salary and the economic well-being that each New Yorkis deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important thing that the fast restoration sector has known throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated there without realizing that all were not fast-food employees, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's hard for the moment to say whether this mass movement stretch will make small ones.
"For the moment, we're only gonna get a little bit of a break in the brain."
Finally, the fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing the increased reality through special moons.
In the beginning, Google released its current model at its annual conference, and in November we learned that Microsoft had made the patent request.
However, it comes from the interview with the director of the 3D interactive technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, which for the scientists of this company, the moons are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on interaction between man and machine and try to extend the boundaries of this interaction at the same time.
Humanity in all of it remains for the moment in pixels on the flat screen and sometimes on the touch screen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and become radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect captors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the management.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has performed physical interaction, many things occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The acquisition of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance for the moment is not really.
We're trying to change this and we're working on really 3D image systems working on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out in our, in the physical world, to make it more tactical.
However, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical way.
And to start with, let's get rid of these stupid boxes of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she surprised?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality is raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his snow.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we are pensioned for gestures, not broad gestures, but rather for discreet, restricted handles.
The handles were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held arm that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a view.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- Is that what you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen?
You'll do it with word and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or does not do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of captors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
It can be done, for example, laser captors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect Captains, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, it is based on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
With regard to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, which adds to the work of algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep the resolution in mind according to X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and 30c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the captors a regular treatment delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current captors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone doesn't understand how that affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect has three "Cameras" today, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other one, a receiver of the reflective signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal capture of the field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or use it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar flexible product in Kinect, to play with the camera curve, and to see how this could help to define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his lunches to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, the moons are one of the most optimistic platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone with raised hands is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitor" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass moons to the smartphone.
The moons are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are those you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from the moons will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's just imagine that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple killer.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point to the right: there is no tactical sense!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perpetuation in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be a very good addition of tactical feelings.
For the moment, one of the most interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to use image support.
She's perfectly recording the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to assign palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interaction of several ultrasounds directed to a specific point where the right is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the fingers.
There have also been bottlenecks that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, and they are also a work area with perspectives.
- And did you try to break the brain?
Does he think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There's still a job down there that it'll have to do worse for a long time: the way to believe someone who is physically located in a very small space that he walks into an almost endless open space - we work on the concept of running tapes (only with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant problems.
At the moment, it is only a few years of work that the brain is still able to swallow.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fecundation.
The rule of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgese Front Guard" dedicated to the citizens who are in progress, to the culture and art front guard.
This ultra-selective list has already been hosted by prominent actors from the artistic scene of Saint-Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraterrestrial painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the summer Garden or still in white holidays and celebrations.
Kirill Miller's tables always gather the crowds, whatever their exhibition site.
It is one of the most socially and philosophic peters, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersbourgian front guard in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance smiles at the inhabitants and puts them in good humor.
He recently took a pride in Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg because he had enough courage for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you crossing the city all red and not yellow or turquoise?
- I've chosen the red as specialist in the aspect and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painting, image maker and society.
Even in society, all that is not gray is due to aggression and a negative attack.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
All the history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was done.
I realized it was my way.
Thus, the wax of old non-formal paints was past and the new, free, in my kind, was incomprehensible.
I started to associate with the painters of the new cow, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more cow.
I'm interested in the theatre, the fashion, the music, all other than the words.
It was important for me to find me at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which opened before work a music and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersburg Boheme.
Many are born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "The Van Gogh's Oril".
Chnour and his friends sang easy-to-play songs in moulant e-mails, including Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the group began to grow alive, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not have bad emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career started, but his basic education and training began, and he received them from us.
Gallery "D137", Griboïedov Club: these are the effects of the Art Clinic.
Our employees are involved as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I was called the Year's Stone, and that's when my kingdom came to an end.
It is not possible to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizeable style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong current and acuteity.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a contemporary category.
Before I was a social man, today it's bad and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes off, the tragedy falls.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory degiment.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but he needs to jump into the trunk instead.
And the lie will be wiped out by the spell.
- We've recently seen you in the role of Barbara's pride player.
Who else can play it?
- But maybe the commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today's commercial art has to be taken care of, delicate, lucurious.
A disintegration of culture is about to occur.
First, the people were divided into groups, the people of the forest loved one thing, the others.
Today, everything is divided into micro-Communitys, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred bucks ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each saw 100 fans.
- But thousands of people are coming to see St. Mikhailov!
- They're people who've been hurt to see it, that's the sexual and social side that goes away.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and the account will be less management, money, and everything will be lost.
I guess the main thing is don't fool them, don't hurt their lives.
When I was young, I drew up tables that a collector had grown up on the side of Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumerism has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the rule of good branches, it wasn't like that, the branches did not understand culture well, but they understood that good experts needed to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in Saint-Petersburg who could be experts, but they are separated, because there is a need for higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and fail them on a path.
At present, it's the "goose rule" that flows.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are paintings that need to be found in other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, the art is bad to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
With us, this bed is very close.
We have to make art fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project supported by the St. Petersburg Forum
Hide in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collimation with a deadly asteroid.
Spacecraft caravans with land on board go to search for a relief planet.
In order to save mankind, a big question arises: how to continue living our species in distress or still on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are two real planets that we can conquer, it would be only hypotheses.
"It's Venus and Mars," is thought to be Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the state's astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICH).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The question of reproduction in space began to be raised by focusing on the flower.
One and a half centuries ago, experiences on plants were carried out.
Four generations of smallpox grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land variety.
Then we put on the orbit of insects, small droplets of playwrights.
In 1979, stone eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed.
There's a normal pulse at the exit.
Then problems begin.
" The problem is related to the fact that the pulse must find support, it must be placed on its feet and start to move," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
In the absence of any support, the pulses were inseparable.
And within 10 hours, the new babies saw their instincts completely intruding.
The pulses did not respond either to the light or to the sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die within four days.
"We took their eyes out twice, then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, pointing out the lack of experience with the pulses in the space.
The last "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fettos in space.
In principle, we have found nothing supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it was the only experience. This kind of research needs to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, directly in space reproduction is not yet possible.
It's not a little business.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instincts.
Unlike babies, man is able, in principle.
The wise man has the abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional foundation.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has more valuable.
Our movement was surrounded and no one on Earth could say if it was going to take a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
" No one answered that question ", explained Vakhtang Vachtnadze, retired from the Fusion and Space Sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova was born to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have nothing and who give birth to a healthy generation after long flight.
"And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Soviet Union heroes and Russian hero Valery Poliakov.
However, mankind must look for new solutions in biotechnology, the protection of radiation and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonauts Training Centre: mandatory flight preparation phase.
Here, in no fleet, cosmonauts enter the extra-vehicle exits.
Water imitates the impostor.
If for adults, water is comfortable, but a foreign environment, for food, is their real element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby develops about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother’s belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
It is logical in principle, because from its birth to its first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the birth instructor for nutrition, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who comes from birth, the abuser is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
However, the muscles of the belly, of the bassin are very rapidly absorbed, and the baby's pulse capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by supporting us on the cover simulators.
We can certainly prepare a bed in a special room, and the woman will be able to make it out.
"And then?" asked Valerie Poliakov to consider this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the earth is not attracted, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't wear a food as an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we will consider in this case when we imagine the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a child with a completely disabled child," the Director of the Committee on Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in the space is still a matter of theory.
However, with that time it will become reality when the Terrens return to their vessels to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (High Institute for Public Finance Control) said: " The control of independent pseudo-work (in Czech " Švarc system " ) has failed due to politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is in the process of training for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Institute for the Control of Public Finance in an interview for Aktualnö.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, is what goes wrong with us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
Mr. First Minister recently stated that ODS should not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be properly applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government may not prevent an authority charged with going to inspect the compliance with the law," Kala observes.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee to the Chamber of Members, you referred to a Czech-German draft which compared the laws on public markets in these two countries.
What was he really asking about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and specific national legislation as well as for the practice itself.
We have gathered all of this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared: in general speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to continue to develop more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project really help you, and what can it do for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to our efforts to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, if this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude all wealth and any criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It could be that this system is at such a point as to be submerged by the papercase, that those looking for the gaps will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with regard to the implementation of public markets legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
For institutions, as well as the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is similarly organised, also has a slightly different board, but these two institutions are essentially similar.
The competences are also somewhat similar, however, with a cloud in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has accounts of this type at the level of different countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the State's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are then controlled at the level of the country's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but we cannot say that it is doing better in all areas.
Is it possible that they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider to be a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, which has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, is its effect already felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet affected our control operations.
As we do post-record checks, we have to count with a certain delay.
Our comments concern only the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "recognition of the risks of bad management" with which we have been exposed to the crisis of nearly 14,000 public markets - where these changes will be heard very well, as the thresholds have been amended as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you, then, regard the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an increase in the burden of administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more serious and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was obliged to accept that any violation of the law on markets would mean a lack of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful, then, to make the law tougher in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who wish to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will benefit from pressure on administration.
So what's the solution to get out?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS should not import entrepreneurs with self-sustainment controls of the Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be properly applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government may not prevent an authority charged to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He may declare, "We will change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was there.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be implemented, and this is just to protect the call for tenders.
However, it is also tragic that a sponsor is removed only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and it is, in my opinion, what goes wrong with us.
The roads are by ice, but most remain practical.
In some areas of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also frozen.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, the roads were practical this morning, but by ice and also frozen.
Temperatures fell and oscillating between -5° and -10°C but should be slightly remounted in the day.
The snowfalls have ceased in the region, and it remains in the mountains only a fine snowfall.
The crystals of the Metallifer Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered about 30 cm of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service are available on the basis of road patrols, visibility has been reduced.
The R6 road and the national roads in the region are now easy to practice.
However, caution remains to be put in place, for example on certain points where the coating can be frozen and glazing.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It is still on some of their trolls of ice cream remnants and in places where traffic is taxed.
Especially in high-level areas, drivers need to strengthen their guard.
regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Roads Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohem Roads are threatened by the training of rails and that snow layers charged by traffic can be found on the roads in mountain areas and located high.
Road maintenance services protect drivers against the risks of the training of brakes in the areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be glass in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitvy or Vysoké Mýto, and this is mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Switzerland were chemically treated.
The snow is found mainly in the Mountains of the Giants (Krkonoše) and the Mountains of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a snow layer is located on the roads in the high-level areas.
In Boheme of the East, the time will be dry today, the most frequent, with possible cloudy passes.
It will breathe a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3° and + 1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although, in some places, there is a need to demonstrate increased caution and adapt its behaviour to weather conditions.
This morning, the temperatures are between -3° and -9°C.
After the last drop of snow and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross broilerd areas, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is the source of information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 highway is practically feasible, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased surveillance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the national roads are dry and frozen.
Some truncheons can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Takhov.
The departmental roads and the third category are soft and, in this case, the maintenance of the iced trolleys is applied.
Drivers must be cautious, especially on the most frequent routes in the Shumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers in the Olomouc region, which is located in height, have to count today with a wide and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remains on the hill called "Červenohorské sitlo" and on the road leading to Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfalls forced the road maintenance personnel to land this night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the refugees are in practice without difficulty.
"On the heights of the Šumperk district are snowy remains.
The driving drivers headed by Jeseník must be expected to meet at the "Cervenohorské sisillo" Col, a thick and soft snowy layer, told ČTK today the head of maintenance services in the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in Jeseník district have also gone to place during the night; according to these latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now broken and burned, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are practical without difficulty, however, in the Šternberk district drivers should pay attention to the drills in forest areas to the remains of the wet grasslands.
Regions of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec
Since this morning, the North Boheme Road maintenance services have reported a number of difficult trials.
It is reported that in addition to some areas covered by snow or snow, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínce in Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at a lower altitude, so the snow and the snow should stay on the roads. In the mountains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulty has been reported for the moment.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of verglas, including around Štétí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow during the day, cloudy sky and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec from the main areas of movement.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have been corroded under the weight of the snow until the fall.
Shimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
That's not just one of these new alarmers, the kind of pieces we like to fall in.
In our group The Tap Tap, we're on a regular basis rather than saying that we're the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy to resist or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will set up a whole single project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more detail to our readers?
It's a charity action that we've been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11 a.m. in the morning.
On 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically at the time when the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, will be completed on an hour forward of 12 hours in relation to us.
Who did I have this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we had everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave with our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and keys from the world's end, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymme against the end of the world called " End of the Anounced World " (in Czech " Konec sveta zrušeno " ).
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we also listen to these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, if we succeed and that the end of the world is not ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also meet at a given time as part of a direct broadcast, in fact, uniquely from Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X and also sing...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other Czech characters, because we organize many charity concerts and events...
We strive to make them actively involved in these projects.
It has been observed that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that this makes them fun.
What will benefit from these concerts against the end of the world?
Equipped with the Student Training Centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we work for the implementation of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, and for six years.
Teachers regularly make themselves available to students at the Jedličkóv Institute and offer them activities that are interesting and fun to them.
Students themselves do not have the means to attend courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the building of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Many groups of music and interpreters will show up at each of these concerts?
What criteria do you have?
We have tried to develop a programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, you will mount on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustrato Sphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also prepared for other " mega events " of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; we will also certainly prepare a quality program with interesting invitations.
We would also like to play the next year in the Czech Republic's home in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to do well to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of persons with disabilities.
How will you manage the organisation and logistics of your tournaments?
It's not as terrible as it's going to look first.
We have five members in electric failure, where the equipment must travel in support, of course we also trim a lot of baggage and tool boxes....
So far it has been more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
With your travel abroad, you can compare how different these countries are for what is access facilities for persons with reduced mobility, from the attitude of public opinion towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just been witnessed in Moscow that in the east we are all only in an initial phase.
With regard to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; it is not yet running that a person is moving into an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it an evidence of giving priority to a person who is in error in an elevator.
Fortunately, there is also an association that seeks to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
What else must we do to reach the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things for which we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite clear that people with severe disabilities move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, the museum, anywhere...
This is not even very common there because a large number of persons with disabilities are actively involved in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposite the point of progress!
Respect for public and access facilities is a thing, but the situation will really change when we have sports, artists, actors, politicians or prominent lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, back a few years, what has moved you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as a teacher at the Jedlička Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am a musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, in time, as our Moderator Ládía Angelovic said, we lost some control of the situation (rires).
Has success happened only in recent years, if I don't lie?
It is true that creating links with known singers and working actively in the promotion of the group has helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it's like it wasn't in the mind.
With the European Union's grants, we can also have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you intend to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of tricks that match each other.
In a certain way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I can say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally loved, it's natural ...
But mercy is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a whole life and grow up, provided they have the necessary means for sure.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it's not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigient in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's actually all normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they should come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this works in the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
And alone, Lady Angelovic.
We're an open group, people go and go, there's nothing we can do.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the event of the expected day of the end of the world, Thursday, 20 December 2012, from 21:00 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in Incheba, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual reenactments when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Year " will be played together.
The aim of the concert is to collect financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Multifunctional Training Centre Studio located in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the bill prevention is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was approved as the twentieth member of the Agency, and it was the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and has been participating in a number of agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's road to space began much earlier.
Already before the second world war, the Polish people had been working on space flights; they had not always met understanding.
For example, I would like to refer to the Conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which it presents ideas drawn from its pre-garden work entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold audiences, and years later Šternfeld will remember that only Dr. Jan Gadomski is interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his work " Introduction to the Astronautics " in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a major promoter of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many works devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of the world's reputation astronautics, and his contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Since 1925, a train was built in Poland to be equipped with a piston engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of the project are known.
It is no longer clear whether the rifle should be used to propel or brake the rail.
The only information known about this train is that of the press of the day.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to be devoted to the fusions.
Research was conducted by Komörka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It is a source of preserved documents that this research has reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of German weapons, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photo-electronic chassis merger, designed by engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobombamba lotnicza" by a author named Lelywy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were for the purpose of military use of ignition engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of fusion technology were conducted by the interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczaswow Committee Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war ended in its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Journal of the Problem, which contains four more detailed articles on aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and from the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He retained his role until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological fusus (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which is the first Polish fuse to perform scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-meter-long hole had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An improved version was subsequently built, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, two RM-2 stages of the fussation were tested in the wilderness of Bledov.
It had a length of 1,4 metres and probably weighed 11,5 kg.
The following prototype should be able to perform specific scientific work - RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963 all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 Fuse was established during the period 1962 - 1965, successful in the first RM type mergers.
This hole, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fusée had an area offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum port of all these types of engine was 37 km.
In the 1965–68 period, the Meteor-2 mergers took place in the Aeronautic Institute, and the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 unit had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful 10 kg load at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on the Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the program.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Service Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
There is no doubt that it is interesting to consider this problem from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in particular that the various economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital allocated to a frozen financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (salaries) result in price tension.
It is appropriate to place the following meaning: a producer seeks to import low-sale goods in order to resist economic competition by " making the price more expensive " of the competitor, with a view to taking a larger part of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
To a large extent, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is an important unemployment in countries where labour prices are higher than other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence even responsibility for unemployment, the social burden of the State is increasing necessarily.
All this situation intensifys the perfect evil will of employers to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this course of profit.
This situation is such a public awareness that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Non-suspend practices of private capital in different economies create a situation in which governments of different countries are obliged to launch themselves in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the expense of private capital without taking into account the social background.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to make it economically difficult for its own people to accept the dictates of private capital prices, particularly in the area of salaries.
This is part of a system of economic constraints in the long-term unemployment and part by the restriction of employees' rights in the area of labour legislation.
This results in an increasing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes clear that employees receive wages such as the State considers it necessary to pay for them to reach the minimum level of living.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures in practice of all Member States of the south of the EU are undoubtedly a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to migrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with poor wages, outside society, in the hope that one day private capital will be invested in their countries.
The question must be asked here: Where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may no longer come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital expressly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory intervention.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by itself, the whole state.
The answer to that question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, by granting mutual benefits, in legislation where everything is punishable but not punished.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial means, the national departments are in favour of developing draft laws to lawyers' cabinets closely related to industry.
These draft laws were then adopted in Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as the Western-type constitutions declare it, but powerful financial groups serve their own interests.
It is clear that the democracies leading to liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompée": "The State has been in full deliberation for a long time and the functions have been attributed to violence.
The cuts of glass, the benefits obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The down-table and corruption would spread without limits, and the people would make elections with already sold votes" ... ... "The honest people were not looking for any functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consoles."... 'It really started to say that the return to this difficult situation was an autocratic and that it was necessary to choose a strong man'... It is true that Appianos had the Pompua spirit, but it is Caesar who has constantly transformed democracy into an absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without prejudice to the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and value the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as a matter of course, there is no previous decline in elites, no effort is made to undertake deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalization without the outbreaks of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be considered a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as crimes against humanity as we know from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and improve the position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Rein will never come out of violence and will never be able to" say Sting in the song titled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "forgets how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, he wouldn't have it," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the part of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others supporting the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and consider Israel a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its vogues of repeated killings; I believe that the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a point of view that is “the rear of the stream” on the one that is mainly used by the tension that has been lost for more than 95 years (in view of the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small town in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available in the study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more specifically from the individual group, which is the main intensifier of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they had to act on the throne to someone who was leading their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration will generate certain powers cannot be achieved in one generation.
The Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the forest (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
It's written about them.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Since the 1990s, they have acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they have been subjected and which have always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or engage in wars against countries where they have not yet had such participation (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after only 4 conversions of Khadhafi. Meanwhile, Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to fight this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Central Bank to the Bank of America of Rothschild and set out during the civil war his own money (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to dissipate the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and Mr Louis McFadden was fined in 1936 while he wanted to attempt a trial against the FED to slow down the large economic crisis in 1929.
Their dream of power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a franc-machson who began at the 33th grade, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eradicating Europe's major state monarchies, the second was to eliminate colonialism, including Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population from 1 to 0.5 billion (a large amount of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution), and finally to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following the chaos).
These solutions are false and are always leading to a deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid any recurrence of crises such as the ones they caused in 1907).
After the first world war broke out by the murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with German capitalisation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Syria) and was followed by the massacre of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
In order to make the second world war easier, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed in Germany far-fetched war-reparations such as the conditions of a radicalization of the apauvrian masses (which they then have enough energy to place a sufficiently powerful leader, showing the strength of the partners, offering simple solutions), and, on the other hand, they have created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which they effectively have) of a fifth pillar of fire and launch a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which inspired the creation of a Jewish State, preferring the region of historical Judah with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above lays the basis for a massive Jewish migration to Palestine and the first outbreaks with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
It is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international banks initially held it; or whether everything he did was planned, however, the fact that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war repairs imposed on Germany were at the beginning of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel opened a fireplace that could cause a third world war.
If international banks are able to trigger this war, the Jewish people will be like her during the second world war, the first victim of wars, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an enormous laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it's enough to see how people are actively divided between Israeli partners and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a torture inflicts another torture on an endless cycle of violence, and where, at the root of all, is the ability of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
There is a difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international banks offer people only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist, loyal to international banking, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the organization of cooperation in Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls Ormuz's destruction by which 20% of all global oil (this corridor has no width of 2 miles) and the destruction of the world economy.
Under which light now emerges the proposals of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a set of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new child is born with an electronic puzzle that makes him totally controlled.
" That they force all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on hand or face a brand in red, so that they can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this wild beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that the one who has a good counts the numbers of this lovely beast.
This number represents the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a group of protesters composed of Islamic students arrested Tehran's American embassy and detained 52 diplomats.
They should be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not lead to the positive administration of the US, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would seriously undermine the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had started on the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard time for the United States loan, and it was even worse later than the failure to release hostages by force.
The secreted diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organised by the Algerian Government.
Their success in the United States has led to a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian feeling.
The Iranian debashion strongly contributes to Jimmy Carter's failure to face Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, from the actor and stager Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she's busy, six employees get out of the embassy.
After complicated periods, they were found in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA has been able to get them out of Iran through a rocambolesque coverage: they have left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team who have come for the tour of a large science-fiction film.
Combination of species
The expert's exfiltration plan, Tony Mendez, requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, the specialized stores became the film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company was created from real offices.
The details of the operation remain secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an insolent combination of several kinds.
It is part of a political earthquake designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a success, of a tragedy - such as in the Ocean trilogy's eleven, twenty and threeteens.
The ambiguities occur: the sequences of Teheran of documentary style (in the sub-titles are presented in iconic photographs of the event time and the way in which, through these photos, the same situations have been re-transscribed in the film, there is no great difference),
the lightest passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA's general district and other institutions with men who are accustomed to discussing the situation around conference tables, in the halls and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
As a Ridiculated Actor, he became a respected stage player and his actor's game stopped causing ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-term after the police shock " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2001).
It's also the first film of Affleck that doesn't take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the features that enjoy its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is taken" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, when real facts are rebuilt; the initial sequence of the collapse of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests confusion and improbability that arise when Sudan, in a given place, writes a history page.
Affleck and his colleagues have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake tour team in Tehran's base).
Too many places
The stager had to be satisfied with a subject offering only a few palpitating scenes, in a cinematographic sense of the term.
He did well, he sometimes added some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is separated by a cut of phone in America and the follow-up on the landing track is sufficiently drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its different nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are all charming in their role as Hollywood co-operatives, their staff would have deserved a bigger place and that is not far from there alone.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is shown with a moderate interest, appreciation of the realization and style back to the 1970s.
It's driving the viewer, but it's hard.
As a reminder of another story, in a way that is not yet over, and as an example of the exhilarating character of the representation of secret services as all-powerful and all-informed, it does.
Rules for filling balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry on the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a 40 per cent quota of women for the management of large European companies has been at the beginning of our decision," said Pravo, the organizer of this survey, Patrick Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women has already been made.
Until now, however, women have benefited from living insurance rates because they are, of course, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can signal by the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU's workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
One of the EU's conflicting regulations, for example, is the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or to prohibit the use of mercury-trust thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of dangerous substance or even the directive on the size of chicken boxes, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of using the term "carnage" or withdrawal from sale of classical ampoules.
The quality bananas must have a size of 14 cm.
European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (which is why the Czech Republic currently imposes the claims of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups, for example, are the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be of a size less than 14 cm or of an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it would only harmonise non-human national standards that were difficult to trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have been adopted despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food shortages.
The first price will be available in this investigation to the EU Regulation of the last year, which should include a warning that children under 8 years of age should not be exposed without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey where balloons are, among other things, the first cause of the death of children by abortion.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age for what is to suffer in firestorms.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rules on European officials themselves are quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedone" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Letez Faire" association of liberal economists, the Bankonnipoplatky.com server has appointed in this investigation, in addition to the above-mentioned doubts, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has set maximum volumes for food reserves available on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the volumes set for the conservation and risk campaigns, which is therefore a major increase.
The organizers of the survey considered the idea of paying money to certain countries because they did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to request grants.
However, these ideas are not original from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have seabeds makes us sick.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."In the autumn of 2004, the Minister for Agriculture of the day Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our production of wheat, and after the purchases of the so-called "interventionists", the State had found itself with stocks full of which it had then to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of blues from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the communities by the Ministry of Local Development, directed by Minister Pavel Njemec (US-DEU), who were to serve in particular to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "External regulations are rare".
If the regulations often cause criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, EU efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's operation and in the field of overall development, are more likely to be jeopardised.
For example, experts say that the problem of using EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic must, like other countries of the Union, fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always succeed) is a source of strong emotions in the Czech countries.
If, at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoukké vorájżky" for what the name "Tuzemský rom" goes back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar, not beet sugar, may bear the name of rhum.
In the official list of EU-registered products, it is now available in a company of world-known perfumes such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck or Parme, biscuits de Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Carpes de Pohorèlice et de Třebönn ("Pohorélicý a Třebóńský capr") and the Houblon de Žatec ("Zatecký chmel").
Pardubice's epice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the gâteaus called "Cornets de Horíce" ("hořikké turbičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm not just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
Mr. Senator, how is the idea of presenting themselves to the presidential elections?
This isn't just a senator or president who cares about me.
If everything worked out without problems in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate.
But I no longer bear in mind how the country has been pillaged since the last twenty years, that volleyballs are not under taxes and taxes and the age of early retirement increases.
I had no intention of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don't ask for, then I'm trying to get a solution to change it.
And since I am over forty years old and I am a member of no party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you are quickly on the road for the Court (N.D.T.: Chair).
Will you not then turn your back on those whom you chose?
I always said I'd run into the battle for the Château according to the results of the senatorial elections.
I then made it clear that if I were a senator, I would be presented to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it's just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the largest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we are proud of those who try to change.
This adds to the pressure that undermines the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
We have, for example, stated to me that I am proud of the journalists or that I was the counsellor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Court as a war horse for the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements over twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you have to change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have been pressured to make tourism leadership activities a free profession, and I have gained cause.
The problem is politics: when one comes to the left or right with a good project, it is clearly rejected and it is delayed by the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have much more opportunities to support all parliamentarian parties.
I have the advantage of being able to take on every part what is best for our country and put it into practice.
Do you rather think of yourself as a right or left man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people like me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go ahead.
What matters to me is not that people are either left or right but to gather people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS, and I am doing the same indiscriminately against bad ideas.
Do you get pregnant when someone tells you you're a populist?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain ideal goal and vision.
You're trying to get close to him.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I have spoken have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without Parliament's support, you're only left with slogans.
You won't live long in politics with it.
Do you think that if you go to see and talk to people, you will, for example, succeed in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose them.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to transmit directly to the TV to the presidents of parliamentarian parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
So they should possibly explain why they don't want to.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to pressure the political scene.
Take, for example, the president's election to direct harassment, which was obtained through the pressure of the public opinion.
I tend to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find alliances for my views and visions.
I've just started politics and I've been trying to get the majority support for my programme.
I'm just trying to make things better, and if that doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and return to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves to the senatorial elections as well.
I met Radim Jancura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the mazout.
I'm presented because people are really unhappy, but now I'm sad.
Six hundred people did not vote and what they did, most of them, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent people.
People have chosen a Senate that will be difficult to make changes.
Nevertheless, I would fight for my vision, for example, for the direct suffering of mayors and prefects in regions.
Do you think you're going to find your own part?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is free of charge and then I don't have any financial means.
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I love about 60 million of my personal assets.
In Prague I have a field of a value of 25 million, an apartment of a value ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of an art value of about ten million, an Aston Martin that is worth 3.5 million and an Skoda Superb of a value of 1 million and a few millions on my account.
In any case, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a gamma dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was flirting with women and fighting against evil and abuse.
You're running in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth of property and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I end up?
I've already invested 2 million and half a million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay for this campaign of my own.
My campaign fees are comprehensively covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live in it, for example, paying the English school of my son who costs 30 miles a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I would not be able to make any choice.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the chest?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the lead in the travel agency early.
People wanted me to be a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
However, I need to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the weekly edition of the newspaper Prava.
The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To convince them, it is sufficient to consult Spijkenisse and the newly raised book mountain - 2 photos
"I find that this building is moving, it is very futuristic, so something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large nearby company, tells us, "Yes, he's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone's online, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going from his full grace to one of those hanging libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a town-Dortoir that has nothing to do with the gates of Rotterdam, has a very special record.
The community of 80,000 lives shows the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
To return some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and to reproduce the seven fissures on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small paint-armed concrete applets.
The success of cultural offensive remains limited.
So the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam's MVRDV architects' office, mastered diagrams in audacity and creative concrete and often cynic buildings, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented to the competition in 2003 with five books under arm and a rehearsal on face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, converging and excavating the shoulders, Maas, the front, impounds his choice books by order of size to make them a pyramid, and ends his speech with a "common love!"
Here, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain is on the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and some house buildings and Mitoyan homes for a total of 50 rooms.
In early November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is also the case with this little tin roof, which has so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pétone zone and a wall of an austerity painting, whose white faces invite them to think that they are opening a leatherry, is enriched by a contemporary architecture work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in her history.
The long way to read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under breakfast clock.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you dig the floor of the building at the discovery of its topography.
The interior made of glass is bright and clear, the sun in Dutch brekes and the elegant reverberators speak the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and small boys and girls who play ball.
And all over books, books, and more books.
"Normally, library radiuss are located along the faceade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and unhindered," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely confused the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain has been properly adjusted: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building are located in the center.
A special beauty lies in the black areas of the library, which are so many lamps, so many balustras, and so forth.
A new experience for vision, touch and love.
Even architects and engineers in the building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at Spijkenisse municipality, in a response to Standard.
That's how one day we found in a agricultural company freezing an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimeter of thickness has been used for years as a substrate in the holes and fields.
It's a good market and we get time.
The end of the membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in place of a diameter of four cm.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogenous and resistant matter, including the smell of both a new car and sports shoes.
On top of 105 steps is the summit of the mountain.
Nearly 500 meters away, the literary coffee offers us an amazing view of the city, but also Dutch croquets and pots.
These latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the mountain of literature.
Gifts for the New Life
"It is incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model environmental project," Trouborst trusts.
The building's temperature is regulated by geothermals.
Whatever the mountain of books is below an hour of wine, the sun shines only a little while inside, even the days of good time.
The wood-mounted wood-peckers in relation to the glass face serve as solar steam, intercepting a large part of the radius.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are expensive from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic information, is already at risk of entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Chinese traditional medicine, describes even Boekenberg as "the final soul found" in Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, in the opening, each citizen was invited to give a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed the lives of the library that was not yet completely Garnie (now it accounts for 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The radios are all over the place.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
Even if that's not just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even if she may appear young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer status to the United Nations.
But then she chose the arrest.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not admit what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Berlin, however, needs to exercise caution because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it no longer supports the American position.
Germany wanted to reaffirm its independence, but it was too critical to Israel.
In the March 2011 resurrection in Libya, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany experience difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to avoid a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to introduce a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union is a complex situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still trying to find this role, but they're on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
An external policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What, then, is the term "normal" foreign policy for Germany?
It expresses the desire to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy and therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the absence of a United Nations vote?
Germany was first developed in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a decisive element.
However, I would not be too important, because this is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But there is a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany sleep in its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand German position.
That is why I think that the fraction is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany has shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
In contrast, the United States has announced its vote in clear terms.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American internal policy scene.
I believe that Obama's administration is secretly demonstrating a great understanding of the European position.
However, given the country's political configuration, the Government cannot fully understand its public position.
I think that the real differences of opinions are not so big that they always seem.
If you observe the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will note that Obama is far from becoming enthusiastic about Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in reconcileing its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, this would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter into a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are doing at present in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future assume a locomotive role and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been delicate.
But I think the Germans are well aware of the fact that they have to play a role that makes them more independent.
Is Germany able to play a role as an actor on the international scene, and does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on the role of first-class?
Germany is not always used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for some obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings become understood.
This is not easy for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be forced by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed of very different neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only decreases, but is the EU currently unable to achieve this gap, so who remains?
The Germans will just have to play a more important role.
And even if it doesn't please them, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Protect Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani become Chinese soda
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what's he really doing?
Behind this name is a mark officially deposited in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand enjoys such a protection as the company that bears the name cannot complain.
And even if she could, she wouldn't be sure she'd get a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from Taylor Wessing, specialized in violation of the property law in the Middle East.
Every week, a new file arrives at my office.
Imitators need only a few additional letters to be able to record their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is registered, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies also copy themselves in all legality, such as Puma, the sports producer.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which records are made by the Pékin brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company deposited the Zegna DF Puma brand, a designation that the firm has artificially created by fitting part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres at several stages that sell only contrabands.
However, Pattloch's case is different: his mandate is to attack the fact that the Chinese trade mark office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpia", of parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say there is nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, you have to fight this trend," asks Pattloch.
"The mark is frozen, the singularity disappears, the damages to reputation are enormous."
Financial losses and costs of justice are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, especially in terms of cost-effective products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to delete the suspicious records of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These last can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch was a trial in which the court rejected the complaint because after a long period, the criticised name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be obliged to give money to the plaintiff, because he would have rented his brand in China.
In this area, it's sometimes the law of the young man who rules.
There are also notable cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of Sany singing machine, the same company that was about to acquire the production of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why the Chinese can use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, the buyer of Volvo, used a blue and white logo that reminded him of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had been lost against Hong Kong and Singapore's plaintiffs who had reoriented the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they can't do anything.
The Pekin CTMO brand office admits, however, that there was some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would last the year of "a situation of urgency in the performance of the work to a normality found".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have dropped by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing an increase of 75 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Deal a new card
As in China, figures are often impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the head of the classification for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be worth the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A legal battle costs a lot more, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has fought against a Chinese plaintiff.
Indeed, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illicit manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"It is our fault because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Mark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Municipalities.
Freudenberg has received some cause gain from the following two courts, but the opposite party continues to fight until today.
Watching is being put in place
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and wins the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, trialsome and costs us much time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the past hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed to the party a "great sum in euro to six figures" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what it represents for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Middle East even threaten to spread to Europe.
This would be the case if the operators of the region were to ensure the operation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company in Germany.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it had been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "The guard is to be put."
Pattloch and the German companies advise him to show great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to be proud of the international law of trademarks, foreigners should rather "register in China as well as all that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler said.
Otherwise, costs may be much more important than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opposite party for the use of its own name, such as the Wentzler explanation.
Or we will lose our position on the segment of the market in question.
World Day to Fight AIDS: Towels, Singer, Help
The Imongani Choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland AIDS Orphelins rejoice in their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that is more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we knock on the foot: cowboy boots, basketball bags, ladies' shoes and men's mocassins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very fast, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - high, low, tenor and soprano -, they behave, shout and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra head almost loses his toilet shoes when he runs the orchestra with his hands with a wild flexible.
We're on Monday evening, the Imongani choir repeats a new song in the music room of Heidelberg's Medical Psychology Institute.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come from the geneticist in human medicine to man at the funeral.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy puzzle, each Korean has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNUSADA, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans from Esitjeni village AIDS have found oranges in Germany through the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them frequent secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros at least, we can become parrain.
This amount is guaranteed to the school's child money, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo centre.
Impopi means "historic Count" in Zulu or even "Wanner of Praises".
No one can speak fluent language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeats songs in this foreign language that it has grown in Germany for now to make it into its native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German Choral.
40% of people attending
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in junta or land houses and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphanages, because HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe at least the maladies that are acceptable in Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population has never practically accepted male circumcision, a measure which, however, ensures a proven reduction in the risk of infection.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of thirty.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the Chorale had been able to discover the village. The Impongis had seen many children in the street where he had not only the parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is absolutely no perspective.
At first, it was only some people who personally committed themselves to spending a few euros each year in order to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal every day.
But later a year later, the Choral was founded on "Voices for Africa", an association that has been working since almost professionally on Esitjeni's AIDS orphanages.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs, syphilis, chlamydides and blennorragy (or gonorrhea).
Current ISTs are HIV, human papillome virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis and galley pumps belong to parasitic ISTs.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhea appear often in men who have sexual relations with other men.
Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contact between men is the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five reported in Germany.
In adult heterosexuals, chlamydiasis, trichomonase, candidosis (fungic), blennorragia and human papillome virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher incidence of chlamydiatic infections than in other groups of the population.
According to European findings, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the virus of the human papillome is running among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has doubled in 10 years: the figure has gone from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, I had about 2,700 cases.
This represents a reduction of a tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause abscess at the level of genetic organs, urinary pain, white loss, low vent pain, and the appearance of buttons and veins.
However, they do not regularly conduct any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Conservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases may also be transmitted by lubricant infection or close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who changes from sex partners regularly undergo examinations.
Most of the fast-depressed IST can be cured and late cycles can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsors, the gifts, but especially the funds that the Koreans collect through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"At the same time, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphanages are well located, for example, in one of their mothers.
The gogogos, so it's called the old women in Zulu, are the villagers' pills.
Some of them host up to 14 orphanages, offer them a drink and ensure that they return to school every day in their uniforms.
Orphelin, which no longer exists, is in a safe place, in Khanyyle, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a school of codification and has allowed the construction of two pools. With the American Health Organisation's competition, the association has organized a HIV testing test for many residents.
This is not about itself, because even if the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a matter of sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These measures imposed by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also disseminating the virus across the country.
There are, however, conservatives on each side of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, fighting against flesh."
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, the Koreans of Impongi travel together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence, and black identity that many people from the black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The full white bus singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such as not only a good smile and joy, but sometimes a tears to a few grueling guards.
The bus always drives them to Esitjeni, where the Koreans visit their daughters.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of Ezulu.
"Go to Estijeni, you will find light," the people there said.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres by bird flight from Heidelberg to these corridors that climb the foot in the Bergheimer Street repeat room, the light is also found.
Message: NASA discovers the presence of ice in Mercure
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercure.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters of space.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercure.
Although this planet is the nearest of the Sun, it recovers from frozen water, as three studies published on this Thursday in the special edition "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of a ice cover in the region of the planet in the shadow.
This cover would have a width of at least 30 cm that could go up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercure.
However, no one connects the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messener probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
Discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Even though the inhabitants of our planet, sounds, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstitials through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Mrs. Ceres.
As Pluton, who orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomy Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a "family port" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the most difficult red points to identify are the "new" in the universe's docking room.
The telescope Spitzer discovered this region where stars are born, baptized "W5", a very romantic name, in the Caspian constellation, at 6,500 light years.
NASA Telescope Spitzer photographed the glowing glass of a star in the process of dying.
The circle as beignet is composed of elements that the star is designed when it dies.
In the Nebulous Trinity, 5,400 light years of Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The telescope Spitzer photographed this galactic accommodation room.
Pleiades, also known as "the seven sisters", can be observed in the eye not during the night.
However, the telescope increases the colors in value.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebulous, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is at 700 light years in the constellation of the Verseau.
His comparisons to a terrestrial continent were worth the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular display.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope have been able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmities of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's Annexes.
One theory is that the amalgams are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the biggest and most clean photographs that the Hubble telescope has taken is that of the galaxy of Tourbillon.
According to the tendon, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Australian Observatory shows the nebulousness of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittaire, for thousands of light-years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divisioned, divided into three), because three trained dusters divide the heart that shines from the birthplace of the stars.
The astronomers photographed the premises of a cosmic character in the Serpentary constellation: at 400 million years of light-years of Earth, the nails of two fusion galaxies precipitate one another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you do not like technical abbreviations, you can use its name as "austral fire hole".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the nebulous of Iris in the constellation of Cephée.
The nebulous is 1,400 light years and consists of dust grains that are 10 percent smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was produced from optical and radiographic clichés taken by various telescopes.
There is the circle made up of black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebulous there is the group of young stars that is the brightest of our Milky Way.
The celestial sphere always gives birth to new stars.
These stars, which are connected by the Nebulous of Rosette, also create in constant young stars at 5,000 light-years of Earth.
In this galaxy to the light rays and covered by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed of much hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes has not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever deeper into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hall of the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, there is the Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows the universe to be observed through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror itself reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa was segmented to make savings.
The diameter reaches all the same about 11 meters.
The inconsistencies of the economic method of construction are that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
Its particularity focuses on its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arcíbo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person owned by a computer can help "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to the power of calculation of his machine.
View of the Austrian European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can clarify the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) is also planned for the OSCE site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clicks before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaii Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world's largest.
They worked two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory that monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it gives us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are inhabited.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The space telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to space as soon as 2018 on board an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have a mission to find the light produced by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercure also opens the ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data have shown the presence of ice in Mercure for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists are now convinced.
Drinking beer daily, and living up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people have reached the age of dignity of the patriarches of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

An investigation into a country where there is still a relatively young 97-year-old.
Travel in the Talysh mountains is a failed romanticism.
Along the many routes, the small bus covers the length of forested hills, torrential streams, and modest farms.
It's all green and fertile, we think almost in the Black Forest.
But we're here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we do not know much, is not that they speak perfectly of the Persian and the Assyrian and that they have a very longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town has its aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakuu, is very painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country has to retain its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is suspected that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou has become famous in May through the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
It is the direction of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of fate in the world.
There we can discover the life of about eight tenths of Talysh in the region that is over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having a child at 136 years of age
But the controversial character of the museum is Şirali Muslimov, a shepherd who was 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Muslim's age seems more than doubt.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," states Fatulayeva.
Man would marry three times and he would have 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have a daughter.
Would Shirali Muslimov be misled for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, also heard of the man at the age of Central Asia.
"Early older people also live in some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "there are also people who live incredibly old in Sardinia."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence on the basis of the absence of documents, without recognizing that there was no record of civil status.
Every day, a deep beer wine
Nevertheless, the people of the Lerik region often reach an age of respect for the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years of age.
So what is the reason for longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
In contrast, Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a food issue.
However, it does not seem desirable, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich meals in the calories of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and especially milk products and many who drink a deep wine daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Chengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical of seeing it throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor next to a bathroom, where she knocks the content indistinctly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and one daughter, who have been grown up for many years.
Two little children are also lying in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests serving in typical wines armed in the form of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under its follard are covered with long blond skirts that his son sees us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampooing," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly retirement is sufficient to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small pigs.
For the rest of my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments have been after World War II.
But everything improved when Hedar Aliyev took orders.
The language of the propaganda stands in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the culture of the nation's parental figure, a man who still ruled his country as a dictator, was hardly aware of borders in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manoeuvres (about the same amount in euro) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good living train in the region.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva, who has been crying for a long time, has been saying, "The elderly enjoy a great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" included in the Constitution
The revolution takes place in Cairo.
Rebel demonstrations reveal the country's deep fractal.
The draft constitution based on the charia is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian President is not to have words of emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he declared on state television.
His speech was for the whole people, but especially for the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay peoples.
Because all members of the opposition are confused and desperate.
They were afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi stated, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended the sentences "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, a doctorate at South California University, wants to save.
Will the judicial power be reversed?
The 234 articles in the heat produced by the most Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force round are indeed disturbing in some measure.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the case-law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and remains an issue of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the legal framework that results from applying a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it should be given to consider a newly introduced article which stipulates that, with regard to all subjects related to the Charia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radio spectrum throughout the Sunny Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative device, which would actually lead to the protection of the judiciary.
Many aspects of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the Moubarak regime, these courts were used to suppress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Obviously, it would just be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article is prohibited from offending or spreading the prophet Mohammed or his envoys.
In contrast, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
There is also doubt about the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "infect people".
Is it enough to draw up a president's cartoon or to tell a blog about the destruction of a man of law?
Many points are therefore the subject of interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and which, according to his own words, will "be too soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution came back."
The opposition has been mobilized for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on the Tahrir site in Cairo, promising to drop the caria before it enters into force.
"The revolution is renewed and we are going to win," launched Hamdin Sabbahi, third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be cast into the villages of history".
On Twitter, the instant messenger service, he accused Morsi's parties of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we'll go to his palace and we'll return it," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," said Egypt's media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its innocence.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conflict called for a protest not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
Vulnerable women and parishioners of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, were scandalous: "The people claim to apply the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, affirming that "the Qur'an [was] their Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic place of Tharr, where everything started, would have quickly brought about a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's partners wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers declared that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as their partners, were expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time for the people to decide by the forums of the country's leadership.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have extended until February and include all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the Moubarak courts.
He did not do it because he shared their concept of the world, but because human rights are indisputable to him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And now the term has not even been pronounced in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sontag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three forces discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are critical to the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President actually gave him all his powers," Saeda says.
However, democracy cannot operate without civil society organizations.
Saeda is slowed down, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the different political ideologys on the Nile side with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protester on the Tharrir place is kept in custody: "You're wearing a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
Norway’s Recife: Is it the most beautiful fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's success secret be linked to the capture of premises for an extremely beautiful fish?
Take advanced brakes.
Place them in the midst of a pile of woven footwear and salads.
Wait a week.
And you'll get the degrading smell of the rakfisk, one of Norway's most caught places.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, everywhere, fills the air.
The rakfisk consists of salted and fermented wheat in water for a period of time - according to the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When darkness is installed and cold, the Norwegians gather to attend a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat cru, then you take a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local pumper also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people come down with small fish mucks and grow up with a lot of drinks.
"Some people prefer it to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some butter.
If you can avoid doing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent hours in a bus.
The rakfisk goes back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the cooling, the fish was caught in water barrels in the air and then went off automatically.
Then, during the winter, once perfectly fermented, the fish is out and - no doubt with the meanings of alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly moving to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedishs, their old rivals whose country was not so rich for so long as Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something of importance, a vital element, although adoring, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is hot - a small beer paint or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international times, which is not to spread it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the extremist right-wing racist who beat 77 people, including women and children.
When they call this murder, they talk about "the incident of 22 July".
The Norwegians have the wrong idea that in their peaceful country, one of them could commit such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important things in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason to justify our success," explains our servant Anna, in the blue hair and in the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a hand-cracket.
We are - how you say - smart people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to notice.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - but with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry, it is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries spent money on windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its belts firmly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make the snowy in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she added in a loud laugh.
I'm stuck in the snow, and I'm making the cake to buy me what to eat - I've got my dose of rakfisk.
In the menu, a hamburger made of elan, a true discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places where we use rakfish for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most lovely of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter has a noud-Papillon, surrounded by rakfisk seats.
We believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Look at the points, Havard."
We hear laughs and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of alcohol.
Or maybe it's because of fish emancipation.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure.
While President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take over his duties in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, he is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
The road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where the furniture is legible in normal time, a security barrier has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
The next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential chair to become the new President at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is well supported by the results of President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the process of a drug war that has already cost around 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has committed itself to reducing violence against the Mexican people," said Mr. Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before the US President, Pena Nieto was the governor of the state of Mexico.
A very popular and tempting state of capital. On its pre-election land, opinions on this new leader are divided.
A direct man
For example, it is included in the memory of everyone in Valle del Bravo.
The premises are dedicated to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of the new paths of Mr. Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been made to these routes, sometimes bottled and full of cravases.
Wooden plates of its name are attached outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to put in place sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the convention and part of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we look forward to a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years of unremitting power, the PRI was awarded in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many actors in the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticisms of opposers who appeal to the new president to lack of charisma.
He's a full, very busy man with a wonderful vision of the country.
He's an excellent man of state and, above all, he can hear.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo could no longer be flashy.
Hidden under the highway, it is, in all respects, a bathroom in the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called upon to withdraw to fight drug gangs that live in the neighborhoods, and violence against women was particularly severe.
In a sinister area, dozens of women killed during the past two years were found on the ground of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sad place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's tractors said that he had failed to address the problem of perfect murder against women when he was in office.
Unfortunately, they accuse their administration of refusing to see the reality in front of them.
In a concrete house, typical of this abandoned neighborhood, Irinaa Buendia struggles to keep her tears when she shows me pictures of her lost daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version was a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I got to her, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," said Mrs. Bundia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body stiffness had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana picks up the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family saw refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old roommate, a troublemaker, a plaintiff.
They want us to accept what they say and to relax.
"But this is not normal because there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his Friday afternoon, she will be given a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to give priority to it during its mandate.
"I hope he will be as well as president as when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of City Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of any ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during the detention.
The trial involves Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case because Manning's sequencing has been made under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of exceeding thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove, on Friday, that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the worst source of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- had failed many times to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had not revealed any complaints about his treatment.
The counter-questioner -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request that Manning be classified as a result of the fact that the segregation was carried out under very difficult conditions and was severely punished enough -- one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
The military information analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, was accused of exceeding thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and gave her answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment he had reserved for his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was globally "very professional."
The complainants did not complain of any ill-treatment, although the officers had directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they were concerned, but did not mention the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after dealing with concerns), and, therefore, this did not mean that I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he was not complaining about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee meeting to address the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to modify his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the surveillance approach to the risk of suicide -- for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted him to be removed from my status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning witnessed Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had intended to kill himself when he was in Kuwait and was once separated because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been held responsible for what was going to happen to him or what was happening to the rest of the world was very sad.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mat, a cover, a tongs, clothes and his moons.
He tried to stay in motion, as sleeping or staying extended during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also explained that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he returned at night, they would wake him so that he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for the handling by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also raised questions in Manning about a claim reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand before guards and other inmates one morning while calling.
Manning testified that at any time he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the court's questions, on Friday, Manning said he had failed to order his guard that he should hide his cover which could have concealed his innocence, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to leave it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used his sleigh or tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his clothes, his tongs, and his lunches had been removed from his cell.
Its lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experience he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his judgment if he should be found guilty before a court, a trial that should be held early in the next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to be guilty of the most serious crimes and to fight for the removal of other excessive charges.
The hearing should take place this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the flight of public goods or documents, the collusion with the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the prosecution leaders are detained, it is a crime to be punished forever.
But Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who are involved; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult periods, he said.
Navarret said that the Mexicans found themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexico" ("Mexico"), another for the "Extrajeros" ("External").
I've been in real estate for several seconds, not knowing which file to direct me.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called "Mexico" all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, as well as my friends from Boston use it when they call themselves Irish, or my friends from New York when they say "Italians".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the ground that my father was born, there was no need for special qualifications or union training.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have an autochton vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I was directed to the "Eternals" file.
I was thinking about this week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the House-Blanche.
In general, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their pre-election themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans remain in Mexico rather than risking themselves to the United States.
He wanted to join the United States and Canada and create a Union for trade in the European Union model, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of amethymia.
Most Americans have probably never reflected on the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender in writing half of their territory to the point of gunfire.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as a U.S. official makes the most critical statement about Mexico, you begin to understand -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints about how Americans deal with the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for the bakery.
For Mexico, however, the most difficult relationship is that the country has more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of amortem?
There's a lot of it.
Mexico has its winners and losses, persons for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one time, in our genetic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponds to a type of profile -- a lean, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living in the American dream, that we are going to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we live, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
We also know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humble defect and they attract us as if we were individuals of lower taste and not quite Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is a shadow of failure.
If our families had not forgotten when they lived in Mexico, they would never have been part of it.
And we did not find the right side of the barrier, living in comfort to the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are conflicts between Mexicans and Mexicans, as Mexicans claim more firmly to their identity and Mexicans are opposed.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like becoming part of two countries.
Also, many Mexicans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another.
We worship the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein's.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rationalized in either of them.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want Mexicans to work as successful ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that absolutely needs to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much love for me.
And, if we consider wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to go out alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them to do so in the manner in which their family members have been treated for so long.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Necessaries, New Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is yet another obstacle to peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another flow of blood seems to indicate that such hope is empty.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, ten buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, the rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab spring has done everything in vain, and whether or not we want it, the Palestinians and the Israelis are trapped by this regional turmoil.
Perhaps their fight will intensify a little more.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly trap.
A war that doesn't make anyone lose or win.
At first, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November continues, the fighting this week has strengthened both sides of the force.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement leading the Gaza Strip since 2007, will have tried to force the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has released a raid.
Having killed some of its leaders and renouncing the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overwhelmed corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is from the territory of Cisjordan, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian tribe.
In addition, Hamas' leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a full-fledged regional power, sometimes the closest Muslim alliance to Israel, has made and caused for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas are jubilant and say that the growing Islamist is moving around Israel from Lebanon to the north, where the army of Hezbollah exercises its power through Syria, where rebel Islamist tendencies can reverse Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the mount of Muslim Brothers under the leadership of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far the most popular and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to spend in Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who will no longer be excluded even from Israel and America.
During this time, the parties to the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was released in box.
The baptized Iron Dome missile interception system proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its support indeficiency; and many European countries have called on Hamas to be the source of the last wave of violence.
But, above all, Israel has benefited, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide attacks, including through the barrier of separation that engulfs the Jordan, the main scourge of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to extend their illegality in respect of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose part of the Lukud was merged with another more beautiful party, the one of Governor Avigdor Lieberman's near the election on 22 January, has a beautiful party.
Why do these Palestinian figuring them out?
If they were driving the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their co-compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and strike them as soon as they get out of their head.
Maybe the parties on the line will take it long; but the Arab spring may change her.
Although Islamists who exercise power in Egypt and others appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The budget for Israel's defence is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local sovereignty will not help the new Arab governments to organize their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a stop of what's good hope -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, privatizing Palestinians with their right to self-determination could create a drought that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography increases this problem as the Arab population grows.
Bloodless missions against Gaza every two or three years for Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.
Both sides need to be moved by those outside.
The answer remains the one provided by the reasonable individuals found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this journal: two states, with a passage of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the cease-fire will give people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to put an end to the movement of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with trade in land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of foreign countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama was also interested in Israel ' s willingness to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own plan of peace.
From returning to the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarettes packages are in force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick bodies reveal the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the mark
This law entered into force in Australia is the first world, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photos of sick bodies and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since this Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest system in the world with regard to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government stated that the objective was to discourage young people from smoking by deleting any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they're very young, children include the message that tobacco manufacturers use through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed for example that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia registers the lowest smoking rate in the world and if these changes have little effect on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pressed against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have stated that this would slow down the trade in the black market, which will make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"The consequences of this legislation will be the result," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
China and Indonesia's fascists will see more anti-smoker cigarettes in Australia's streets.
Others have stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes, including silicon to mask the terrible packaging, has increased strongly two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost it in front of Australia's high court.
He said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only advantage, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the cut-off of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertising on TV, sports sponsoring and the obligation for sellers to discriminate against cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local websites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you have only a little wine to promote your products," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of certain citizens to Lambda for social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves whether it's a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been punished for making a video, or whether it's a marketing campaign organized by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulation rather than on marketing.
The industry has left to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in response to these new judicial decisions - these countries have declared to the WTO that trade is fairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had important trade negotiations with Australia.
A decision of the WTO should be taken in the spring of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now being delivered in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you turn the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a picture of the tumor of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packages made it difficult for the packaging to be installed on the warehouses.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a college, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had just forbidden them a good time for all and we would have said OK, it's good, we're stopped and the key is put under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to wake up.
I spent five hours at a airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of the novel.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty bad, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting Duty-free shops).
But more than that, some university students and experts specializing in the development of the child are leaving the nest.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to use interesting paths, i.e. to feed creativity.
And as most of us are constantly facing multiple types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of the ennuin.
So should we welcome the bride to open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be back.
First of all, in the eyes of many people, I thought that the ennuin was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Level History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The snow goes very far," he said.
There are Latin graffiti on the walls of Pompey, which call the ennui, and they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to the bride.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed in various ways, John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After several publications and the idea was given to a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues identified the phenomenon as an experience consisting of "a desire to do something, but without being able to engage in satisfying activity."
What distinguishes the nose from the liver, he says, is that the person is not in the process of doing a job as long as she wants it.
With the patia, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the bride, he said, is "the interrupting of the attention process, associated with a poor mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly."
The nose can be very like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who complain tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are sick while it is because of a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Bored in Terms of Attention", which was published in the September journal "Privacys on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard from the next room its very high TV broadcast that had no reports, others have just heard the TV broadcast, and the third group has not heard the sound band.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they were more upset than the other two groups - they were too bad to concentrate, but they didn't know why, and they assigned this problem of concentration to the nose.
When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, an interruption of attention can lead to the innuendo, Mark J. Fenske, an associate neuroscientist at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study authors.
On the contrary, when you do an unpleasant task, "how to look at objects on a assembly chain, music can help you not to mourn."
In fact, he said, now we know that when we are tortured or fluffed, these gestures, often considered as signs of annuity, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigote learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without movement," said Professor Fenske.
We all miss one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly poor movie.
But some people are more likely to be upset than others.
In order to measure this, researchers have developed a "pre-delegation scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Of the tasks I do, many of them are repeatative and monotonous," and "I have so much interest centres that I don't have time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to be more prone than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied incentives.
However, in general, adolescents are fast-paced.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development teacher at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience that he and his parents contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a baby.
He noted that 32 percent of adolescents said they were nervous at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent said they were nervous when they were not at school.
On the contrary, 3 percent of parents said they were nervous.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's percentages, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "Adolescence is a period when the bride reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I answer my question, is the ring good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it may cause people to take absurd physical risks, to take medications, or to abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the contrary, many philosophers and writers mention a link between ennui and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The nose is the way the brain found to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the U.S.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are tired and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child ignores himself and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-regulatory, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulatory goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more master of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the bride.
As far as I don't think we should criticize him.
It's easy to feel out of the constant noise generated by activities and technology is the goal to which we should focus.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to be angry more often, but the young man raises an acute and curious desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for, it's a way to disconnect and appreciate the time of the end.
"In a environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a college and football player in Colorado, is guilty of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana bottles and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the camps, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received an invitation to compare for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each with an amount of $100 - and a date of comparison.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without delay.
Police services have ceased to involve adults aged 21 years and more for minor possession of Marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in the most conservative areas of Colorado called for the acceleration of existing marijuana business and continued to accuse the people who owned it.
At the same time, several towns from the banks of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of trades in Marijuana, which are approved by the State in their districts.
"It's happening so quickly that I don't know what's behind us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora Police, in the east of Denver.
The Washington State regulatory bodies are also not in trouble.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the initial date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is wanted or not, is advanced in most of the regulations on marijuana, first in terms of use for therapeutic purposes and now in terms of personal use.
"Colodo has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognized by Mr Smith, can do much more than suggest what works.
"There is no previous reality on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of a year, during which the permit system will not always exist, while the possession of Marijuana will be legal.
During this period, practical questions remain: how to balance the state's mandate, which ensures appropriate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of trade in cannabis in a 30 km radius around a school, park, game area or crack.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved trade in cannabis sales, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the cannabis Law Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, police chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that "City attorney" (the representative of the public ministry) would no longer continue the people of 21 years and more who own small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop indicting people for this kind of crime "to immediate effect."
The Chief Oates stated that the police would implement new justice decisions regulating the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
At the World County, north of Colorado, the "District Attorney" (Republic Prosecutor), Ken Buck, has a more narrower vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to quit.
At present, 119 persons are guilty of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are guilty of other offences.
"Our office has a duty to try to prosecute these people who committed a crime that, in fact, was a recognized crime," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complex even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compares adults for limited quantities.
The representative of the State Department of the County, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't have the impression of wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework suitable for the personal consumption of Marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalentity among local officials with regard to the legalization of the Marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people charged with marijuana consumption and who acts as the local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a good part of their lives in pursuing justice for people who consumed marijuana, too, have had the wrong to accept that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are in the process of becoming a case of case-law for the legalization of drugs.
While defencers and State representatives provide for a new legalised border of sales, they wait with concern for the federal government's directives, which always recognises the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of Marijuana expect the Ministry of Justice to resign.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has specifically allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are not likely to force the doors to take small drug bags, it is strongly opposed to the commercially accepted marijuana sale for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, an old policy adviser to Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not expected federal authorities to act.
Prior to the vote, some local administrations approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if only one year's report is concerned.
Last week, the city of Montrose received a 6-month moratorium, and this ban should be imposed the next week.
"We do not want to find us in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find us faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the Community's vote rather than the State's vote.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
This is not only the students today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and brother-in-law have studied what was a remarkable place for me to know, a kind of Greek modern-day amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study history, I decided to make my own currencies, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father got tired and started crying.
My friends were convinced.
The standard Evening newspaper claimed that I had left this university, because I had intended that students of the first class had sexual relations in my room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson stated with interest that I was a party after having been forced to drink in dried bags.
The truth was less expensive.
I went.
Yes, I was, because I was the victim of intimidation and made the object of constant applause.
Not because of my name but because I'm from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single and only reason, and in this self-evident embrace, I was victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why call that today, you tell me.
However, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-wing students is facing the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them called for protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of the Student's Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt helpless" because of their political views.
They want a representative of the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary published on BBC Two "Wenderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of Miracles: Youth, Intelligents and Rights"), dedicated to the policy of students, and which highlighted "Tories" as eccentrics and neonoxes.
In particular, student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, grows a full silver and moves with a chromed head cannon.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as issuing mouths for setting up higher school fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham Conservative Association, said on a Sunday newspaper that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, studying history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, says that such a climate is "unsatisfying", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the UCA, said there was a deterioration in the attitude of members of the JCR towards people who are at the centre of the right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think of fate during my first weeks in Oxford.
I arrived in September 1986, then 18 years old and a paralysing timidity.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
Last year, the university had voted in favour of refusing to grant Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinian vibrations.
From the first day of the week of the reception, when the new students introduced themselves to the others and teachers, I had an advance of what was going to happen next.
I found out that the teachers not only participated in the workshops against the Tory students, but, more importantly, they enjoyed it.
It was as if the government's policy on pregnant minors, privatization and opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa had been severed in the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victimized was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Mr. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "Please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a dirty face, was easily brought in.
"Is it that the Thatchrists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were laughing.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he started out of a garnish.
I'm back in my room, inconsolable.
During the dinner night there, I sat alone and I felt a little bit stuck on my shoulder.
He was a second year student of English studies, James, who presented himself as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I'm afraid he's like that.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken for purpose.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (travallists).
Later on, at the local pub, I've been trying to hide.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That strategy failed me.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences, who, unfortunately, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have rehearsals.
I was confused, Sale.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're touching each other, aren't they?"
I feel like homosexuals before liberal legislation for the next six years.
Would I have been able only to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same viewpoint only after nightfall?
Would I have to become a Labourer and renew my opinions?
The next three years would be like a Purgatory of Ostracism and Isolation.
The only open Professor Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history teacher who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative but also because he was advised in Thatcher's foreign policy and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his attachment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started making the boat between Oxford and the home of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford in the forty years, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dream bells.
Even my Communist friends had inseparable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's to take you.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
My frequent journeys to London made my emotional resistance gradually deteriorate.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up on his convictions.
During a work meeting the following week, when another professor of history suggested that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Smelling inside of shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brain washing and treatment of "old fats".
The recovery was short-lived.
He's my father who's stuck the last seal of my oxfordian circle.
At this time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they left, I took my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with a pleurnicharded powder.
But no 18-year-old should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 prime ministers, but also benefited from an immeasurable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
" Valentino prefers elegance to notority "
As part of the exhibition " Valentino: a Master of the Couture " , opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
During the opening of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", the curator recognized it as a prestigious retrospective that brought together more than 130 high-cost models created for its house of worship over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his enemy Italian accent.
This exhibition is the point of pride of a story whose only protagonist is "the lord" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until March 3rd, a impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the aristocratic cream were found, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: the modest corridor of the city of Voghhera, north of Italy, to the worship of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving kingdom.
"At least they don't exaggerate their cigarette tastes on your great tapes like some pop music stars," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular guest and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all worship to be invited to his chalet of Gstad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauty of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza with a Valentino model
The Argentine Mangleuin, Valeria Mazza, has no longer forgotten the charisma of the Couturier.
A few years ago, after a break on the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
He was seen and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Court week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go through fashion, because its creations are works of art," she concluded.
Nobblese Line Defile
Garavani's life is not an obsessive story but shared love.
He loves the tallest people and with the greatest titles and also loves them.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a six-metre glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to stand on the podium to admire a "public" dreaming of Valentino's main creations, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the custom that Monica Vitti wore in "The Night", or a dress in line and provided with the emperor Farah Diba.
Among these mannequins are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thorn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norvege, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Bascal and the driver in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "not forgetting".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette, and a dress from the 1971-1972 autonomous collection.
"It's a gift he had done to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the coastal museums.
"I prefer it to everyone else for his feminity, his great love for women, and because it enhances our beauty," added the former Duke of Peria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion Patricia della Giovanmpaola d'Arenberg can no longer forget the first time she had a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her clothes for dinner...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a volleyball jukebox, a bust, and a fallout.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is independent of the fashion, he is obsessed with the contemporary," explains the Italian aristocracy that divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg preserves the night's clothes with "the greatest care, because a night's dress is not just a dress, it is also the whole memory of her vehicle".
The King of Mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Cantal Miller held during his marriage with Paul de Grece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the cook calls his cousins) to realize this dress in his own wild with iron intrusions, twelve different kinds of teeth and a four- and-a-half-metre train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the superior authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cost of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Noted for years by the "know-how" of Christmas, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Letters, decorated by the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani gathers as many honours as any husband of his clients.
"They are refined, their calm, their healthy and perfect appearance have always touched my eyes," acknowledged Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was imperceptible, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The Hardest Meteer of the World: Kawah Ijen's Human Mushrooms
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of suffering through the rocky stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their lives by suffering from the Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphic gas from the ends of the earth is solidified in the air.
After collecting large rocks of suffering, which lasts almost 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo pans that he carries on his shoulders through the sandy trails.
There is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that rises to 2,386 meters high, but the authorities are able to place more than 40 minutes to record this distance, at a distance of torture, by keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they do not break and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fault could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who lost a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen's minors earn 5 cents of euro per kilogram of suffering.
Once on high, there is a road between tourists who photograph them as if they were circusy babies, and carrying heavy pants, they walk 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has set a bit opposite to 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrinbi, a company operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents) per kilogram of suffering.
It then sells it to 10,000 rubies (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to produce pipes, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamites and even white sugar.
"As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rubies (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who generally makes three trips a day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138 000 clothes (EUR 11,50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a nightmare for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rubies (1,20 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rubies (167 euros)," says the porter who sometimes worked as a machinon on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rubies (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult as it was, but he returned close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, it is also undisputable that he suffered: "I married a young daughter of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to become Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, everything constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three years at risk of Kawah ljen, but his suffering had already begun to pay him the bill, since he covered his face with a mask and wore special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, everything constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to keep his dream going.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French" he promises it in a more than acceptable English.
Misguided by life, this sympathetic and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, servant or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a woman.
It divides a mixture of insalubre wood with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because the suffering does not stop yellowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the midst of darkness.
Defining the darkness, Anton descends into the crater by revealing himself with a small lamp fixed in his pocket, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters have spent their pancakes on their shoes from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not been able to extract the suffering to save costs and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their account and are paid on their own.
In addition, they no longer touch one of the 30,000 rubies (2,50 euros) increased by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rubies (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park make it to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human wife.
"This work is done for babies, not for human beings," Madrusin protested, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left college.
He is able to carry up to 110 pounds, making sure he will not stop working "as soon as he can", because he needs money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I won't take my retirement, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the suffering damages the throat and irrigates the eyes when the wind turns and puts the young in the heavy smoke columns that emerge from the volcano, they are so tired that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... which are obviously added to their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the pans.
By balancing the panel on its two, Unainik, 53 years old, can only weigh 50 pounds.
Each day, his companions and his companions extract 15 tons of volcanic suffering, which three trucks transport to the Tamanasari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there by a trail of wild herbs.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, opening several missing teeth.
The mother of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sufferer.
Time is passing, but the perpetuity of generation in generation is one of the most difficult meths in the world: the one that makes the human women of the Kawah lang volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are responsible for this absence of children in the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my husband and a patriot, we fulfill our civil duty and we give life!
These words may seem invulnerable, but in spite of this, or perhaps because of this, the video appeared like a powder training on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polychinella in the shooter" to break the Singapore Christmas rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the beginning of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in an amusing way through this publication.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill their "national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we can make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we feel it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things, such as launching perfumes to pheromones or organizing fast-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not work hard.
So we are saying the following: What is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1,2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it as lightly.
It spends $1,300 per year on politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriage and fatherhood provides up to $15,000 per child, along with maternity leave and the distribution of tax benefits.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the preservation of its leaders and social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was found above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, it was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, head of the marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she explained.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of celibates and delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the reduction of the population has created a feeling among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites that cover a painful genocide against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of taking their salaries to the bottom and not being integrated.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has been aware of its best electoral results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in birth rate has a known impact on the economic growth of a country, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example has also had unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoes box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sales have a great success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they are able to promote a life-style of isolation and discourage promoters who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that his "soldier shoes" are sold much faster than larger houses.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built more quickly than those of larger sizes.
For that reason, it is much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admits that the new standards provide more clear instructions to promoters, which would have been put forward in the streets if they wanted to offer too few housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state-state city.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it would seem that they do not have much effect anymore.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people later return it," says a young framework.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," another youth of twenty years tells us.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, these are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What's private out of line is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the area of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What does this mean in the private area for at least 16 years?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by posting on the Internet of events that would certainly not be shared online?
The newspaper El Periodico interviewed five young boys between the ages of 10 and 15 with frequent users of the toilet.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "the password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not everyone else," he said.
On the FB, I post sympathies or games.
I'll talk to my friends too.
"I won't share one of my photos or anyone who would do the stupid thing," he said.
The young man recognized that it was wrong to publish obscenity photos, persons convicted, crimes or commentaries or violent.
Jorge makes sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his new subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
In fact, her mother knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He would no longer trust anyone who would recommend him as a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The youth has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the last one, he admits not to know 20 people on his list of friends.
"This doesn't bother me because we have something in common, for example, music," he said.
According to the young man, no one made any progress or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I'd just get rid of my account," he confessed.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharp are not foreign to the young man.
A close relative of one of my friends was kidnapped on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He's never on who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He just went through it in private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was tired or nervous.
"Even if I know it's cybersaving," he said.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed in Education and Education, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the aim of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she said.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who has a teacher at Yale University and author of the book "Natural and digital immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a criterion defined on what they should or should not disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters them most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without considering the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that bring them to their attention.
"They say it doesn't matter," she said.
Then, Porras cites some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do this on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you identify photos of parties, ask other people to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do outside the line.
These are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she said.
Monitoring
Estuado Guardia, professor of universities, primary institutes and educators of education, states that it is essential that parents knowingly read the terms of use of social networks.
By understanding each term, they will have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind children that they do not need to talk to strangers.
Unasur's summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The seventh presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) was completed today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 present mandate.
Effe tried several times to access the document signed at the seventh Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the United States, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated that it would be released after the end of the summit and then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that was circulated among journalists was this data from press releases from some of the Governments of the Unasur who were present at your meeting, except the Peruvian speech port.
The only document published during the day was the list of the presidents present, which has caused some dismality among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of the President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In October last, Peru was hosted by the 3rd South American Summit of the Arab States (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was requested by the press, it had not yet published the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published in March.
In your two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Hague Court that covers a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at your regional meeting and said that they respected the decision of the ICJ to listen to the complainants of both parties in the process that Lima attempted against Santiago and that began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the differences we bring today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
" Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country in respect of international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," said President Piñera, handing a hand in hand to President Humala on the shoulders of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents to be submitted to the ICJ took place after Colombia declared this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011 after his ex-President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in your meeting.
The guest president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandater read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 project action lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the United States would put in place "the important steps to achieve the objective of South American citizenship by developing housing permits agreements".
He reported that action would be taken to improve "cooperation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, measures to improve access to drugs, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to assess the risks of natural disasters in a joint and effective manner".
With a crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and bring about a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to privileged a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas... by bringing our country together and by creating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were located on the transverse axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were looking at a more important connection with Ecuador, although he had not given more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the United Nations of South America," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations with its neighbours is another topic addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos stated, before starting your regional meeting, that he would hope to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a decision of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not excessive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will require a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they planned to assist the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, during the summit, the Ministers for the Defence of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the last country is suspended.
Peru guarantees the presidency for a time from the regional block.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should be an example of Europe".
The President of Korea, who participated in the seventh summit of the United Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were busy during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they now formed almost a patriot".
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the United States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as it is already the case for members of the Andine Community, is still in the reactive areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President has shown himself in favour of the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who fight our ears never commit nothing, on the contrary, we, South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he did not live up to his own principles, but has respected his "prolonged democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions based on which Assange would be transferred to a third country and that its process would not be respected".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice that required him to submit himself to a questionnaire on a alleged sexual crime, while "Swedish legislation itself allows him to do it through videoconference, which could have been done since Ecuador's Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is weakened by being confined to a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"It's about anybody's health," he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution given to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the assignment of a safe conduct that would allow him to return to Ecuador, is between the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and points out that there have been discussions in London to find a solution to the rape of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is found in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, launched a series of procedures with different European courts," he said.
And he thinks, "If the Great Britain gave the rescue tomorrow, that would end."
And if Sweden, as it allows it to do its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London, or asked him about Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and explained that what he would not tolerate was "mediocrity, evil faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or evil political men but the evil journalists on the balance of intelligence, singing and exorcism," he said.
Under this angle, he was pleased that this is not such a kind of journalist " neither the banks nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and instead of putting forward its re-election, "the revolution would deepen to continue the way and to follow the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the visa on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "had to show itself firmly and not tolerate the opportunity and attempts to stop the state of dissidents", because in fact, "it would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President considers it “perfectly relevant” the desire of its Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court of Justice, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to move forward together.
They need to be resolved together in order to pass and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the good resolution of the dispute on the maritime frontiers that challenged Peru and Chile within the same court and said that it was "that Latin America would benefit from the international courts if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment."
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, he noted that he saw this opportunity “with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult”.
Correspondence ensured that if he lost the early February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never been of interest to me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who would guarantee this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, that would be my last presidential mandate and I would then withdraw from political life.
If you ever forgive us, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just discussing with Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, and he told me that a routine medical treatment had already been planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a retiring of the health status of President Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State has today participated in Lima at the Fifth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United States of America (Unasur) which has been completed by a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he confirmed the results of the test: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "lower penalty" in wine.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform him about it and his arrest was as soon as he was going to celebrate his 43th anniversary.
There is no doubt that he was one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of human immunodeficiency (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmatization.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic prevented him from saying "because he was without a vote".
At that time, having AIDS was a symptom of death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, despite their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "expressed" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG HIV chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he pointed out that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of impact of the immune system presenting patients at the time of diagnosis, with better perspectives for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a positive 25-year-old HIV diagnosis, "as long as he remains in control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," the asked scientist explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on the average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died from AIDS was 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients reported on the national database have died since AIDS.
Nothing happened to Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to anti-retroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there deaths still there?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
It's like what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know that they are infected, or then they learn about advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact that "nine patients in ten occur when they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to perform earlier diagnosiss and, therefore, it is necessary to propose mass testing tests for all those who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the Jalisco State Council of AIDS Prevention (Cosideda) agree on their proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who have performed their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his age, he was already a victim of AIDS and suffered from the cancer of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the current complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I wake up three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
Today, his parents only know he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the course of the World AIDS Day.
If they've done the test, if they've taken risks, they'll soon be more positive and better this evening, and if they've already been diagnosed, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
Its message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Conservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, supported by Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, who has covered the cause of HIV.
And the largest resident in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, and now we are given 100 packages, it's very good, but as a result, today some have not access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question, "What are you going to do about it?", put on by social workers, guidance advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this ineffective distribution; that conservatives are not only sold to the counters, but are found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places where young people frequent them.
It's not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is no longer about paying the girls and the model, as Governor Emilio González had answered when asked if there was a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not like sexual function, it's best to provide condoms to people already active in sex," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
13,435 cases have been reported (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in number of new cases and cases of AIDS and 13th cases for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of the contamination occurs by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as there are 4 or 5 people who do not.
A judgement ratified by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all national companies with a ramifications in the neighbouring country and with problems of solvency.
Thus, the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the end of the summer, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup brought to trial by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Failures for the northern Texas district of Texas on 15 June, leaves the Mexican companies with no defence against the possibility of enbargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main wine manufacturer from Mexico to obtain the Supreme Court of the United States on three grounds of incoherence.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors are required to register under the U.S. insolvency law, the appeal court of the fifth circuit, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formalized trade failure in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce international cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Equality of International Trade Law had been created to that end by taking the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment established that, without the inter-society vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial failure, the debts incurred by the Fiscals of Vitro against the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are about a dozen examples, including Agrex and Mexican Commercial, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Debts had guaranteed debt.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there were the votes of the branches, in all ways Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have received the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data denied by the Appeals Tribunal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been bloated for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the moment, the family company of the González Sada will appeal to the same appeal court so that the vote has taken place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States will claim the non-profit and require the revision of the trial by a higher court.
Most importantly, the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the Curios Friend ("the Court's Friends") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Trade Errors Act was detailed, indicating that it would release the conventions signed by the two countries to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Law on Errors.
Furthermore, it notes that the country has fallen under the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for creditors and creditors.
Caraboration of two parts: they are as follows Vitro and they are the country.
General
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former parent of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, which has been accused of mismanagement, and the Association of the Aviation Pilots has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal appeal against the National Banking Commission and the Valeurs, who is accused of a violation of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically provided information to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to remove F/589 from the Bank of IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicoan de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase operations from the Professional Department of Hotels.
As each knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're watching Dragon Mart.
Meetings last week in an amphitheater of the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university teachers, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a shopping and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the big wall, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had been able to unite the rulers of the South-East region in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest threat to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The Government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafaçon Commercial Agreement, known as the ACTA's English seal, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already from ancient history.
As everyone knows, this is because the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered an obstacle to freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Home
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting them in short-term, the real estate promoter Homex launched on the market of the Value Exchange for 500 million pesos.
This issue of titles is the first of the four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival’s Birth
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, leaders of information, a new Consortium for Competival's social reasons has been born, with the aim of being the market of software hosting in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is all my life"
The global football champion "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the land and, thanks to it, has traveled throughout the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral haemorrhage did not condemn him in 2008, Reyes was implicated in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a player of lower links, a national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball Federation.
"I've been wearing several basketball helmets all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, head of the National Team and president of the Federation for the 1990s," Reyes recalls when visiting him at Primera Hora in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind his traveler of standards, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
From all his memories, his favorites are those who remind him of his transition as a player within the Vakuros team from the mid-50s to 1982, after 15 years as co-man or team manager.
"It was my best years, which I have enjoyed most because I have had the chance to participate in eight Vacero champions since 1967, whether as manager, co-manor or manager.
This took many years of satisfaction, including the five champions from 1971 to 1975.
I was then removed from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mindy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the team's head," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was leading here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a expensive player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it?"
It's like at the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a champion, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the Váqueros champion with Gausse, but only as far away as 1988 he was already the great manito of the Federation.
At that time, he would prefer to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States during the Mexican pre-Olympical tournament in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not given us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
It is part of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the Spanish games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we took a race to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one who had won the bronze in the World.
This team was not only composed of Mindy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the 90th world due to a problem of gender.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a medal of gold and great joy during the pre-Olympical tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitner instead of players suspended by the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we have won the gold against all prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt it's Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as did Piculin.
And this takes into account his trajectory in the different links he played for.
Who was the best Portuguese leader?
It's very hard to say.
We have a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young person, I love the work that Leo Ariel does.
For you, what is your greatest success within the Federation?
It has been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSN accounted for up to 17 teams in one season.
What are you gonna do?
There are things I would like to put in place, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and face only teams of other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the advantage of compulsory certifications and courses for managers, field personnel and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take advantage of my little children, and, in time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I benefit from my husband's company, Isabel, who has always been beside me.
Killed by actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by John Ross Ewing's main role, known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he engaged a man with no scruples, no-cut, no-cut, no-handling business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnet without screw J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the war in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came this year into the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday evening of complications of cancer, according to a family communication sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., Dallas production house.
"Lary was back in his hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this day's Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted her husband's role in the original series and then met Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, declared his press attack, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, dreaming, loving and talented, and he's going to miss me a lot.
"It was an exception and he lived his life in the background," said Gray in a communiqué.
Doctors had diagnosed a liver surgeon at Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had been very good for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a liver malaise and had a seizure.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman was introduced to television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" published by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
There he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and took it home.
He also played in two comedies that were short-lived, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Heer We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the film are the well received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his excellent interpretation of the malicious J.R. that Larry Hagman knows his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and its neighbours was published from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's personality is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in Paris.
As a result, among others, the series has reached a record of audition at this time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million TV viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most popular entertainment programme in the world, after the final "MASH" episode in 1983, which had collected 50 million TV viewers.
It was J.R.'s beautiful sister, Kristin (translated by Mary Crosby) who had pulled him up.
J.R. had set him on fire and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if he did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but in charismatic smiles: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to interfere with his alcoholic husband, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epithet for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be written: "See the honor of the citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "immortal man, on both the small screen and in life".
It is inevitable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each one of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were published a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The registration of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, reported the chain.
For the moment, neither the Warner nor the TNT chain have reported how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Fort Worth's original in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who knows the celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her day in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first step on the stage of New York’s theatres in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
This is where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived in the California city of Malibu for many years.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolute Truth) Tales about My Life" (French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s imputable memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he said to the press at the time.
After his liver arrest, he became an active soldier of the organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the patients concerned.
"I advise them, I restore their confidence, I come with them when they come to work and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it'll be fine."
He was also a fighter against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with "The End of the World" has just begun.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This month, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course at the end of the world, he knew that he had launched an unresponsible hammock: the end of the "great record" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which referred to many people as evidence of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what he was expecting during the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal nightmare that some have called "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theologians at the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we were talking about it, that was a very good period.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of history.
In the Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker offers the course "Media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas are expanding over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios leads to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and learn how they can be compared to real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of state of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art and Anthropology History, have conducted a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" in order to have the opportunity to give the course back, in case the world wouldn't disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the imminent "disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final review will take place in the wake of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It makes me happy to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychologist and Nursery student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students asked, and less than one professor, told us that we believed in the end date of the 21st December world.
"Our first project was the Maya prophecy, and in some way we have disreputed it," says Julie Zegle, a last year student at Temple, aged 21 and original in West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I realize that there is a concern related to apocalypse in Western culture, which has been rising for centuries, making people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a lot of these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
It's most of the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Hall, who gives courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when he was asked if he knew that there were courses at "the end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a superior authority.
We have a thank you from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, many dates of the last judgment have been discussed, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to think of the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to the light.
Many told us they were thinking about going to "the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we'll be together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
