New issues of the water engineering project in California
Following the Government funding from the administration of a major water management area in the state of California, Jerry Brown, head of State, will be provided with funds to complete the planning of two large watercourses, some commentators and a member of state stated that they would like to know more about the cost of the water engineering proposed to support the governor.
According to the commentator, the Government's funds referred to in the MWD Thursday in Los Angeles may have been a long-term commitment, which stated that, in order to achieve the two 35-mile-long tunnels envisaged by Brown, it would be charged to transport water from the Sacramento River to the south and to provide the vision of the central and southern regions of the state of California.
The initial expenditure of $248 million in these two channels has not yet been approved by the regulatory sector as the subject of the ongoing federal audit.
Some parliamentarians also conducted an internal audit of the costs of pipelines during the third week.
The State's speaker, Nancy Vogel, said on Thursday that although the account was in the municipal water control area of Los Angeles, it would not use any general funds to complete the two ongoing planning stages of the country.
However, the opposition to the pipeline project and a tax-paying group had criticized the Thursday, and one of the state parliamentarians who had ordered this week's audit decree asked Susan Agman to clarify the relevant situation.
David Wolf, Director of the Law of the Howard Javez Tax Association, said: " This is a fraud agency. "
I believe that the issue of yesterday's audit (request) is far from the answer.
The pipeline project was supported by Brown and some of the political areas of water management and water users in central and southern California.
Supporters pointed out that these two channels would make environmental benefits and help the state of California ensure that water supply is safer.
The opposition indicated that they were concerned that the state would be divided over too much water through these two channels from the Sacramento River and the Old Mountain Valley, thus damaging the northern California state and threatening the survival of the species.
Since it is not possible to determine whether such large expenditure can bring water to them to reduce their water prices, it is expected that the associated costs will not be incurred from the water supply and other water supply areas of the major urban water supply sector in the pipeline.
These water management areas have also declared this year that they will not bear the costs of completing the current initial work until the approval of the regulatory sector.
In the fourth week, a monthly report from the water management region of Los Angeles on the pipeline project stated: " The State has indicated that any additional funds needed to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources of funding. "
The spokesman for the Water Management Region of Los Angeles stated that "the State can be expected to use Government funds to help complete the planning phase after the project has been invested in all local water supply areas (including $63 million from its water supply area).
He raised further questions to the State speaker, Vogel.
Vogel stated that the State intended to withdraw funds from the user costs of the existing half-generation water supply network (i.e. state water engineering) for the purpose of completing the planning of the pipeline project.
However, the opposition to the pipeline project referred to a bill adopted by the State parliament in 2009, which said that it prohibited the State from investing in the tunnels unless the affected water sectors committed to the tunnels.
A long-term opposition to the construction of the tunnel, environmental consultant Patricia Squille said: " Project contractors had guaranteed the cost of the project and had avoided this obligation through financial planning. "
So the question is where it can actually be implemented.
The Group of Entrepreneurs appealed to China for the Network Security Act
A Union consisting of an international enterprise group called upon China to amend the proposed network security rules and to warn that those rules would damage trade and put States in isolation.
From the United States, Europe, the 46 groups in Asia and Latin America have signed a strong letter to the Prime Minister of China, Leek, reflecting the global concern over the possible restrictions on network security rules or barriers to access to the Chinese market for information security products.
The signatories include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and numerous groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
China ' s proposed network security rules would require suppliers to demonstrate to the relevant Chinese sector the working methods of displaying security products and to store information on Chinese citizens in China ' s territory.
The latest letter issued on Wednesday noted that this event could make data easier to lose and could reduce access to Chinese customers.
Explosion of ozone-depleting chemicals: a anniversary of the disaster
The dream is that the public should know what happened in the disaster.
China's leaders may wish to commemorate the first anniversary of the major explosion of chemicals that struck 173 people in a loud manner, but not everyone thinks so.
Please look at John Sudwors' story from the sky.
If any other place in the world is affected by this level of disaster, the anniversary of this anniversary will almost reflect a deep resonance of national origin.
In China, however, that is not the case.
The memorial activities held in other places when the city was holding memorials for those who were missing were being held.
The media controlled by the Communist Party are informed of what can be said and what cannot be said, and some survivors and relatives are accused of not speaking out on the media.
But 23-year-old dream doesn't want to remain silent.
"On the anniversary of this anniversary, the public should have a way to know what happened," he told me.
I don't want to be quiet.
On 12 August last year, Mr. Ting was a radio-telephone servant of a military-owned fire team whose station was only a mile away from the station.
He said, "The phone was called at 10:53 at night, and then we started sending my teammates."
They'll be here in 10 minutes.
Firemen from other parts of the city also arrive on land to cope with the fires of a chemical warehouse.
All of them probably did not realize that the presence of obsessives had a large number of functional and toxic substances, far beyond the permitted amount, and were not properly managed.
At that time, a mixture of evaporative fluids (a chemical supply for oil) was allowed to be used for the treatment of lead and then fuelled at high temperatures in the summer and caused a fire.
Next, a large amount (800 tons) of carbon dioxide-depleting areas were added to the stock.
As a result, the explosion destroyed the windows of the fire station and led to the collapse of the house, waiting for a report from the fireplace on the radio.
However, those reports will no longer come.
"When I saw the black cloud, I fell in despair," he said to me.
I know what it means to my friends.
That night, his fire station sent 26 firemen to the camp, eight of whom had not returned.
Many of the survivors suffered severe burnout and other injuries.
In two major explosions, the largest explosions were observed as one earthquake and the explosions could still be felt outside many kilometres.
The total losses resulting from disasters amount to more than $100,000, including more than 300 damaged buildings.
A total of 173 victims, 104 of whom were firemen.
There are eight victims who have not been found.
As a result of official government investigations, the responsibility for corruption, political relations and officials has been linked to the closure of the operation of the horse and safety systems.
The building should not be built in a place so close to the house.
More than 100 officials and business officials are in a position to face an intrusion or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the Government may indicate the progress made, such as the rehabilitation of thousands of homes and the compensation of residents, there is still a sensitive problem.
The disaster has revealed a system breakdown, in which rapid economic growth has been a priority, and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of no dispute.
There is no doubt that the courage and responsibility displayed that night, but firemen as heroes are another difficult picture.
That is a picture of the firemen as the victims, and they were sent to a place of escape, where they could not be certain.
The dream is now out of the fire sector, but it will be part of the memorial celebration.
He's going to say a word in his heart for missing friends.
I'd like to tell them that I went to see your parents, and they're all good.
Give me your parents.
Now I'm your family.
I'll do my best for you.
The cold winter may affect the course of the Sioux-Suklan fishing season.
Due to the decline in the number of frozen fish this year, the season for skirmishing in Scotland will be delayed.
Since many early chickens have not survived in this cold spring, some gardens have been fishing for a long time.
In opening the opening speech for the season of fishing, the SCO said that it was possible to maintain more working opportunities compared with the days of the Ettenburg Festival.
One Kind, however, called for the end of the cruel killing of these birds.
The leader of the organization, Harry Haeton, said: “Keeping a rich bird in the fishing area for hunting requires considerable work, and always involves some very controversial practices. ”
This is hardly surprising that the public is gradually taking a negative view of the so-called mode of movement and calls upon the Government to consider it a cruel and unnecessary practice for some very small people in the Soviet Union.
However, those owners of land maintained that they were committed to protecting and that hunting was crucial to the rural economy.
Alex Hogg, Chairman of the Association for the Protection of Birds of the Sugland Fisheries Association, said that the industry maintained 8800 full-time jobs in the remote regions each year and became a "commissioned band" in some uncertain periods.
He said: "In comparison with many other European countries, there is no ‘fish’ culture in Scotland, and many people do not understand the economic impact of fishing season on the country. "
Mr. Hogg pointed out that the number of full-time jobs dependent on hunting exceeded the total number of jobs created by the Ettenburg International Art Festival, the Border Art Festival, the division of performances and the elimination activities.
He added: "The region of the village of Sugland has an effective concern about employment, particularly in oil and natural gas areas, and therefore the presence of fishermen and their families in the sector is a source of interest. "
We wish to cooperate with the Government of Sweden to ensure that those who work hard can continue to rely on these jobs in the future.
The British Royal Birds Protection Association believes there are eight pounds of illegal hunting around the fishing grounds.
Many fishermen recognize that fishing is not generally welcome, but the Association of Sugland Birds observed that the industry "has made significant progress in best practice".
The opening day of the season of skirmishing is traditionally called "the 12th of the season."
However, there is still controversy about the conservation activities that the management of skirmish fishing sites has been marked by a number of wildlife protection organizations.
In the fourth week, the British Royal Birds Protection Association stated that within five years, eight of the gold marks had disappeared from the Monaria Mountains in the southeastern part of the city of Fernez.
The animal welfare agency believed that the gold was illegally slaughtered around the fishing grounds and their satellite tracking marks were destroyed.
Rosana Kaninan, Minister of the Environment of Scotland, said that these reports were "very disturbing and disappointing".
Ms. Kaninen has been commissioned to analyse the signs of signs of signs of signs of signs of signs of signs of almost 90 survival and disappearance in order to determine whether any form of suspicious activity exists.
The Sugland Fisheries Group accused the Royal Birds Protection Association of trying to reverse the conditions of hunting before the season of skirmish, and indicated that there was no precise evidence that these sharks actually died in the area of Monaria.
Rio de Janeiro, 2016: Bucony Pesch has drawn a bank card for Britain
Peck of England got a bank card in the bedroom project.
The Bucony Pecchiro bank is the first British women's activist to win the Olympics.
Peck's 25-year-old success in the race was less than 0.425 points lower than the gold medal, while Canadian winner Rosana McKrennan won the 56,465 UNOAM champions.
China's winner, the World Championshipdian, and another British winner, Catherine Driscoll, has won the sixth.
I can't believe I've won the Olympic Award.
"I'm really happy.
I didn't think I could win a prize, but I did my best, so I'm happy that all the training and hard work have come back.
I'm happy to be able to join Katherine in the race, and we have two.
Peck's best performance in the international race before winning the Olympics was the fifth in the 2015 World Cup in Denmark.
It was the first time the Olympic Games were held in 2000, the first time the Olympics were won by British women's voters.
Get a response after the prize.
The British delegation was pleased to hear that the only male voter, Nathan Belly, who was held on Saturday's sixth floor of the men's bed project.
Hana Vilan, a physical activist who participated in the two ossuaries, commended Peck for his achievements.
Peggy has a prestigious degree in biology at the University of Field.
Rio de Janeiro, 2016: Fijio celebrates the 7th anniversary of the Olympics.
A 12-year-old boy ran out of Gandhi to watch the game.
After Fiji won its first Olympic prize, the event was not uncommon.
The bank shuts the door, knocks down the store, and the mobs occupy the streets of the capital of Suva, dancing and singing.
In the seven football matches held at the Douro sports stadium, the Fijian team won the gold medals with 43 to 7 winning the British team.
As many as a million people on the island have put their hands on this creative game.
Fiji is pleased to have the first Olympic prize in history.
Many supporters are dressed in colorful phytosanitary clothing and towels with national flags.
At the moment of the final blast, a mob of crazy people flocked to the street and shouted.
"Some people even stopped their car on the busy streets of Suva and took the flag of Fiji to join the celebration, ignoring the light traffic jams they caused. "
The event will certainly continue until the end of the week and the next week.
Ireland's Super Football League: Fenn Hap 0-5, no enemy city.
Alan McNiffe went to the camp at half of Finn's park.
The 5-0 Grand Fen Hap, the Deli City team rose to the second in the League's list.
Two and a half-pounds of Arlen McNev have been active in the Deli City Army, both of which have been acquired because of Lucas Schubert's theft.
In the second half of the runoff, Nathan Powell attacked the fourth ball, followed by the late Cass Ward to win the Finn Park.
Dili's city team is headed a little earlier than Cook City, and they're going to be fighting a fight in the Whiteville camp on Sunday night.
This was the first victory in the three matches of the north-western opponents in the course of the Deli City War, which showed that the poor Fenhap had hardly caused any trouble.
Although the order appears to be outside the football field, after Sharon Corl's rules against Schubert, McNev rushed into the first ball in 17 minutes.
There is no doubt that the second round of punishment was the defeat of former Deli City football team member Bari Moloi, so Mikenev will be re-enlarged to 2-0 in the first three minutes.
Once again, eight minutes after the ball was opened, Poultry used Dean Javez's turn to a ball.
Dili's security guard, Gerald Dohetide, has spent a night of nothing but he has also done a great rescue and has fired David Skali at the best air-conditioning stage in his main game.
In 83 minutes, Schubert had shot down the Kohl bomber in the door, and soon Ward was crossing the San Francisco Buffy among Fennhap's spectators.
The game was the greatest victory of the Deli City in the League, setting a solid foundation for a victory with the Cook City.
The University of the Highlands and the Islands has failed to find a great deal of failure in the course of the University of Phoenix.
A total of 20 students may not have been able to study high-level media courses managed by the University of Hautes and the Islands through the University of Fernez.
The majority of students in this course are 17 and 18 years old and wish to enter the university to borrow the results of their studies.
The University of the Highlands and the Islands indicated that the quality assurance process of the school was in regular operation and that the SQA was also conducting investigations.
One speaker from the Swedish Academic Management Committee stated that the 2016 national high-level media assessment has been "precisely carried out".
The twenty students were enrolled in this course, managed and recorded by the University of the Highlands and the Islands.
Many of these students were young people from rural areas who accepted online courses, but they often had to move from their place of residence (such as Lohabre) to the school in Frenez.
One of the fathers of one of the students said that his daughter did not receive at least 10 other students after placing her work on social media, and that they did not receive any courses.
He told the British Broadcasting Company's online news network, Scotland, that last year there were also about five other students who attended the same course at the University of the Highlands and the University of the Islands because of studying at the University of Fernnes.
This situation meant that his daughter was unable to secure access to the University of Graz, but because she had acquired some resources during the course of her studies, she would be able to obtain a scholarship from another university.
However, the girl's father said that the other students who studied the school's media course were not so lucky that they were now "prepared" and did not know whether their courses would be re-examined and given enough to allow them to enter college.
The University of Enfennes is a subsidiary of the University of Haute and the Islands.
The University of the Highlands and the Islands said by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the University of Phoenix: " We deal very closely with the student ' s test results and academic achievements. "
The excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year, as well as the continuing progress we have made in the field of education and higher education over the past year, is evidence.
As we will do every year, we are reviewing all the achievements announced and comparing them with the expected distribution of each student.
With regard to this specific course, the regular quality assurance procedures are implemented, and the award of the institutional auditors has recently reported that "the award and management of the study is a significant advantage" and that the assessment carried out "has been confirmed in accordance with national standards".
At our request, the SCO is currently conducting an investigation on this matter.
One speaker of the Swedish Academic Management Committee stated: " We are pleased that the 2016 High Media Assessment is expected to be conducted and that it provides opportunities for researchers to demonstrate their understanding of the subject " .
A-Cda standard rate in terms of quality is very strong in many surveys, and we see a small increase compared with last year's.
The design of the test is consistent with the previous sample volume and sample volume, and is consistent with our course and evaluation standards.
Two brothers were sent to prison in the Kimmanok Wards.
Jason Braden was attacked by a sword, a spear and a pair of rifles.
Two suspects were imprisoned, and the crime was a drug-related robbery and followed by a "blood washing", killing a man with a gun.
Victim Jason Braden, aged 38, was rehabilitated on 5 July 2015 when he was attacked in his home in Kilmanok.
In the Supreme Court of Graz, 36-year-old James Clark was charged with murder and sentenced to at least 22 years in prison.
His brother John, aged 38, was charged with a minor murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
When the brothers were accused of entering prison, Judge Bill Huypa said that they had committed "a cruel, cruel, wild attack".
He refused to accept any argument about Mr. Braden with a gun that had been kept waiting for them.
Judge Xiao-Pu adds: "You use at least one of the tops and doubles to engage in illegal interference. "
Although Jason Bradden may be a drug dealer, he is also a human son, a man's father and a friend.
You killed him.
After two of them were sentenced, Detective David Moran, responsible for the disappearance of the case, said: " The cruel actions of James Clark and John Clark have led to the death of Jason Bladen. "
Under 38 years of age and under such terrible circumstances, it was heartbreaking and the families of the victims were subjected to torture.
According to a statement previously heard by the Court, this man from Kilmanoc decided to rob Mr. Braden of a gold ring, which they handed to him as a substitute for drugs.
Both of them went to the victim's home after drinking and taking drugs, wearing a ring and a pair of arms.
Killing dogs is believed to be the object of the dead.
Neighbors indicated that they could see Brother Clark attacking Mr. Braden because he sat on the couch next to the window and could hear him crying.
In a statement by the Tribunal, the prosecution, Richard Kodade, said: " What is done is a continuous and insane attack on the victims. "
Then, the murder scene is described as a "blood washing".
In addition to the beatings, Mr. Braden was also injured in the course of an attack.
Three days later, he died at the Croshos Hospital in Kirmanook.
The brothers denied the murder.
At the time of his testimony, 38 previous sciences, including an innocent James Clarke, said: "I didn't intend to do this. This is an accident."
John Clark, of the 23 previous Section, said that he was involved in this matter only to help his brother because his brother claimed that he was being attacked by Mr. Braden.
A man died in prison because of a terrible childhood.
David Sinclair acknowledged that his child was killed in 2012 in a home in eastern Kirbrid.
The man was sentenced to three months in prison for seven years to be severely beaten with a fever without food.
On 6 December 2012, in the home of Kirbrid, South London, David Sinclair, a four-month-old yogurt in the state of "uncontrol" for only four months.
The cause of death was found only after a case review by medical experts.
Sinclair, 34 years old, was initially charged with murder, but he said that he had been sentenced to death from a light trial.
When he was sentenced to prison in the High Court of Graz, Judge Lod Blackdale said to Sinclair: "You have been attacked by a son of a bitch who lives in the baby's life and has caused him fatal harm. "
You must have known that you did it to him, but you didn't reveal it.
It's only after a lot of medical research, that you admit what you've done.
Your wife trusts you.
Now she feels like she's getting you wrong and she can't support you anymore.
Lod Blackdale said that the death of Jokoda caused " a sad " effect on all concerned, adding: "There is nothing that can make Jokoda return to the human being."
On the day before the court was informed of the death of the child, Sinclair and his wife, Cresti, went to the bathroom and then to the purchases of East Kirbrid.
17:30, Coursty Sincley went out to find her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes ago, she got a call from Sinclair, and his voice sounded like "frequency."
He said to her, "The book's not breathing. Come home quickly."
Then he cut the phone off and called 999.
The baby was rushed to Hemmel's hospital and died in the hospital.
At first, the causes of the death of Yokoya were not determined, but the medical expert group reviewed the case and found evidence that the eyes and brains had been affected by accidents when the time of death approached.
A member of the Group of Experts, Dr. Peter Richards, Counsellor for Child Experimental Sciences at the Hospital of Ouxinladcliff, said: " Such evidence shows that the baby has suffered more severe injuries than the normal use of everyday life. "
Defence counsel, King's Legal Counsel, Ian Dugett, said to the Tribunal that Sinclair felt "very sorry about what he did".
Rio de Janeiro, 2016: Chloe Taton seems to be questioning Yulia Chafimo.
The British electorate Taton lost 200 meters of ice cream.
When Russian fighters led her to the wall in the 200-mile swimming project, British winner Chloe Taton seemed to have questioned the current Rio de Janeiro event of the contestant.
After an appeal against an incentive ban, Zfimo was allowed to race and draw a bank card, and Taton received the fourth name.
The 20-year-old traveler from Wales later said, "I wish it was a completely clean game."
I can't wait to see who's in the race.
Although I'm not happy, the fact is.
The Army's recipient, Zifimov, still knows whether he was allowed to compete three days ago.
Although I don't want to see anyone refused to participate in the campaign, I don't think that is the right approach.
She shouldn't be in the race, and a 20-year-old British winner should have a prize.
Kinjii defeated the army's winner, Zifmowa, and won the seventh gold medal for the Japanese team at the Rio Stadium in 2016.
China's voters, S.H.I.E.L.L.L., took the lead in the fourth list of Tatones only 0.06 seconds.
Another British team in Taton, 20-year-old Molly Lance, got the sixth.
Taton adds: "No matter who, it's a little boring to get the fourth one."
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed with the success of the fourth.
I'm in the middle of the prize. That's a dream.
However, the entrance to the contest itself is a great experience, and I will be encouraged for the next few years.
It's kind of boring, but it makes me stronger in the future, and it makes me more eager to get a prize, and I hope that the next time I get closer to the prize.
Taton only recorded 0.01 seconds in the women's 200-mile swimming game.
"Every man should have a second chance."
She expressed concern about the past response to her use of stimulants and defended her right to participate in Rio.
She was banned in 2013 for 16 months as a result of finding a composite sign of congenital contagion.
The International Sports Arbitration Tribunal (CAS) provides that it is not possible to prohibit them from participating in the Rio event for drivers who have previously been vaccinated.
The International Sports Arbitration Tribunal heard my appeal, and I won.
She explained: " If someone does not like and disagrees, they may go to the International Sports Arbitration Tribunal. "
I don't support the use of incentives or the use of incentives.
It's not my fault.
Everyone should have a second chance.
When you drive and get a penalty, no one's gonna lock you in jail.
Ben Plod, 50 meters free swim.
In the early days, Ben Prud was attacked by a 50-millimeter-free skirmish of successful men recorded in the British record.
The 21-year-old British Federation championed the success of the 21-54-second Pludes with a score of five-weekly-qualifications at the fifth level (in the summer of England, at 02:44).
Your delegation is both rude and rude.
The Indian Minister of Sports Vijay Gor, a prominent observer at the Rio event, often appeared on the table to pour oil on Indian actors and film themselves after the race.
However, according to Toras, India's reports indicate that he and many of his colleagues had apparently provoked the anger of Ossetian officials, who tried to enter the region without adequate evidence, and spoke rudely at the time of inspection.
Vijay Gor (photo of July) made a defense of his actions.
On Wednesday, following attempts by Gol and his followers to enter the restricted areas of the gymnasium and the race of the bats and rabbits, the Ossombudspersons issued a warning that, if he no longer did any improvement, he would have to withdraw his mandate.
In a letter from the Rio Group in 2016, Sir Sarah Peterson wrote: "We have received many reports that your sports ministers are trying to bring unauthorized personnel into the area where they are authorized to enter. "
Staff reported that when they tried to explain the situation, a ministerial officer had become a good fighter and a rough one and had been encouraging staff several times.
In the letter, he wrote: "If our charity team is again informed of such acts, the membership of the Minister of Sports of your party will be abolished and his privileges in the Olympics will be abolished."
The head of the delegation of India said that the incident was "but not an issue" and the Gorbian said that he had done nothing wrong and had made it a "miss".
He said on Twitter: "As far as I know, we always follow all the rules and regulations."
We are committed to the Olympic spirit and support our Indian voters.
Otherwise, this is a tragic ossation for India, and as yet there is no reward for it.
Disillusioned fans say on social media that Michael Phillips has already won 26 awards, as well as the total number of awards in India's history.
A number of well-known racers have been fired, including the bomber Abinaf Pendela, who was the winner of the 2008 Beijing Championship.
He got his fourth name at this o'clock.
The author and specialist Shaha Dde Twit said: "It's a waste of money and opportunity."
However, there are still some bright prospects for winning money on projects such as the golf course, the golf course, the baseball, and the field.
Dipa Kamaka, the independent Indian women's leader, will participate in the match on Sunday, accusing her of her fear-to-be "death jump" for two weeks, and many other activists are trying to do so.
For a country with a population of 1250 million, the low number of prizes in India is always shocking.
The analysts show that there are many reasons for this phenomenon.
Winding India's movement project is a ball, which is not an Olympic project.
India's first jump machine used in the construction and training of the Olympics voters was made of an old motor vehicle.
Parents are traditionally more interested in education than in sports.
And sports management agencies have been plagued by corruption.
In 2012 the Indian Olympics Association elected the leader of the criminal prosecutions against the Covenant, and the International Association suspended its qualifications.
Three Indian voters were not even allowed to compete on behalf of the country with flag and pedagogue.
They can only participate as independent actors.
Airplanes flying from Boston to Sacramento have been injured by the injuries caused by the mutants in South Dakota.
According to a report by the Colombian Broadcasting Company in Sacramento, a plane crash occurred on Thursday night, with 22 passengers and two crew members injured and rushed down.
The 429 flights from Boston to Sacramento at the local time arrived at 7:30 p.m. in Lapid City, South Dakota.
The flight indicated that the injured person was sent to a hospital for inspection.
The airplane indicated that it had provided assistance to the wounded and that an alternative aircraft had moved to Lapid City and loaded the rest of the passengers to Sacramento.
There's no chance that the drug industry has failed to release drugs.
The answer is unfortunate: it's not possible.
This is an opportunity to miss out on the possibility of further delays in the potential treatment required by countless people.
As of today, there is only one source of research-level approved by the Federal Government at the University of Mississippi.
Today there is a message that looks like positive, and the Office has announced that it will now allow other local applications to approve similar practices.
It is hoped that the cancers used for scientific research may be increased in quantity and quality.
While this event will be honored as a success in the field of research, it is particularly symbolic, since no matter how large it is to be used, it does not mean anything if it is still difficult to obtain.
Imagine that a product, although there is a large amount of demand, is still locked behind the door.
As a response to the demand for such products, a person makes an anonymous decision, which is to produce more products but still does not open the door.
It is such a product, and it is designated as a type of controlled substance that is the closed door.
That's the problem with the doctor's cancer.
Given that it belongs to a type of controlled substance (meaning that it is "not currently approved medical purposes and has very high potential for abuse"), it is still necessary to overcome significant obstacles to the opening of this door.
Research personnel who may need to first go to the Office for Drug Abuse, as it needs permission to initiate scientific research.
Even after authorisation has been granted, research institutions must install heavy insurance belts and high safety systems to study a type of controlled substance, which will require a non-fixed cost.
There is also a more objective view that research on a type of controlled substance may be first obtained from your academic institution.
Even if individual teachers want to conduct such studies, the university leadership may not want to cause problems or potential effects arising from negative reports.
This happened at the University of Arizona, where Dr. Su Hessley was recruited after seeking a medical examination.
In April, after the initial preparation of the study project, Greece had to seek private funding for its project, and seven years had passed since its initial development, and her pilot project had been approved by the Agency for the first access to drugs for the purpose of research into the causes of resistance to treatment after the outbreak of the rebirth soldiers.
Then, after a number of years of systemic impediments, the U.S. National Drug Abuse Institute received the last key to unlocking.
It is now the largest federal public fund to fund the research of lead, and is the only supplier of the pipeline itself.
Even if more doctors are now released for research, the body will still have to review any research it has to finance.
However, the problem is the last word in its name: "injury".
In my interview with Donnad Aberlans of the University of Washington, D.C., for the recording, he said that the main responsibility of the Institute was to study potentially harmful substances rather than to study as drugs.
It's in the Aberlans language.
Even if a researcher has been subjected to all of the above-mentioned obstacles, this barrier may not be opened unless the purpose of the study is not to cure the damages of the drug, but to benefit from them.
Consider this: a quick search into the National Medical Library of the United States has shown that there have been 1434 documents on the medical cancer in the past five years.
The results of the search also indicated that only 57 papers related to the benefits of medical cancer.
Most of the papers examine the damage caused by cancer, such as "the transmission of the necrosis of cancer," "the risk of drug use and cancer" and "the risk of cancer".
This imbalance reflects a high-performance picture.
The road to medical research on amphetamines can be seen by surprises and deceptions.
The United States Ministry of Health and Public Services has a wide range of drug-use patents on the use of drugs, as well as in the continuation of the classification of one type of controlled products and the belief that there is no medical interest.
The Bureau continued to be identified with heroin and lead drugs in combination with heroin and lead, although its former executive judge, Francis Xuu, did not admit it.
Under strict medical conditions, many foods that are more safe than our daily consumption are.
For example, eating 10 potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, no more can be eaten on the condition of the human body.
Nature's necrosis is one of the safest therapeutic substances known to mankind.
In order to measure any reasonable analysis, cancer can be used safely in the context of the maintenance of the maintenance of the usual medical care procedure.
Once again, this is the opinion of a judge of his own.
But nearly 30 years ago, there was hardly any change.
Whether we realize it or not, we will accept a certain amount of deception in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the strength to admit it, or we're so unexplained and deaf, so that nobody seems to get any attention.
However, for the hypocrisy of the federal drug drug policy, it is worth encouraging us to tell the truth without letup.
The patient ' s life depends on it, for example, on the treatment of cirrhosis by a doctor, Charlotte Fiji, as well as many other diseases.
There is a plant that can provide so much interest that it is still banned from the doors above, and it is worth discussing.
"Belusconi" is Donnad Tranp.
It's known as an electronic dance.
These musicians show that Tranpe has media leadership advantages like Belusconi.
The founder of the Electronic Dance Group, Leifov, who is a co-founder of blood sugarcane, said to the U.S. online television news network: "I know that Italy once belonged to the state of Belusconi, and for me, Taronp seemed to be a gold-stained Beluscony. "
This candidate of the Communist Party and the political party of the Italian media are known for their individuality, attracting media attention skills and ability to describe stories on the media.
He was famous for his electronic music, as well as for his work as a co-founder and artist, including Sir Paul McKatney, and the composers of the electronic music show, Graity Swaby Biz, in 2013, created a song "The Fall of Love in the Year".
Reef was born in 1977 in Basano, a small town outside the Italian city of Vasano, where he was born about that time, and he had the number " 1977" in his chest.
Rifus, wearing his symbolized black lips, said, "It's not my mother's English, so I don't know what your country is."
I'm trying to find out, and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
It's a record of Belusconi's attempt to control the Italian media by viewing TV politics.
The documentary, said, "How Beluscony got Italy crazy," adds that Taronp had a similar effect on the United States.
He said, "You can see how a man can completely fall and break everything... whatever he wants."
I don't think it's a good thing to Tranpe for this country.
Two Turkish fishermen were arrested in prison for drug trafficking of 50 million pounds [5 billion kg] of drugs.
Two Turkish men were charged with carrying 50 million pounds of cocaine in the North Sea vessels and were sentenced to imprisonment for at least 20 years.
After finding 3 tons of A drugs in Hamar, about 100 miles away from the Abertin Sea, Momin Shahen and Aim Ozman were sentenced to trial in the High Court of Grasco.
It was reported that this toxic operation in 2015 was found to be the largest case in the case of cocaine transport in the sea that has been found in Europe since history.
Momin Sahan and Amin Ozman were arrested for taking part in major drug transactions.
One of the biggest drug trafficking cases in British history is the large number of drugs on board.
The ships used for drug use were on board ships registered in Tanzania, the route from Istanbul to Tenerife, and then to the North Sea, where they were stored in specializedly modified secret ships.
The merchant ship is captured by the Royal Navy HMS Somerset Guard and Border Guard HMC Valiant.
The Supreme Court of Graz condemned 47-year-old Sahuan 22 years of imprisonment and 51-year-old Ozman 20 years of imprisonment.
Judge Rod Kinkrevan told two criminals that the number of drugs "is unlikely to be greater than he said, and that trafficking of drugs affects both the public and society.
The judge said: " You are engaged in the cross-country trade in cocaine by ships, and in fact it is a cross-border trade that has committed a serious business-size crime. "
The judge told Captain Sahan that he "is not at the top of the drug structure" but plays an important role in the crime, while the role of Deputy Captain Ozman "is somewhat small".
The officials of the Hamal-trafficking vessel were informed by the French National Customs Intelligence Agency, which, after crossing the coast of Abedin, found a ship across a hidden boat and found 128 packs of cocaine, weighing 3.2 tons and estimated the value of the street black market at about 50 billion pounds.
The Royal Navy conducted a survey of Hamal's mother ship last year.
There's three tons of cocaine on the ship.
At the time of an attack, the ship was loaded with several heavy A drugs in the tank.
The ship was stopped in the North Sea on its way from Bospurus to South America.
There was a door to a drug-covered space under the deck of one of the crew's bedrooms, which was closed by a water lock.
Sahan and Ozman were convicted of carrying and hiding cocaine on board the ship from 20 February to 23 April last year and from 21 April to 23 April.
After completing their own schooling, the two men continued to operate on the ship and were the first to accept the judgement of the jury but remained firm.
The charges of four other men finally found no justification.
Sahan's lawyer, Jonathan Croess, said that the married and father of two under his neck was a "hospitable son" (a drug-trafficking runner).
He said: " Someone was involved in drug trafficking. "
A man who can command the ship.
As for the level structure of drug trafficking, Mr. Sahan certainly was not at the top of the drug trafficking structure but at the lower level.
The absolute amount of cocaine contained on the ship means that these drugs must be used to transport heavy machinery.
Before these drugs were distributed into these boxes, the police had spent several days checking the ship in detail.
At the hearing of the Tribunal, Shao was informed that in February 2015, he was appointed captain of the Hamal boat.
Mr. Croo said that Sahan felt "so sorry" and "to go back to Turkey" for the important growth phase of the nine-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son.
Since the detention in April 2015, the two men have not seen their families, and their families have fled for approval in order to obtain visas.
Ozman's lawyer, Didi Muhr, said that Ozman's "very eager" to see his family, but clearly this is still a "wishing" in the future that can be anticipated.
In a speech after today's hearing, the representative of the Prosecutor of the Kingdom of Sweden, David Harvey, said: "The international trade in drugs is inexhaustible, and we are working closely to ensure that the benefits are met. "
" In this case, the scope of the search for offenders in Scotland has indeed been covered by global coverage, and in this case we have given a major economic fight against organized crime. "
Every room on this ship is packed with drugs, including the space below the deck.
This package was found in the bathroom of the ship's laundry.
Mr. Havi added: " The Hamal trajectory case was broken by a written notice provided by the French sector concerned and was quickly co-operated by the Chief Prosecutor General of Tanzania, where the ship was registered and was subject to inspection " .
"We got a key ship transport record in Guyana, and then our investigation expanded from Guyana to Spain, where we knew the important information about the ship's stop in the Canary Islands. "
We are also working together with Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific evidence elements.
While reliable information indicates that Hamal is carrying a large number of drugs, the relevant British departments cannot be checked in international waters without the permission of the Government of Tanzania, and the Government of Tanzania has not previously exercised such a mandate.
The Chief of the International Justice and Organized Crime Sector of the Kingdom of the Republic of Sweden stated: " The Prosecutor ' s Criminal Counsel in Tanzania has taken rapid and accurate action to obtain approval from the relevant sector of Tanzania to inspect the ship within 24 hours of receipt of the information. "
In accordance with international law of the sea, England is unable to carry out an inspection of ships bound by foreign flag in international waters unless the country has access to specific legal permits for action.
If it wasn't for our criminal justice consultants to act quickly, the ship would be very likely to escape, and we would not be able to bring them to justice.
Photo by Brian Lomien, a corrupt East speed car.
These are a picture of a abandoned train from Brien Lomien, who lives in Rotterdam, Belgium.
The picture shows the front of the truck, the damaged chair, the window of the locker, and the small machine room.
It's a car trailer that is honored for the East, but it belongs to a national operator in Belgium.
A city explorer photographed these attractive photos, which was one of the best ways to travel.
Their days of hunger have not returned before, and only the cars and cars left behind in the train station have their ashes, and this has become a sight for photographers and explorers.
The 40-year-old photographer Brian Lomein, who lives in Rotterdam, took pictures of these monsters, showing a picture of the naked surface of the abandoned train, the damaged chairs, the windows and the floor and the small machinery room.
The train crew and the car were abandoned in a train station in Belgium and attracted the visitors to the city.
During the period from 1883 to 2009, those vehicles were once a symbol of shame.
This vehicle was used by the Belgian National Railway Company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years of operation on the railway, the last train service to Vienna from Strasbourg in December 2009 with the name of an East-West Car was completed.
The East-East speed vehicle operating between Paris and Istanbul is well-known.
In 1883, when the international railway company began operating on the railway line, it was called "the speedy vehicle in the east".
In 1891 it was known as the Eastern Speed Car, by the 1930s, and began to cover the regular operating services of Europe as a whole.
Don't mix it with a private business van on the east side of Venice.
The number of existing international passenger cars in Hawaii is very low.
This photo shows that the equipment in the small machine room is sinking, the table is not broken, the electric lights are out.
Loman says this machine room seems to be a little closed, and the sound of the car must be very big.
These abandoned cars and trailers have become the scene of deep photographers and explorers.
After visiting these forgotten railways in Belgium, Loméen said to the daily e-mail tour channel: "I can really feel the view of the use of this vehicle throughout the long run."
On the trip, a rich lady with a high hat and a beautiful lady with a pair of shoes.
Astrologer Kathleen Gallove became a "development-contained" Pastor Brass.
Dexas Kathleen Galove, who is a German writer, was deeply impressed by her artistic skills, and comments and images attracted many YouTube fans.
However, her latest role was transformed into a "development-contained" Bust Brass, which seemed rather abstract from anybody's standards.
In a three-minute video broadcast on her "Kiki G" YouTube channel, Ms. Galove was slow and unsatisfied to turn himself into the role of the rogue.
At the end of the video review, she even used some of the music that came out of her own drama and produced a ring and a dark circle.
At the beginning of the video, the genius showed his usual gold medal, the woman's self.
Then, through the artificial extension of the film, she slowly became the "best child of the mother" with the eyebrows, the "Paste Brass" of Tony Hall.
Ms. Gallove made this change through color-colored glasses, the noses and the eyes around the picture, as well as on the face of Bast.
Excellent method: She slowly became the "Past Brass" of Tony Hel's show when she was on the show.
In the process of filming, she also reflected the character and custom of the television role that was set up to follow.
The video shared on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and netizens have praised the technique of this designer:
"You're very clever," wrote a friend of the network under Mrs. Galove.
In the process of filming, she also reflected the character and custom of the hot TV role.
"At the same time as you do these things, I love that way," added another online friend.
Bothelin Gallove has also succeeded in the production of the virus in the role of Roan Svanson in the park and in the caverns.
She said to the followers on YouTube that she hoped that every recent week she would be able to make a paradigm.

Lancao's father was forbidden to attend school because of T-shirts.
A father of two children under the roof was prohibited from entering the school where his child was living on the day of the child's movement with his back in his eyes.
Craig McBeckett, now 36 years old, lives in the town of Chao-Binley, who says he's wearing the "not careful" label "Let's get out there and t*t*t it."
However, although he realized that he had made a mistake, he then turned T-shirts and apologized, and the next day he found himself forbidden to enter school premises.
This single father had been the primary school director for four years in the park in Berlin City, where he was unable to receive his child, and the school staff even called the social services and the police.
Craig Macbeth, a 36-year-old resident of Bernley City, said that he had been prohibited from entering school since the day of his child's engagement.
Mr. McBeckett accused Professor Sarah Mitchell of overreacting.
He said he was being punished unjustly for being so busy watching the two children's game.
The father is now leaving the school director's post, saying, "That's a mistake, I'm forgetting."
When I wore that dress, I didn't think it was a party day.
At the end of the event that day, we held the father's race, and the principal took note of my T-shirt and said it wasn't appropriate.
I'm sorry. I'm going to put that suit on. I think it's over.
However, this 36-year-old father said that he had received an e-mail from the principal of the school that evening, asking him to speak to the principal on the same day, but he felt that it was not necessary at that time because he had apologized.
Mr. McBeckett adds: "The principal called me and said I was prohibited from going to school."
After the event, I found that some parents had made some strange comments on the phenomenon on the faceline, which caused many to be concerned.
It's an excessive reaction to everyone who has intelligence.
As editor of the magazine "Love Mini" on the Internet, Mr. McBeckett said he believed that because of this ban he could not even take his children in the last day of the school.
However, this prompted schools and social services to call.
The T-shirt has a picture of the role of Craig Charles, a role that comes from a self-contained British radio company film "Red Star," which has a symbolic word of the role "Let's go out and t*t it".
He commented: "I told them I couldn't go, because they forbade me to go to school."
Then I got a call from the social service agency asking why I didn't go to my daughter.
The school also called the police because I haven't taken my daughter in 40 minutes.
Mr. Macbeth claimed that he was informed that he was no longer allowed to enter school premises and that the prohibition was always valid before further notice was received.
He said he was also warned that if he was found illegal, he could face a fine of 500 pounds.
This is done by Sarah Mitchell, the principal of the school in the park.
"I can confirm Mr. McBeckett's resignation and no longer the director of this school."
This is over, and I look forward to returning to normal school life in September.
Member of Parliament of the City of Bernley, Joe Connie, said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
He said, "We must all remember that when you play a role such as parliamentarians or school directors, it also means that you must have a higher standard of self-law. Unfortunately, he has failed to meet that standard this time."
Parliamentary Jonathan Nixon added that he didn't think that school would prevent him from entering, and the situation was widened.
Nickson adds: "He's wearing that T-shirt, and he's sorry."
The Lancaughan police confirmed that they received the school's phone but did not attend.
65 percent of Venezuelans want to kill Maduro.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans hope to escape President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seems to be whether they are willing to fight for it.
On the day when the National Electoral Commission announced that this year's "no time " was to be voted for (as a guarantee of the control of the Chevist until 2019), all the people of Galagas seemed to be old and had nothing to do with it.
Third week, a 36-year-old officer at the office in Altamila Square said: "I didn't hear about that news, because I was watching the Olympics and seeing Michael Phillips in the backyard of the prize. "
The Altamila Square in the eastern part of the city of Galagas was the centre of a violent rebellion against the Maduro regime in early 2014.
Now, however, when the opposition party needs more pressure to make a vote this year, not all the peoples of the country show the same zeal.
Djana said: "I wish to vote for citizens, but I will not protest for security. "
Others are more intelligent people who are willing to move in the future, but acknowledge that Venezuelans are not strong enough.
The comments of the Chairman of the Electoral Committee, Tbilisi Lussena, confirmed that the Government was hampering the process of emancipation.
Robert Toreyez, who is 60 years old, told the Fukslatin newspaper: "I will participate only in protests, but I know some of my friends are afraid."
Thus, in addition to many obstacles imposed by the Government to delay citizens ' vote, opposition now faces another challenge: protests to mobilize people on the streets.
Until recently, citizens' voting initiatives have been greatly supported and the number of people who have been mobilized has reached an unprecedented size at the stage of the collection of signatures.
However, when the Government protested to hinder the exercise of this effort, the audience appeared few.
The opposition MP, Sipriano Eredia, said: " Some people focused on food production, while others were afraid of the many arrests and deaths in 2014. "
The next step in the process of citizens voting (i.e. the gathering of more signatures throughout the country) will have to wait until October, when opposition to the socialist Government of the country has declared that President Maduro and his followers are trying to suppress the will of Venezuelans and that it is almost impossible for them to hold a vote this year.
Under the Constitution, if a citizen vote was held in 2017, Maduro might be forced to leave, but he would be allowed to appoint a successor.
However, if he was beaten this year, he would have to make a big election.
In a statement dated 4 p.m., the United States Office referred to the issue and called on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the rights granted to the people of Venezuela are exercised under the Constitution.
The statement stated: " The remaining steps to achieve the President ' s immunity from citizens ' votes need to be clearly and clearly implemented without delay, thereby helping to address the political, economic and social issues in the country of Venezuela as a matter of urgency. "
The political analyst Louis Salamanka, who was a member of the Electoral Commission from 2006 to 2009, stated that no change could take place quickly.
He told the Fuksladin newspaper: "I think there will be no citizens vote this year unless there are a large number of social movements and protests. "
It seems to him that the law is breaking down, but unless the people are strong enough to protest, they may finally achieve their purpose.
The opposition has called for a large meeting on 1 September in Caracas, asking that the process be accelerated so that the vote could be taken this year.
On that day, we hope that people from all over the country will join the city.
"The government will feel pressure," Editia said.
But Salamanka thinks the situation has been beyond expectations for so long.
The expert told the Fukslatin newspaper: " They should respond faster and stronger to the announcement of Lucena, as it actually destroyed the citizens ' vote. "
While some parties within the opposition party recognized that the meeting was urgent, other groups hoped for more time to be organized.
Now the opposition must be careful.
Salamanca said: " If people are forced to breathe, the number of participants to whom they have signed the second round will be at a lower risk " .
The electoral process must be made effective by 20 per cent of the electoral process in the country and by the support of nearly 40 million people.
Salamanca and other analysts believed that even if the exemptions occurred in 2017, Chavestism would suffer.
But some people don't like it.
Our party wants political change this year.
" If the Government closes the electoral process, we will have to explore other legitimate options. "
The United Kingdom's 2016-17 season forecast 19: Sibromvic.
Newspapers forecast section 14 (Note: this is not necessarily the forecast of Alan Smith, but the view of most journalists in the press)
Last season's ranking is 14th.
The rate of the victory of the League Championship (through Oddschecker statistics) is 1,000-1.
The new season, as it were, until last week, the Sibbromwich team seems to have been like this: under the leadership of Tony Plys, who is in the process of running the actual season, the 2016-17 season may also be a comfortable or halting season, depending on the level of caution.
However, as Jeremy Piss sold 88 per cent of the shares of the club he owned to Prices, who was sold to the Lingalas and who were respected for security, which was often thrown into a fast-paced market, the team quickly became the favorite of the botanical company.
The situation in the Black Sea has made remarkable changes not only in the mountain ranges but also in the north-west of Wolfhampton, where new eastern China houses have suddenly removed Kenny Jakit's job.
However, the work of Pryce will not be threatened immediately, and Mr. Reese's care has been eliminated, and this businessman has also declared that he wants to maintain the culture of the club.
Mr. Rei said in his address to the club: "I do not want to change the nature of this club, nor do I want to make an inconsistencies."
I'd like to make a nice house for this club for a long time.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the ranks of the British supercombatants, and on this basis, I hope that the club's rankings are in the front half of the team.
I believe this is the best football match in the world, and I hope that this club will go as far as possible.
According to the record of Pryce, the first aspect should not be a problem.
The next goal is to hit the first half of the ranks, but for the growing dividends of new Eastern houses and the speedy increase in the ranks, it is important to realize that this is also a growing task, as other groups in the middle of the list are also running too fast.
On the basis of the final performance of the 14th round of the previous season's rankings, over half of the teams are certainly more blood-relevant than ever before.
Only the number of footballers in Astonville is smaller than they are, and it is worth noting that during the holiday, the Sibromwich team had an average number of times more than once every 90 minutes of shooting, one of which was the most different games in the stadium.
In the 38th game, they don't have any part in the 13th game, only in the 9th game, they're playing more than one ball.
In the 10 matches they won, they didn't have more than one round, and they won seven times with 1-0.
Not to be overlooked is that in their total 34-pound ball, there are 10-pound-balls in their own place.
Unfortunately, there is often an unsatisfied reaction in the mountain range, and the most noteworthy is that in late January, the Astonville team had a 0-0-year-old bad performance, which seemed even worse in the game.
On the other hand, there are only six previous teams of defense records, but not all other clubs can claim to maintain regular security.
After-protection is often low, especially Johnny Evans, it is alleged that the Asena Club would like to invite him to join after the recent injury crisis.
This foot of the Northern Ireland is well shown in the European football race, without a large rehearsal phone, and the Fascist Bromwich Club will not let go.
Ben Foster's ball show is reliable, they're in the middle place.
Similar to Evans, there is considerable evidence that he was still able to play a higher level of competition at 32 years of age, while Claudia Yakob was underestimated.
It is of concern to all that the future of Sergio Belashino has not yet come to an end.
When the club was run by Piss, the costs of Mark Hus were denied, but the city remained warm, and Mark Huscund was happy to wait patiently.
After the end of the previous season, all relevant approaches should certainly be taken.
This preconceived preconceived, as Plys mentioned many times, has been criticized by all but a little earlier, that is only a relationship that can't get him.
The Sibromwich Club continued to sign up for an alternative player who was under 21 years old in England, but their plan of 15 million invited Díavra Sakogayan was delayed a few days before this transfer. The club said he had passed medical examinations and everything was in line with demand, but he was injured in the back, which meant that he would miss the start of the season.
This has brought much pressure on Venezuelan footballer Solomon Lonton, who has had some beautiful performances in his previous race but needs to be increased on the basis of nine rounds, especially in the case of Riche Lamber's continued poor conditions.
Looking back, the decisions of Victor Anikbe and Stefan Seseni are also inconceivable.
In the course of his career, he was famous for using the efficiency of young footballers, and it was unlikely that during the last race of the 1-1th battle of the Pilgrims (Jonasan Leko, Sam Field and Taylor Roberts), three young athletes who had entered his neighborhood (Jonnasan Leko, Sam Feld and Taylor Roberts).
He'll go back and look for those pilots who've been tested and tested, but he's really interested in Leko.
This 17-year-old attack-type front guard was five times the total of the previous season. He was the first member born in 1999 in the British Youth League.
Matt Phillips, from the football club of the Queen's Park tour team, will be the only new member of the weekend concert.
There is reason to believe that this could be a very busy transition window ending.
When it comes to areas where there is a need for strengthening, Pryce told "The Star of the Star," "I need it everywhere."
Every place you see.
We all need to strengthen it.
The goal is certain, we know what we want.
The facts show that they are more difficult to obtain than they imagine, mainly because there is uncertainty in the transfer process.
The situation of this season can be judged by their performances, and from mid-October they started to flee to Manchester, Lisbon, Totnam and Lester cities in seven areas.
By that time, pressures on Pryce would either be released or become more severe.
And, even if Belashino will probably find a new club, who knows?
The trustees support pension reform, the Tatar-British-British Aid Agreement will be reached.
The trustees of the Tatar-Birth Company's post-retirement pensions indicated that the programme could be regrouped and would not be entered into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), thereby increasing the likelihood of the company's reaching an aid agreement.
The British Iron Penitentiary Pension Plan, which, according to some indicators, measured up to 7 billion pounds of financial deficits, became a serious obstacle to the agreement reached by the TATA and the Tarbett Bridge plant in Wales.
After several meetings with the Minister of Commerce and Pensions, Tata iron is increasingly confident of the future of its British operations. Tata iron companies have 11,000 employees.
The company planned to combine its European operations, including the British company, with the German business group Tischenk.
However, the terms of the aid agreement require the reorganization of the British railway pension plan and the provision of financial support by the Government.
Alan Johnston, President of the Pensioners ' Trust, indicated that if the workers' interests were to be modified, the programme could avoid falling into the Pension Protection Fund.
Although, compared with other programmes, the funding of the programme is sufficient to reduce the deficit to $300 million in some indicators, the Tatar iron and Tisonchberg Group is eager to gain control of the debt.
Johnston stated that the trustee recognized that any buyer of the co-financing company or Tatagon British company was "not real enough for the present and future deficits".
He added that, compared with the inclusion of the Pension Protection Fund, the reform scheme was a more attractive option, as the Pension Fund reduced the treatment of workers.
The source of the information from Tata iron warns that the company is still likely to sell the Tarbert factory.
Since the beginning of the negotiations on the future arrangements of its British company in March, the company has been refusing to provide guarantees for the future of those steel plants, which has been used as an additional price to negotiate with the British Government.
The European company Tata iron company Kushko Chattgi points out that the group of Indian companies wants to make its steel operations "more sustainable".
Chattji, speaking at the annual meeting of the Tatagong Company in India, said that the negotiations on the reorganization of the old-age plan were being made, but he insisted that the plan was sufficient.
According to a report in India, Chadji said: " We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British Government and other relevant stakeholders, such as the Welsh Government. "
One consensus is that pensions have a certain impact on commodity businesses such as steel, so we must seek a structural solution that does not affect business further development.
The pensioner agreed to cooperate in the negotiations on the reorganization of the programme, which would be welcomed by the Tata Bridge.
The changes that the programme may make include how to measure the growth of benefits related to annual turnover through retail price indexes to lower levels of consumption, as well as limiting the minimum level of future growth required by the law for payment of pensions.
Johnston added: " The trustees and his advisers are the Tatars, and the Government and the Pensions Authority have provided powerful evidence that the programme can be paid on an unlimited basis and that it is at a low risk other than the Pension Protection Fund. "
Our investment strategy means that the financial head of the programme does not have the effect of lowering the rate of the recent national debt benefit like many other British pension programmes, and we believe that the programme can, as it is designed, provide for the benefits of self-sustainment.

The head of the secretariat of the China Banking Association of China indicated that asset management has become an important link between the monetary market, the capital market and the entity economy, as well as an important system for ensuring financial security.
As our country's direct financing markets and the rapid development of the rich management markets, the market position of assets is growing.
China's Trusted Sector Development Report (2016) data show that as of the end of 2015, 62.74 per cent of our country's reserve is at the end of 2015, while only 17.11 per cent are at the end of 2011.
Storeby is a proportion of the total reserve of trust assets as a financial institution and is often used to measure the status and role of the trust sector.
It is worth noting that my State asset trust mechanism is not sound at present and that in many areas there is no strict implementation of trust mechanisms, even if it is not incorporated in trust.
P2P network loans, the emergence of risk incidents in areas such as the Private Property Fund, and the lack of asset management mechanisms is an important reason.
The report recommends that all institutions, assets and processes be implemented as soon as possible in order to ensure better financial security and to protect the interests of investors.

The President of the Credentials Service, Mr. Huang, said that, as a risk reserve drawn by the company itself, it would have to pay added tax if it had not been paid. This was a small tax.
" However, if, in consultation with insurance companies, such a product is created by insurance companies, the P2P platform can be purchased for a return on value-added tax and the company's cost will be reduced. "
Huang Zhao has recommended that deep-rooted anti-sex testing be carried out by industry associations in consultation with insurance companies as a pre-examination of the Internet.
The current A market is emerging in new dramas: a total of 3,000 points in one air, and behind that, there are still low flow rates, on the other hand, and foreign exchanges continue to buy A units for 7 months.

The public security authorities conducted a phase of the investigation of the case, the two previous cooperative companies and the manager of one company, the joint developed hotel company, the fourth party to sign "agreements on the issues involved in the case".
At the stage of the implementation of the agreement, the two parties also appealed to the other parties to the Tribunal and requested the confirmation of the "agreement" by the Tribunal.
In the near future, the People ' s Court of the Hillary District of the Nemongo Self-Government decided on the case.
In cooperation with the Central Bank of Central and Central African Republic (Bekin) investment firm, the Central Bank developed a real estate project — the Holenbel Hotel.
After co-financed by the Chinese and Central African Union (Bekin) companies, a former director of the Societies, was appointed by a legitimate representative.
The Central African Union (Betwin), which has agreed to consult with a public security authority after fulfilling the obligations of the present agreement, and no longer follows the legal responsibility of any person concerned.
After a comprehensive agreement has been reached, the Central African Union (Bekin), the Central Bank (Benkin), the Central Lenminist Company, has abandoned the pursuit of Chinese companies, the right of some other responsible persons to criminal responsibility, and the right of civil liability.
This "agreement" signed on 24 April 2014 states that the Quartet has agreed to conclude an agreement with respect to an invasion of some of its staff members and their subordinates and to the return of the amounts used.
The content of the agreement consists mainly of the amount and time to manage a return on funds, the transfer of the shares of the company of the Leningales in the century and the change of legal representatives.
In October 2015, two parties to the Agreement — the Chinese Company and the Council of the other parties to the Agreement — were to be notified to the Tribunal.
The defendants argued that the public security bodies had conducted judicial audits, resulting in some sort of and accounting violations, with the amount of $29 billion being spent.

The accused accused accused the agent of finding out whether the "debt" act was a crime at the request of a legal person.
The preamble to the “agreement” was that it was found that an offence had been committed by a person who had committed an offence in contravention of article 12 of the Criminal Code.
The pursuit of criminal liability and the transfer of the right of an entity is subject to different legal provisions, which are neither mixed nor negotiated, nor are they able to replace the term "immunition", the "agreement" with a legitimate purpose.
The complainant considers that the pursuit of criminal responsibility is the national jurisdiction exercised by national legal bodies, such as the Public Prosecutor ' s Law, and is not bound by private agreements.
The agreement signed by the parties on 24 April 2014 violates the mandatory provisions of national law and violates the social welfare of the public.
Therefore, no legal effect shall be attached to the "responsibility of criminal liability" agreement, regardless of whether it constitutes a crime.
The defendant ' s representative considered that the nature of the “agreement” was in criminal proceedings and that the suspect had obtained a civil understanding with the victim.
The establishment and implementation of the “Agreement” is designed to eliminate the economic losses of the victims so that the suspects can be subjected to light punishment, not to illegal purposes, and not to enforce the mandatory provisions of legal law.
The signing of "agreement" is a statement of the fact that the signatures of the parties are legally valid.
The defendant was considered to belong to a case of a case of a " criminal offence" and a "curse financial offence" which was dismissed by a public security body rather than a reporting officer.
The agreement was merely agreed that, after the completion of some of the agreements, the victim had applied for the removal of the case to the public security authorities and had no conflict with the law of the State in pursuit of the criminal right.
At the same time, the Court considers that the obligation to breach agreements exceeds the scope of the responsibilities of ordinary civil agreements; the effectiveness of the agreement should be reviewed in criminal proceedings.
Following the arrest of police officers, the DPRK rapidly developed emergency disposal projects and set up the Department of Deployment Commands, a clear mandate division, rationalization of work measures, implementation of work responsibilities, and full deployment.

Germany's Federal Immigration and Refugee Agency's latest statistics show that 7 months ago, Germany had totaled 24 million refugees, significantly lower than expected.
In 2015, a large number of refugees from North-East Africa were deported to Germany, with over a million refugees registered in Germany that year.
The German "Economic Week" 11 calls on the head of the Agency to appeal that only 24 million refugees who have entered Germany to date are expected to be less than expected.
Despite the decline in the number of refugees into Germany, the mandate of the Agency remains high, and some 500,000 asylum applications have not yet been processed.
Nevertheless, more and more refugees were brought before the court, some of whom had been waiting for more than two years.
By the end of 2015, the case of the Federal Immigration Service and the Refugee Agency had been reported as "unaccompanied" by 2300.
The central line indicated that the main reason for growth was market reassessment of the expectations of the economy.
The Russian International Reserve includes external reserves, gold reserves, reserves of the International Monetary Fund, and special entitlements.
The Russian International Reserve is co-ordinated by the Russian Government and central banks, primarily for addressing economic risks.
In recent years, international reserves have been reduced because of the decline in international oil prices in the West as a result of the imposition of sanctions against Russia.
In recent years, Goleigh has been the leading point of the film market, which is usually a good, well-producing, star-bubing, advertising the attack coverage, and seems to be everyone discussing and accompanying the film industry.
So, these giants really like what we thought, they came up with a rag, they pulled up a locker, they filled it up?
It is suspected that the cost of the production of the Golleys is increasing annually and far beyond the inflation rate.
According to the data shown in Figure 1, the production of more than $1 billion in coal films took place between 1995 and 2004.
However, the number increased to 197 during the next 11 years from 2005 to 2015.
The increase in the number of high productions means the increase in the proportion of the cost of film production, which also results in the alarming of the industry.
A prominent actor, Spirberg and Lucas, criticized this phenomenon in a forum event, and so on, the industry's "insults".
Of these 29 videos, the total cost of marketing is 40 per cent, and the lowest is 24 per cent.
Physical savings, the production of audio products and the costs of their transport are US$67.8 million per unit.
It is well estimated that the number of obsessives and audio products required, in particular in the adoption of a "resultable" sellable DVD market.
In 2005, the dream industry produced a million-dollar Slick2 DVD, but sales were poor, leading directly to the failure of its current income target.
The 29 film also spends an average of $36.6 million for income-sharing and compensation, mainly for key key entrepreneurs such as directors, producers, drafting and principals.
The income-sharing mechanism can help to reduce pre-term financial pressure; it is also an encouragement to the owners.
Of these 29 films, there is an average of 9 per cent of the revenue for the film, the highest of 18 per cent, and even the loss of the video is about 5 per cent for the share of the revenue.
It is worth noting that the owners will require participation in the income division rather than the profit division.
This is because some of the original large films could also be a disadvantage in the operation of the accounting system of the Golleys.
For example, a report released in 2010 on "Haliport 5" showed that, two years after the film was released, Vana continued to declare her loss of $167 million and made it an empty statement.
Goliath also needed to pay some interest to the audience of various staff, which was averaged at $117.6 million in 29 films.
In addition, the operating costs of the Hollywood Film Company would also be assessed in various films, with an average of $1483 million in this 29 film.
After the removal of the sale tax and imageboard, the party can receive 53 per cent of the North American Stock Exchange and 41 per cent of the International Stock Exchange, with an income of approximately $169 million.
Reimbursement of the average sales costs of $98 million to be issued to the workshop was only about $70 million.
With respect to family audio broadcasts, the 29 film averaged $134.3 million per year.
In addition to the cost of the average sales of $22.9 million and $30.5 million, the net net income was $18.9 million after production, with high levels of income for the relatively high bidder.
The revenue generated for these films was slightly higher than the free channel, with an average of $14.6 million in advance, and $13.3 million in advance.
Of the 29 films, about half of the video broadcast revenue is less than 1 per cent, even after 2011, and only 4.1 per cent.
While building these super-large distribution systems, Goliath still had a relatively conservative attitude to video broadcasts.
In terms of reproductive development, the 29 film produced income of US$115 million by authorising the development of plant products.
But there are almost 2/3 of the top two supernovas, and only 1/3 of the film is worth more than $1 million in this regard.
In addition to the above source of income, these giants also come from airplanes, and the share income of music is not more than $27 million per unit.
It is unfortunate that according to Stephen's statistics, the average profit of the 29-year-old Golley is $14.8 million, with only 3.7 per cent.
Taking into account the long-term income recovery process, this benefit rate is likely to be difficult to overcome inflation.
The cost was the worst in the minimum region ($10.1.25 million), with only one third of the money.
All 3/4 films in the highest-level area (over US$ 2 billion) have benefited.
The core suggestion is that in 2014, Durant and Tuck signed a 10-year contract worth $3.0 million instead of a 7-year-old contract.

On 11 August, it was mediated that Japanese border patrols began visiting the Philippines and held talks with President Dutert to strengthen bilateral cooperation.

According to Japan's "Economic News" website on 11 August, the coastal territory will meet with Dutert and Aza, the Philippines's Foreign Minister, in the southern Philippines, for the first time.
It is the hope of identifying cooperation with the Philippines as early as possible on the question of South Sea issues, rather than the capital city of Dutert.
Following the second day of the meeting of the Asian People ' s Party, held in late July, the two parties agreed to respect the decision of the South Sea Arbitration.
Dutert said to Kry: " At any consultation, arbitration will be the basis for all of the decisions. "
Krie then indicated that $32 million would be provided to the Government of the Philippines, and that it was very likely that the coastal territory would continue to provide assistance in the 11-day talks, and that aid would be provided for the construction of the northern traffic routes in southern Manila.
It is reported that, as a result of its rapid approach to Dutert, the Philippines is moving towards bilateral consultations with China.

At the end of July, when the U.S. State Department visited the Philippines, the public met outside the United States Embassy in the Philippines, asking for "the US Army to leave the Philippines".
China has a poor civilization, and many people have long been in the forefront of the world's development, now becoming the world's second largest economy.
When we say this word, it is not only a matter of too much meaning but also a lot of content.
There is no doubt that cultural self-confidence is based on China's Communist Party, and the people of China are fully cognizant of their own cultural values and strong confidence in their lives.
Many have found that, in a close series of speeches, articles, talks, interviews, ancient Chinese tradition, the traditional expression of self-confidence, has led to a wide range of world-wide controversy.
The fact is that the continued expansion of the cultural influence of China, together with its modern Chinese roots, has been the driving force of China's cultural influence.
China's recent history over 100 years ago tells us that roads, the theory and the system are not culturally unproductive.
We have been increasingly thinking about Western learning materials, systems and cultures, as well as in this process.
After a long search, we found that China's transition to modernization's firm confidence-building is based on the "sympathetic genes" of the people of China.
In a close discussion and examination, the number of the best traditional Chinese culture, including the imagination of the deaf, is limited.

In 2010, China's GDP was officially resident in the Second World, but China was not only economically successful.
Since the mid-eighth century, China has put more emphasis on building socialist culture and is committed to developing a new golden era of cultural development.
Whether the best traditional culture, the culture of revolution or the socialist advance culture, shows unprecedented biological vitality.
Although the cultural origin of China is far from being developed, there is also a very strong developmental movement, it is also unacceptable to deny that its impact and role are far from being achieved.
Although China has experienced a period of loss over the past hundred years, it is now back to the world stage and in a more powerful way. "
During a press interview, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mohammed Hemszek stated that China’s culture has contributed greatly to the world.

If there is a need for withdrawal, staff members can indicate that the train ticket has been withdrawn in order to ensure that they can buy the student's ticket again.
The fact that the university's new birth certificate is only for new births, and others who are living with them do not enjoy the same benefits.

In this regard, Mr. Zhao thanked the civilian police for finding his mother right away, and after making sure that the old man was free, he took the old man home.
According to Mr. Zhao, my mother was over 80 years old this year, Anja, and this afternoon, she told her family to go downstairs, and the family didn't even mind that.
Until 19 o'clock at night, I saw Mother not late to return, so I started looking for my relatives around the house and the islands of the sea.
He also said that the mother would not sit alone in a public car, which was supposed to be carried by a friendly person, and that she was a little old-fashioned, and that she didn't know where she was sitting.
After the engine stopped for a while, it was checked in front of the police, found 11 people sitting in the trunk, and 12 drivers in the engine.
After the driver left the vehicle, the driver repeatedly indicated that the vehicle was useless, and the civilian police had previously found that the vehicle was not useful, and the civilian police had criticized the conduct of the driver and confiscated the engine three rounds.
The civilian police found out that 12 of them were workers in the car, and the driver knew that the car was not moving back to work, that they were very busy on the road, and that if an emergency occurred, they would easily have been killed.

CBC commentators have mistakenly identified Michael Phillips as Ryan Rochett.
A Canadian radiocomer, CBC, had an accident on Thursday night, and he had mixed Michael Phillips with Mr. Rochett.
Eliot Freedman had completely misjudged the two men during the 200-mile swimming race.
As soon as Philippes was attacked, Fredman became Rochett, a long opponent of Philippe's colleague and World Swimming.
Fredman said, "He'll win!"
Ryan Rochette will defeat Michael Phillips in this game!
Phillips can't even go to the front desk.
But the winner was Phillips, and Rochette only got the fourth.
At the moment of Phillips' touching the gold card, CBC's radio went down.
Friedman immediately admitted his mistake.
I'm sorry. I'm messing with the bathroom.
"Get the gold card is Phillips," he said.
After the explosion, the Canadian commentator's devotion spirit was widely praised, and within hours of the competition, he confessed his mistakes again and apologized to the audience on Twitter.
I'm sorry, everybody.
I fucked up.
"No excuse," he wrote.
At the same time, Philippes won a record of 2168 years of success in this area and became the greatest person in the history of the individual project osmosis army.
The former record holder was Leonardos of Rhodes, who was believed to be the greatest winner of the Olympic Games in the game.
In the future, the happiest place in the world will be easier to find parking.
The Disneighbourous Park has published a construction of an expected parking building in the eastern part of the theme park holiday area, a detailed programme for a transport centre and a new person's diaphragm.
The engine is located in the east of the distance area near Highway 5, including a stop building with 6,800 parking spaces and a traffic centre, where park passengers can travel by public transport, by bus, by car and other vehicles at the centre of the road.
On the way to Port-au-Prince, a man will build a bridge, which will be connected to the parking lot and the transport centre.
The station building, as well as the construction of a 14-inch planetary battle site, is part of the $1 billion investment committed to the city of Anaheim to replace the 30-year entertainment tax.
This project, called the East Gate, will begin construction next year.
The parking lot will be built on the parking lot in the Disney Park, and the parking lot will be 1,300 parking lot.
The Centre will be built on the original address of a commercial property purchased in 2014 in the theme park.
The entire project is expected to be in use in 2018.
Ms. Susi Brown, speaker of the Disney Park, said: "The East Gate Engineering is part of our major investment in the city of Anaheim, which will provide more travel stop stations and contribute to the relaxation of the holiday area as we continue to extend the size of the Disney Park holiday area. "
The bombing of the Thailand tourist area killed four people.
Following the adoption of the new constitution supported by the Government of the electorate, a series of bombings were conducted on Thursday and Friday in the south of Thailand, resulting in four deaths and many injuries.
On Thursday night, two explosions were first launched in the Waffle Sea holiday zone, followed by another explosion at five o'clock in the morning.
The town is located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
The police indicated that the first explosion caused the death of a Thai woman, 20 of whom were wounded, 10 of whom were aliens.
The sectors concerned confirmed that there were multiple bombings in the cities of Pugji, as well as in the governor and Vanlen.
Two bombings took place in the town of Peggy, and two other explosions occurred in the tourist area near the city of Peggy.
In the past 24 hours, 11 bomb blasts have occurred in Thailand.
The fifth week of Colonel Quesana Patana Charon of Thailand, the Royal Police Officer of Thailand, said that these explosions were not related to Islamic extremism, but were deliberate acts of local destruction.
He said, "It's too early to come down now."
But we are convinced that these events are not directly related to any type of terrorism, in fact they are deliberate acts of corruption on the ground, and we are trying to find those who are responsible for the incident.
On 12 August 2016 after a small bomb exploded in Washington, U.S.A., investigators collected evidence of the crime scene.
On 12 August, officials indicated that a series of bombings aimed at the important tourism industry in Thailand had resulted in the death of four people, and the sector was working to identify the motivation of the incident and to find the perpetrators.
There is no conflict in Thailand that will lead terrorists to be born on the ground.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he adds.
No organization has yet been declared responsible for the attack, nor have the relevant departments charged any particular group, but these explosions took place in the same week as the Thai voters' vote in the new constitution.
The three southern provinces of Fiji and Zhao-Zaoji are opposed to the referendums supported by the Government of the military, which have been the most anti-fraud activity since 2004 and have resulted in the death of more than 6,500 people.
The day of these explosions was the day of the birth of Queen Luigi of Thailand and the day of the country's public holiday.
Washington is where the Queen's palace is forgotten, and the Prince of Thailand is always there.
King Pimpybon Audde is the world's longest ruler in time.
Ukraine's comment: What is Frakimil Puking doing?
It's hard to judge what these claims really are.
Ukraine denied that the United States and the EU indicated that Russia had provided no evidence.
The digital lab for research (an open-source analytical organization) found some signs indicating that a fire occurred on Saturday, but Moscow's extensive statement was largely unfounded.
Russians have been known for political purposes to distort or misstate the situation, particularly in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This doesn't mean that Russia's claim is false.
Last year, Ukrainian civilian weapons destroyed the power supply station for Crimea, some of which also involved criminal crime and human rights violations.
It is not possible to have an uninterrupted attack in Crimea, although there is hardly any reason to doubt that the Government of Ukraine will support such a claim.
In any event, the image found by the original analyst indicates that, at least from the beginning of the sixth (before the so-called attack), Russia's military presence in Crimea has been on the rise.
These images show the movement of heavy arms delivery forces on the island, including coastal missile protection systems.
It's known as a disturbing Russian upgrade.
A number of reports indicate that the Russian army in Crimea has already planned to undertake a new rotation at the current stage, which helps to explain the activities involved, although it has been the most difficult time since the events of the 2014 invasion.
Regardless of what happened at the end of this week, Mr. Putin's statement on Ukraine has undoubtedly been updated and has chosen to use this introduction (no matter how true it is) for a greater purpose.
The analyst noted that this was a disturbing parallel to the previous military action against Ukraine in Russia.
In February 2014, similar statements and military exercises provided protection for the Crimea volunteer militia on the island, while the Crimea Peninsula remained under control in Ukraine, as a result only of the fact that these militias were the special forces that launched the Russian military occupation.
In August of that year, with the defeat of Russian separatists at the Eastern Ukraine branch, Mr. Putin was on the border with the army, warning that they might need "protect" Russian civilians in Ukraine, he said that those civilians were being attacked.
He planned to enter the area, but NATO claims that this was only to cover the Russian aggression.
What's Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?
Some want to know whether Moscow is likely to engage again in fraud.
The war in eastern Ukraine has been renewed, as was the case before the August 2014 attack.
However, this seemingly similar approach may be a focus in the production of fears of military action, rather than in actual action, which would make Mr. Puking possess a considerable amount of numbers in the boroughs of Ukraine and Western countries.
Professor Mark Galliotti of the University of New York studied Russian affairs and noted that Crimea, as a collective tool for military action against eastern Ukraine, was insignificant and that East Ukraine was not a major part of the Middle East and that it was a better defence for the other regions of the country.
Mr. Galliotti said: "The Russians cannot be really planning a major attack. "
On the contrary, "What we see is a strategy for creating tension in the Russian tradition."
Mr. Putin had been forced to avoid contact with his Western leaders because of Russia and Crimea through the International Peace Conference Mechanism on Ukraine, which has now become increasingly useless.
By taking advantage of the new threats of undisputed conflict, Mr. Putin provided a new reason for the dialogue: to lead him to the impostor.
Speaking about the next peace conference planned early in September, Mr. Galliotti said: " This is a standard Beijing strategy that he wanted to take priority over prior to the conference " .
The only real advantage is, "If I wish, I could make things worse."
It's a position to deal with Western prices.
Mr. Putin also said this week that during the difficult times of the situation in Crimea, negotiations continued to be meaningless and forced others to say that he had returned to the negotiating table, thus putting him at his own centre in such a process.
What does he actually do?
First, it allows Russia to continue to claim it as a world power, even though its enemies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, this has resulted in Moscow ' s claim to have a right of denial of Ukraine ' s sovereignty, which has placed the country under control of Russia at some point.
It also served in Mr. Putin's long-standing desire to conduct a long-standing deal with the United States, in accordance with the chapter, in order to resolve the disputes between the two parties on the issue of Ukraine and Syria and finally the sanctions against Russia in the West.
Since the beginning of the defeat of Russia's enemy, Mr. Putin has reiterated this goal, largely because of the decline in the value of Russian oil and natural gas exports.
Since his last year's involvement in the Syrian problem, he has been invited several times to join the Western Empire as a coalition against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may feel that they need to ensure such a transaction before leaving President Obama in January.
The Russian officials aimed to consider Hilary Clinton a potential successor and to be more hostile to Moscow.
Although Donald Tranp was clearly friendly to Russia, it was still considered unpredictable.
However, Mr. Galliotti said that Mr. Obama was considered a "finding a solution rather than a conflict".
Therefore, a window of opportunity is being closed, and some things need to be done quickly.
At the same time, if no significant transaction has been made, Mr. Putin would be glad to have Russia's weak neighbour imagined what would happen later.
An earlier version of this text was incorrect in the years of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Crimea.
It should actually be 2014 rather than 2013.
The National Assembly can't hold it. The White House is paying off the card.
The Government of Obama stated on Thursday that the Government was disbursing $8 million of funds from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care plans for the development of cardiology vaccines, as such a high standard was not authorized by the State to ratify the new allocations required to deal with the virus.
In a letter from a member of the Conference of States Parties, the Minister of Health and Public Services of the United States, Silvia Matthews Bowl, indicated that, if these funds had not been paid, the United States Institute for Health Studies and Biomedical Research and Development would have spent at the end of the month on funds that would have been allocated to the disease that would have been transmitted to such an epidemic.
In Myanmar, where the incidence of HIV infection is growing locally, vaccine development will be stopped at a critical stage due to lack of funds.
According to the report of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as of last week, 7,350 cases of tuberculosis have occurred in the United States, most of which have occurred in Puerto Rico.
Ms. Bowler said that 15 babies had been born with the first day defects caused by the virus.
This virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born with an infected pregnant woman.
At the end of last month, the disease has been the first cases of land spread on the U.S. continent, and there has been a corresponding increase in the number of political interventions responded by the Federal Government.
Hilary Clinton took part in the campaign on Tuesday in Wingwood, a town near Miami, where a locally-displaced disease has occurred and forced the Congress to interrupt the five-week holiday period in order to take immediate action against the virus.
President Obama and the members of the National Assembly have not shared their views on the problem of Buca virus for most of the time this year.
In February, Mr. Obama requested an emergency allocation of $19 million.
The joint party rejected this request and requested more detailed accounts on the direction of the funding.
For months, parliamentarians have been struggling to pay for the number of assignments and how they should be allocated.
In the past month, the Democratic Party rejected a proposal proposed by the Joint Party, which required an allocation of $11 billion against Iraq, but included provisions prohibiting the provision of condoms related to the virus-related condoms of the Family Planning Association, which could be disseminated through sexual means.
In April, it had resulted in a total of $589 million from the Ebola virus study funding for anti-Baca virus work, which was estimated to be used in the United States by about two thirds of the funds.
On Thursday, Ms. Bowler said that she had used half of that funding, and that by the end of August, it would be over.
Ms. Bowler wrote: " The Government has been forced to choose between temporary delays in delays in the delay of the development of key vaccines and other valuable government projects. "
Democrats have not been able to provide additional funding to combat the BCD with this announcement.
At the press conference, members of the parliament of the state of California, a small group of leaders, Nancy Pelosie, called on President of the House of Representatives, Paul Rehn, to bring the country back on the road to promote such measures.
Ms. Pelosi said: "All possible options are being exhausted, and now we intend to go to the National Health Institute, which is a priority. "
Mr. Ryan's assistant said that the delay of the funds was a long-term step that the Government of Obama had taken, aimed at putting the political advantage of the problem of vaccinating as much as possible from the Buca virus.
The U.S. Institute of Health announced last week that it had begun a double test with 80 human-tested people, and expected a second test in early 2017 in "CAD countries".
However, due to the lack of more funding now, on Thursday, officials indicated that the study had ceased.
Ms. Bowler indicated that she would be allocated $34 million from the National Health Institute for the purpose of studying other diseases (e.g. cancer and diabetes) funds for the study of the vaccine.
Other $4.7 million funding will be allocated to the Office for Higher Research and Development of Biomedical Medicine to support the development of drugs and vaccines in response to public health incidents.
These funds will come from multiple accounts, including $19 million transferred from a plan to provide fuel allowance for low-income families, and $40 million transferred from a plan to respond to drug abuse (e.g. opiates).
Ms. Bowler pointed out that, even so, these additional funds could be dealt with only by the next month, and until then, if the country no longer acted, the research institutions against the vaccine would have to "reduced a lot of critical work".
In the past four months, disease control and prevention centres have spent $6 million to assist countries in providing protection for pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen national preparedness and response plans for vaccines, and $16 million to assist countries in the creation of data collection systems to quickly monitor the complexity of smallpox and other vaccines.
Thailand's leaders considered the attack on the tourism area to be related to the constitutional replacement of the constitution.
The Head of the Thai Government urged the National People to remain patient during the determination of investigators to execute the suicide bombings in the country of Thailand.
The Heads of Government and Prime Minister Baroque, General O'Parson, warned that the perpetrators were "some bad people", and they opposed the new constitution they adopted on Sunday in the national civil vote.
He said in his national speech: "There are still some bad people who have been acting before the citizens vote. "
On Thursday and Friday, the bombings in five provinces killed four people, and dozens of people were injured and attacked, including Peggy and Wah.
The sector indicated that other fire attacks in Thailand also appeared to be related.
The analysts indicated that these bombings did not appear to kill many people but to destroy one of the few economic light points in Thailand.
At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Wads.
The senior researcher for the Human Rights Watch said: " Whatever the motive, these explosions and fire attacks have caused the Government ' s claim that the situation will remain stable after the citizens vote. "
These attacks have created a darker power sector, threatening the public and damaging effects of the economy based on tourism.
Photo of a victim who was injured in a five-week bomb explosion in Thailand.
The police indicated that they did not believe that these bombings were related to international terrorism or to the long-standing Islamic rebellion in southern Thailand.
They described these attacks as "local destruction activities" rather than terrorism.
The times and locations of these attacks have a strong political sign.
The bombings took place in preparation for the fifth anniversary of King George's birth, and in Thailand this day was also considered a Mother's Day.
Four bombs attacked a small town in Washington, D.C., about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the wounded left.
The Constitution prepared by the military will weaken the influence of the political parties and give the military greater power even after the military is handed over by officials.
The Government of the Army has ensured its success through the prevention of the negative movement of opposers.
The International Strategic Research Centre for Southeast Asia, Washington, U.S.A., noted that the killings of Thai soldiers suspected of these attacks were not satisfactory for the vote.
These bombings, he said, were "explainly coordinated but clearly intended to create an atmosphere of terror and anxiety rather than to create large damage and damage".
Last year, one of the bombings in Iran at Bangkok's tourist site resulted in 20 deaths, most of which were Chinese tourists.
The Thai officials retorted the bombing on the ground because of the return of more than a hundred Visslers to China, who had beaten the Visserian armed forces.
General Baroque has been leading a group of soldiers since a political revolution in Thailand since 2014 and has been leading a political revolution in Thailand, he says this week's bombings have made the people of Thailand "infuriated".
He said, "Why is it now that the economy and tourism are moving well when the country's situation is changing?"
We have to ask who's doing this for.
Reactions: What does Simon Mannuel's history look like?
As soon as I got into this game tonight, I wanted to get rid of the burden of the black people I had on my shoulders, and I took it to this place.
But I really wish it disappeared.
I feel unhappy that I can encourage others and wish to promote diversity in sports.
But at the same time, I also wanted to have one day not only Simon, the Black Swimming Movement, but also more black people, because the head of the Black Swimming Movement seemed like I shouldn't have been able to buy a card or to break records.
The fact is, I work hard just like anyone else, and I love this movement, and I want to win like anyone else.
Colombia's fight to protect non-ethnics
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Argh finished his life at a shopping center in Bogo, where he quoted the song "Goodbye Cruel World" on the faceline.
His death was the beginning of a controversial debate on Colombia this week, as efforts to achieve greater rights for the LGBT group were involved in a broader political struggle, leading to a double breakdown of the country ' s views.
After Arig's death, his mother, Alva Reyes, accused school officials and accused them of deliberately putting him out of the group after discovering that her only son had a relationship with a fellow student.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia finally supported her view and called on the national schools to develop a clearer policy on the prevention of discrimination.
This decision is part of a series of legal victories won by the Colombian sexual rights movement, which, earlier this year, has also led to the legalization of the same sex rights movement.
This week, however, they fought for equality, the Minister for Education, and public sex lovers Gina Peoroti became a source of frustration in the course of the decision.
When the content of a pornography magazine began to be broadcast on social media and disseminating the disputation of it as part of the guide manual promulgated by the Ministry of Education, the conflict erupted.
Mrs. Peedy quickly spread that lie.
While the Ministry of Education provides guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender recognition in order to help them pay attention to the decision, there is no need for strict implementation of the standardization rules.
In a fourth-week interview, Ms. Peoretti said: "What we hope is a way of resolving conflicts in schools. "
In a national debate on the future of peace negotiations between the Government and the Armed Forces of the Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, the dispute opened a new line of war.
The political alliance against the Government and the leaders of the heavenly Church have been highly motivated and have been accused of promoting gender movement by President Juan Manuel Santos.
In addition, the Government's recent negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces in Havana had reached an agreement on gender equality and LGBT, which called on the Government to adopt a more inclusive policy.
The Government and peace negotiations were followed by criticism of Colombia's Forum, and 42-year-old Peority was severely beaten.
At the meeting, they presented a report on the rough sea, which some men threatened to attack her and her partner, and the former Minister of Commerce Cecilia Alvarez Corea Glenn committed violence.
In that relatively short week, Ms. Peedi was very brave, and she tried to clarify the misunderstanding and re-establish a constructive debate.
She said, "The reason I keep strong and bright is that I know that there are children out of the cage (public recognition) "
It's a difficult phase, and it's a very lonely time.
She also linked the peace process to the debate on the LGBT student.
She said that as the Colombians continued to have the right to agree with the Revolutionary Armed Forces, this would be a turning point for the country in a terrible world, and they had to consider the causes of the conflict.

To ensure the security of the electoral network -- New York Times
According to a news report published on 4 August, "the United States seeks a way to stop black people from voting on the ballots",
The Minister for Land Security of the United States said that the Government of Obama was discussing additional protection measures for the United States electoral system.
This change may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
The threat of a diverse nature of the network has recently shown that some external role factors (may be national) have shown greater interest in the elections affecting the United States, so the federal Government urgently needs to give additional attention to security security of the national electoral system and to see it as a key component of the United States infrastructure.
Mr. Johnson was not late for communication with thousands of United States authorities to assist in conducting elections and to provide assistance to the Ministry of Land Security, professional knowledge and guidance.
Our voting infrastructure has a variety of different types, which enables security guards to face a tense situation, but it also tells us to start the process as soon as possible.

In the near future, the British Government, in an instant, announced a project that slowed down cooperation with Central Law with the British Michaeli nuclear power station, causing widespread concern outside the sea.
In the past, the speakers of the British Government indicated that the delay in the project did not represent a slowdown in China's enthusiasm, while China continued to cooperate in a wide range of areas, and the United Kingdom would continue to seek to maintain strong relations with China.
The experts noted that China ' s nuclear power was at all levels of technical, safety and operational experience and that costs were relatively low.
Thus, while the "nuclear-power sea" will be tested in a certain period of time, the trends in mutual cooperation will not change under great potential.
It is obvious that the British exhibit on the Chungryong nuclear power station project is difficult to make with this statement.
After the project was built, 7 per cent of the electricity needs of Britain will be met, and 90 million tons of carbon dioxide will be reduced annually during the 60-year run.
The analysts generally believed that the United Kingdom’s own economic risk revealed itself, increased domestic political divisions, increased the frequency of European follow-up procedures, and complex factors such as future uncertainty and increased uncertainty, all of which constituted a barrier to nuclear power projects.
" At present, the prices of British premises have fallen, the funding has begun to flow, and the stability of the domestic economy and market system has become an emergency for the new Government of England.
At the same time, following the adoption of a European referendum, Britain will also face a series of European procedures and re-examine relations with EU countries such as France.
Despite the obvious attitude of the new British Government towards the "distinct distinction" of the previous Government, he said, there was no positive definition of nuclear power projects.
However, for nearly 20 years, the nuclear power development in Britain has been halted, and the majority of the 15 existing nuclear power stations have reached their destination.
According to the United Kingdom's White Paper on Energy, by 2025, only one nuclear power station will be running, at which time the electricity supply will be seriously lacking.
As a result, the public is generally concerned about the project of slowing down in Britain on the welfare of the people.
Sculler believes that China can play a key role in helping the reconstruction of the United Kingdom if it is in harmony with the interests of the two countries.
It is clear that the project will only be implemented successfully and will provide early security, reliable and sustainable energy for Britain.
The private sector indicated that the nuclear power plant project not only helped the people of England to reduce the cost of using electricity but also to drive local economies and lead jobs.
Therefore, if the new Government of England finally decided on the greatest public welfare perspective, the future of the nuclear power project would not be sad.
England can alleviate energy demand, and both parties can find market advantages in the nuclear power sector and benefit more people. "
Despite the uncertainty of the Chungryong nuclear power plant project, China ' s high level of nuclear power technology and expertise are evident.
For example, "Walong One" China, which is going to enter the UK nuclear market, has integrated other advantages in the design and acquired previous experience in the design.
For example, China has designed a two-sided "no-phase heat output" system that allows for the timely release of heat from the heat of the mixture and thus avoids the destruction of the mixture.
It is clear that China ' s development of nuclear power for more than 30 years has maintained good operational performance and safety standards and has been highly assessed by international institutions in the field of nuclear power development and regulation.
The current relationship between the United Kingdom is at an important time in history, and mutual respect and trust are far more valuable.
China hopes that the British Government will continue to support the Chungryong nuclear power plant project, making decisions as soon as possible to ensure that the project is implemented properly.
It appears that there is little time left for the decision to be made by the Co-Chair of the American Economic Strategic Research Centre of the International Trade Association of China, and that the two parties should take the necessary contacts and communication.
" Following the replacement of the President of Argentina, the Central A nuclear power station project has also been suspended temporarily, but has made positive progress, and the current A nuclear power station project has been clearly planned to work in the next quarter of the year. "

Today, there is an urgent increase in the interest of cancers, which may have a significant impact on the incidence of cancer in recent years.
According to the 2012 report on cancer, our country's annual incidence of new cancer cases is about 307,000 and about 211,000 deaths.
Cancer has become the first major cause of death in my country, and the number of deaths is one fourth of the deaths of global cancer.
Cancer is an uncontrollable growth and spread of cells, which can affect almost any part of the human body.
Usually, any part of the body may have long hair, and some parts of the body will be moved to the rest of the body.
Cancer is a genetic disease, but studies have found that only a fraction of cancer is genetic.
Many factors affect the development of cancer, which is most important, and can change.

In addition, some sugars may also have a side effect, such as nausea, pain, nausea, and vomiting when they begin to rub off on sweetened or oranges.
This is because, after breast-feeding, if there is cancer, there may be a reaction to high blood sugar, and a condition of low blood sugar will occur again.
In addition, because of the condition of the human body, it is possible to release multiple enzymes, and in the same case it may also stimulate a lot of blood sugar, and in severe cases it may also cause cancer.
Therefore, the following points should be taken into consideration in addition to the treatment of diabetes.
In the event of sudden drought, diabetes patients must first prevent the removal of water, so they need to drink more water, drink more naturally, and drink more than enough sugar, and benefit from the release of excess sugar.
But don't drink coffee, because coffee will stimulate the growth of the stomach.
In cases where diabetes patients experience a rapid decrease in blood sugar levels, the task must be closely monitored for changes in blood sugar, and it would be best to weigh one sugar every 3 to 4 hours.

According to the previous report, the local time was 11 p.m. and the first bomb exploded and no one was injured.
The second bombing caused the death of one Thai woman, and many foreigners and Thai people were injured.
According to the local police, "three of the wounded were seriously injured, of which seven were foreigners, including four women and three men. "
After the incident, the Thai police disbanded the population and passengers near the explosion site and the injured were sent to the local hospital.
At present, the Thai police are investigating behind the explosion case, as well as what bombs are being used.
Wuya is a famous seaport city located in Bangui, Thailand, which attracts many national and foreign tourists.
The city is located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, in the Royal Palace of Thailand, with a number of beautiful beaches, national parks, historical parks and royal sites.
On 12 August, the World Health Organization indicated that there was no high risk of HIV infection or spread to Brazil in view of the 2016 Rio Games and Carios.
The prevention measures can be taken to avoid two major methods of spread of the virus in the event of movements and travel to Brazil: lead and sexual transmission.
As of 10 August, 66 countries and regions have reported evidence of the spread of the media cadmium virus since 2015.
While some countries or parts of the country reported a decrease in the number of cases of HIV infection, there was no evidence of a decline in the total number of seizures in the country or in some countries, according to the evidence received at the current stage, there was no evidence of a decline in the total number of cases.
The World Health Organization states that although there have been outbreaks of tuberculosis in China, there have been no local transmissions from pigs to humans.
The President of the Philippines, Dutert, on 12 days, said that he had beaten Philipp Goodsburg, the United States Ambassador to the Philippines, but would not apologize to Gothenburg.
The United States Embassy in the Philippines made a statement on 12 days that the United States had taken note of the report on the criticism of Gogödg, which was "unappropriate and unacceptable".
In April this year, during the presidential elections of the Philippines, Godenburg had accused Dutert of continuing his voice and was strongly opposed.
On 12 August Beijing, it was not easy for the Spanish men to defeat Nigeria with 96-87, and they saw the hope of an exit line.
Oguchi took out of the 3rd to 7th rounds, two rounds, three shots all over his life, took 24 minutes, Ako 12 to 5 boards, and Ibekvi 11 to 5 boards.
As a traditional European force, Spain has been forced into difficulties, even from the Panel ' s lines, because of the great lack of Mark-Gassor.
In the face of the weakest opposition of the Group to Nigeria, Spain has also struggled very hard and has been forced to overcome in the latter part of the world.
In the last 1 20 seconds of this section, Nigeria has not been able to share, and one third of Rodriguez's bid, followed by 5 minutes, with 25-11 leaders.
Section II is three and 54 seconds old, and Spain is still headed for 40-27.
During the 6-09 seconds of this section, two of Lulu ' s fines were reimbursed to Spain in 61-48.
After one third of the memory, Augusti has reached 4 points, extending the advantage to 14 points.
However, in the last four-49 seconds of this section, Spain was no longer able to share, and the flowers were opened outside Nigeria, with a round of 13-0 ending this section, with a total of 66-65, which was their first lead.
Nigeria had a third of its lives in the two lives of the attack, and a third of it had been reported as a crime outside the line.
During the three and 49 seconds of the competition, after Amino was hit, Nigeria would be stranded 79-81.
In the third half of Ogochi's life, Nigeria again reduced the gap to 1 minute, and Reyes and Gasol were six minutes on the rifle, with another 15 seconds in the race leading to 89-82.
In the 22nd round of the Beijing Olympics, held on the night of 12 August, Beijing's 1-2 seats were more than doubles.
After a little adjustment on the side of the camp, the problem was not really resolved, because he could not stay or be replaced by a bomb in 76 minutes.
It is more worrying that the owner was unable to move, that he was under arrest, where he was treated for nearly 10 minutes at the site, and then sent directly to the emergency car.
In the words "national foot" twice, the country will be affected by the 12 forces that will come within half a month if it is injured.
This week, in a series of rounds of civil wars in China, he and Paulino were injured by a double blow in a violent attack on the property.
The severity of the injury in the game is more motivating, and it is estimated that it will take four months to recover, i.e. at least to lose at least one half of the 12-year-olds in the race.
If there is even more trouble with the damage to the property, the situation in the country's pre-election will be very much affected.
However, engineers at the University of Berlin, California, have advanced this concept and developed a very small radio transmitter to monitor the health situation in humans.
The researchers described their development in a series of articles published in the "Economics" magazine published on 3 August.
Not only are these transmitters not only needed to use the batteries but can be used to stimulate the nerves and muscles.
This will be possible to provide a way for treatment of non-communicable diseases such as tuberculosis or active human immunization systems.
This instrument has been introduced into the brain and the brain of the mouse, and has been used as a source of energy and read the data collected.
The transmitter has been reduced to one-tenth mm, called "the necrosis", which contains a pressure cell.
The author of the paper explains that the body transforms the radiation from the external body into electricity, using a small cell in the motor, which is directly attached to a neuron or muscle tissue.
The electrical pressure value in the evaporator causes changes in the flow rate and the pulse rate, thus detecting the response of the ultrasound receptor (currently or from the source of supersounds).
Since ultrasound technology is very common in the hospital, and supersede can cross most of the body, it seems like a natural choice.
Michel Maharbiz is a Deputy Professor of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Berlin, California.
As a co-communicator of the paper, he said in a statement, "I believe that the long-term vision of the necrosis is not limited to the brains and brains, but is more widespread. "
The study was conducted jointly by Jose Carmena, a neurologist at the University of Berlin, California, in Maharbiz.
He explained, "It was never possible to use in-body research techniques, since it was impossible to place a super-small object in a deep space.
But now, I can take a very small object, put it into the nerves or organs, destroy the way or the body, and read the data."
In order to test their equipment, Maharbiz and Carmena sent six 540 seconds of ultrasounds every 100 seconds to drive sensors.
But researchers are confident that they will also be effective in the brain and in the brain.
The start of the project was to draw up the next generation of brain exchanges and make it a viable sleep technology. "
"If a sufferer wants to control a computer or a machine, you can put this electrically into your brain, it can keep working there forever."
Two mirror heads work together, separating the visible front view and creating a deeper view.
The earthquake not only destroyed Japan's territory but also shattered the world's digital core industry chain.
Since the outbreak of the earthquake, the collapse of the Sunni Japanese factory has severely damaged the status of the global digital camera as a lack of cargo and price.
The satellites developed were used for almost all cameras without the transmitter, and the cameras were naturally unable to produce.
A recent report shows that Sonny is currently collecting nearly $36 billion in the form of stock and bonds for the development and production of CMOS.
The supply of the transmitter depends on Soni, whether the digital camera or the movement of the smart equipment (unless Soni's technology is completely unimaginable).
Compared to new forms of information, Sonny is more eager to restore the normal transmitter supply, and the current camera price cannot be seen at all.
Mesie will close 100 stores.
The Big Mesie Shop indicated that the company planned to close 100 shops, which was designed to help the binder avoid a potentially serious problem: the company said that in the time of online purchases, the U.S. entity stores had become too numerous.
Mesie per cent regularly adjusts to the chain chain, and often closes ten negative hotels immediately after a year's holiday peak.
However, 15 per cent of the companies in a summer newspaper announced that the flag would be closed. This merger company seems to be taking a more rapid position than many retail shops and collecting stock sizes in order to respond to the rapid change in the real world.
The driver and the buyer were dressed in front of a Messie Lottery shop in New York.
The massive sales show that the plan was closed by 100 stores.
There are many reasons why Messie has made a change: the company's flag has been reintroduced by the growth of electronic commerce in a number of small shopping areas in the region.
Moreover, as the buyers are increasingly inclined to cut down the retailer (e.g. T.J. Maxx) and the fast-paced company (e.g. H & M) buy their clothes, the retail business has become a widespread place of hardship.
These factors add to a number of short-term problems (e.g. the decline in international travel consumption and inconsistencies) that have led to more than a year of difficulties in Messie.
On Thursday, the company indicated that the sales volume of the latest quarter decreased by 2.6 per cent and showed weakness, but improved compared with the previous quarter's poor performance compared with the 6.1 per cent.
The retailer reached a camp income of $558.7 million ($76.4 billion) and fell by 3.9% over the same period of the previous year.
Mesie per cent indicated that these stores could reduce annual sales by about $100 million.
In the past, such a large number of stores may be regarded as a compromise made by retailers because of their failure to operate.
However, the company's stock balance rose by 17 per cent to 17 per cent, indicating that it was viewed by investors as a predicting positive initiative that the Messica cash would have a stronger future.
In some respects, the Messie percentage reduction shop should not be a surprise.
The chief executive of the Messie Bank has already indicated that this bond company is just too many stores.
High-level management has been saying that they are developing a strategy that will focus on some 150 best performance stores and try to resale more sales in those good performance sites.
In a statement to replace Landgren as Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Ginnet, in 2017, indicated that all of these shops planned to close the company had been sold and leased.
Ginnet said: " We recognize that the investment returns at these sites are insufficient, and we often cannot demonstrate the customer's experience of buying the Messie Goods Cards we expect."
The company indicated that it would provide a list of stores to be closed.
Mesie per cent points out that the company is still making final decisions on which shops are closed, so it is not yet possible to determine how many jobs will be reduced.
The retailer will not completely withdraw from any of the currently operating stores, but will seek to close those stores in poor performance locations.
This event may not be good news for the buyers of the shopping centre, and they rely on large leases such as Messie's money to attract and keep other smaller shops operating in the shopping centre.
Have you hidden dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to the new study, for the number of bacteria you will encounter, water from a water bottle that can be refurbished may be "a lot worse than the game of your pets".
EmLab P&K has been commissioned to test 12 water bottles of four different types (including spindles, glazings, clasps and absorbents) on the site.
Each bottle of water is used by one activist for a week and is not cleaned.
The water bottle of your home might be as dirty as dogs.
Treadmill Reviews states: "We have found that re-useable drinking water can store the number of cells that are amazing: more than 300,000 per square micrometer (CFU) units. "
The test has found that the cyclical content of the liquid water bottle is highest and that the average number of units per square micrometer falls is more than 900,000.
The bottle contains a hormonal genome, which can lead to skin infection, lung disease or blood infection.
The following is a glass-pressure water bottle, which consists of 162000 units per square metre, and the cyclists round the water bottle are close to CFU 160,000 per square inch.
The website adds: "These water bottles may be even worse than your pet food."
The results of the testing of the absorbent water bottle are better, with the number of cyclics that are far smaller than other water bottles, with only 25 CFUs per square inch.
This may be due to the transfer of water to the bottom of the vacuum rather than to the deposition of sweetening bacteria in the bottle.
It is described as "normally harmless".
The website says: " Based on the results of the test, we recommend that we select the use of the cover water bottle, because the cyclical flow rate of this water bottle is lower and less than the harmful amount of cyclohexane. "
We also understand that in relation to water bottles and bacteria, non-water bottles are a better choice than plastic bottles.
In addition, there is no water bottle that is dry and difficult to clean up to become the possibility of the owner of the bacterium.
The website recommends that the reader clean the water bottle after each use, which is more ideally used with weak liquids.
Religion must be modernized.
The United States Democratic Party has recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the latest voluntary survey remain unchanged during the elections, the first female president in the United States of America will swear in January.
Last week, on the Atlantic Coast, British Prime Minister Trisa Mejn spoke to German Prime Minister Angra Merclar about the conditions for the withdrawal of Britain from the EU.
Women living in Western society are convinced that they can overcome any career role and succeed through education, goodwill and efforts.
Today, young girls can make some living people who work at the highest levels of leadership as their model.
So has the long-term struggle against women's rights finally ended?
Hilary Clinton was in favour of being elected President of the United States, but the right to women's leadership in the field of religion remained a controversial issue.
Okay, it's not over.
Women's leadership remains a controversial issue in the field of religion.
Last week, the Holy See announced the establishment of a new committee agreement on whether women should be appointed as ministers of the Church of Heaven.
In January 2015, the Church of England appointed Libby Rehn as the first female bishop of the Church, and a similar attempt failed in 2012.
Although the Jewish Reform Movement has been in the process of appointment of women from the beginning of the 20th century (the Jewish Priests), there has been a strong debate in the original Jewish faith about the view of women of the Arab women since the 1980s.
In November 2015, the United States Council of Officials issued a solemn declaration stating that women are illegal in the Arab Republic, which was the third attempt of the Council to combat increasing support for the expansion of righteous women in the Holy See.
Unbelievably, a series of "hearings" was launched by the United States Press for the issue of this controversial issue against a group of leaders of a group of women in a holy position at the appointment of President of the Democratic Party of Hilary Klinton.
Why is there such a gap between the world and the field of religion?
Like the majority of the clergy, the upright Jewish clergy also sought to keep the practice that they considered to be able to maintain stability in traditional values.
This reflects the resistance to pressure to adapt to changing societies.
Those opponents are based on a woman's stand for holiness that does not conform to "traditional".
However, maintaining traditions in this way is not worth the price.
The cost of such loyalty may result in the loss of the traditional community of its life-forming oxygen, resulting in the destruction of its own tradition with the intention of violating it.
In the first World War I military history book, Barbara Tachiman emphasized the traditional risk of the so-called "the tragedy of the red cat".
In the early part of the world war, as the war progressed from a close distance to an even greater distance, soldiers could be given the advantage of hiding as long as possible.
The response of both the British and the German army to this change is that the colour-lighted uniform is changed into a single gray and gray uniform.
However, French soldiers continue to use the same red hats and pants and thus become very prominent targets in the battlefield.
The French Minister of the Army, Adolf Mehimi, made a suggestion that his forces should adopt the same approach, was mocked and opposed.
The red pants represent the glory and reputation of the army, and the military traditionalists do not intend to abandon it.
At a parliamentary hearing, former military minister Eugene delivered a speech to France.
He said, "Do you want to cut the red pants?"
Just think!
Mehimi later wrote: "The blind and stupidly attached to the most obvious colors have attracted the consequences of cruelty."
Religious leaders who oppose women as religious leaders are in similar danger.
They only care about their "traditional practice" instead of asking themselves such a key question: "What changes are needed to keep religion awake?" Their risk is that 50 per cent of the population is away.
They also have the skills and enthusiasm to contribute to the social exclusion of women groups as a whole.
For religious reasons, it may be traditional to force men to continue wearing those pants, but such practices may not be worth it, as shown by the failure of the red pants.
Dina Bottle is the founder of the British Jewish Association of Women's Women's Union, and is also a former member of the Jewish school "Yeshivat Maharat" in New York.
Charton's team has only signed a contract of conduct and agreed not to destroy the club on social media.
While we recognize that everyone has the right to have his own personal opinion, it is not helpful to place sexual sensitivities on social websites.
The club was informed of the fact that it had to obtain a ticket to the former Chief of Police, Cliff Igg, who had joined the club 35 years after the police raid.
The letter then reads: "I need to remind you that the award of a ceremony will be 'conditional' and that you must sign a 'agreement contract', which requires you to remain in control of the future, that you must not place on any social media website any low-sound or incitement speech of the members of this club or of the club or any other form of movement which may be considered to be contrary to the social nature. "
The football team described how he was able to buy tickets for the race and then call the club, but two days later the ticket was missing and received the letter.
Yesterday he went to the club and said: "They told me that my speech on Twitter had been extreme and influenced by others, and I think it was absurd. "
Holiday rides on the Dalmatia Coast
What do you mean, "snake"?
Former U.S. Navy commander Colin said: "I've lost my buttocks." She just finished her journey on a 25-mile journey along the coast of the coast of Croatia, leaving a heavy flow of water and a series of violent waves sent out against the hard mountain.
Some of the drivers sing their own songs of beauty or back-up songs in difficult drums.
Colin's friend Patty suggested singing "The little truck did."
Others have to count the number or the patience of the rounds and think about how they can get into what they call the hive.
Colin lied in various ways.
It's like being chased by Hui Grant in the "four weddings and one funeral".
She and I were assigned to the Dalmatia Coast and the island in northern Croatia for a week, a "Hawa" ride and a bike tour, organized by Freedom Treks.
The summer season was probably not in line with everyone's stalemate, but it was said that North Dalmatia was going to be easier to ride than the south, and we used to sit down, and when we had to complete our schedule with care and confidence months ago, there was a box that only had to be chosen to ensure that we could help a motor vehicle ourselves, but we did not.
It's part of the deal that we're going to stay in the floating house for a week, that's the new spinal cycle.
At the end of the ride, we can leave our car at the gate and collect it from our guide to Ivan and Ivanna. Then we jump from the blue sea, clear seabed, easy to discern seabed, rock rock and other seafarers, which Croatians call the seabed, is the size of a long contiguous rock.
At the end of June, the temperature of this sea is the most ideal, and everyone agrees: clean enough to remember, but does not feel cold.
If there is also a feeling of violence after a heavy morning ride, there is face-to-face, breathing, and a number of winged horses.
However, most of us would like to return to the air carrier's cabin, and the women on the boat would have cleaned our bed and filled up the food in the refrigerator and left a new chocolate box on the table.
Ivan said that it was important to make a promotion campaign after driving himself, and that we practice the promotion movement on our own bed or on the floor floor floor.
The cycle is not the superior super-oil cycle, but the short-term cycle, which is 42 meters long, with 15 passengers and half crews.
In all the fishing vessels and holiday boats on the small island port, she was particularly impressed that we were deeply proud as a member of the ship.
Colin and Patty came from a group of friends from a website called meetup.com from Washington, U.S.A.: they called themselves "the movement and social groups over 45 years of age".
Last year, the shipwrecks of the organization of the Netherlands and their auto holiday activities were successful, so they decided to try more ventures, and now they arrived in Croatia.
A small church that competes with their church is taking part in a tour of Próvans and driving holiday activities, and you come to me on the front line every afternoon to make the air more comfortable.
If we don't have strict control, we'll not have a schedule.
When we launched from the beautiful old Trogyll port near Splet, Ivan announced at the beginning of the meeting: " Breakfast and dinner are scheduled at 8:00. "
The clock on the ship began to show itself, and after the food was finished, the call went out to all to calm down and listen carefully to the following briefing.
"Good moaning" except for the British, I'm afraid everyone has forgotten this nonsense.
In spite of him, it's fun and fun, even though it's coming. Ivanna took out the long-distance plan of that day, and we all pretend to be surrounded by a cloud of mud, and the shadows of the fall and the roads are alarmed, but everything else would be a surprise for Croatia's driving distance from the coast to the coast.
Ivan says, "It's like a heart map."
The straight path is not within the scope of the proposal.
Ivan used English and German in exchange for a brief presentation.
For a few weeks, he has been responding to visitors from several countries, but we are a group of people (Switzerland, Germany, the United States and British) who share two tables of English and one table.
Everyone's been a good friend on the road.
Friendship is enhanced in the race, and the only competitor is geographically, i.e. self-competitive.
It's the deepest, most relaxed group activity I remember.
We'll move the radio to Ivan's bridge soon.
The hard way to climb is to point up a hill and do not mix with the climb path, and it's easier to get up.
The intersection of the path is a path that points to a broken path, and the straight line shows a straight line: simple but not always easy.
The command is always the same: "A team, stay away, it's not a game."
We're meeting at 9:00 a.m.
All right, that's nine o'clock. I forgot you guys on vacation.
We need a lot of water.
We started two days from Trogyl to the North, crossing the Conatial Islands, where we would ride a large path along the Dugi Otok (the "long island" in Croatian) and, after awakening from the course of the natural park of Traska, appreciate the high sandy beaches and the lakes that formed because of the water flow from the underground corridors.
It has been said that swimming in this lake can restore youthful vigor.
If we get in front of the water, will our feet become younger and stronger?
On the small island named Morat, we again fell to the south, where we were scattered between the land and the nearby islands.
Most of our roads are small villages of sandy roads, along the open seas and various fruits: gardens, gardens, vineyards, and lakes; the air is filled with the wind of the Mediterranean, and the vastness of the waves is covered with clouds.
In the past, there was always a little wind, but it was worth it to meet such a place that Ivan would stop the car and rest for the early horsemen.
The movement and social groups organized the activities of many groups on their own on the weekend, which they knew about the customs, which would be repeated on the one hand, and which would leave the road when they were riding so that drivers could be more secure.
When a truck was trying to get over a dead end and hit the emergency car, one horseman said to the other, "You almost hit the car."
Luckily, they're safe.
When it was necessary to ride on the main track, Ivan divided us into three groups, encouraged by Ivana's final teammates, as Ivan said.
When we have to cross the main tracks, we will collect all of them, drive down the road, drive ourselves to a safe area on the other side, and cannot claim ourselves, as instructed.
When we were waiting for the direction to cross the street, a Swiss pilot said, "Do you think Ivan knows he's not sending orders to a group of children?"
And our afternoon light is not always clear.
During the city voyages of Zadar, we visited the Forum of Rome on the back and forth of the sea, and the music that was released was like the waves in the waves of the sea, and music was sent through the channels of open sea water, which were set in the corridors of rock-damaged rock.
It's a good time to appreciate Zadar's famous sunset view when we're done with food. After Christmas, we're back on the beach, and we appreciate the people who made the glass walk with the light of the storm, and it's like the ground's moving.
When the flight number began in the early hours of the summer, Belgrade won, it was as if it were the sound of the sea wind.
The fifth day is a full free ride.
The ship's visit to the Krka River to the sea to see its bloc; the visit of the Hibnik's famous church on the afternoon, which is the work of the Dalmatian people's recovery period; and in the quiet Ziralin, we have been looking for a local heritage pool — we have been having a very interesting day.
Ruld, no matter what the threat is, is ready to welcome the saints.
People gathered to the Holy Land of the Holy Land of the Holy Land of the Holy Land during the first year of the Catholic Church.
As thousands of Catholics gathered in the Holy Land Hall, France's security forces were on high alert, as a series of terrorist attacks were soon under way.
On 15 August it was the day of St. Mary's ascension to heaven, and every year hundreds of thousands of people were present to celebrate the birthday of the Holy Mother's Day at the Mount of Olives.
While this year's Christmas came, the Catholic Church was adversely affected by the death of an elderly priest in France, and on 26 July, two Muslim extremists entered the church in the north of France and cut off his tomb.
Two weeks before Father Jacob Hammer's murder occurred, a Tunisian (inquiry who was said to be an extremist over the influence of the Islamic Holy War videos on the Internet) in the city of Niss in the seaport city of France, killed 85 people.
Three large attacks took place within 18 months, and many French people are now concerned about attending public meetings.
The number of arrivals in France has fallen, and the sector concerned has been concerned about the decline in the number of visitors to Christmas this year.
However, concerns about the elimination of Caesar were not true, and some organizers indicated that there was even a significant increase in the number of people at the next moment.
It is expected that some 25,000 believers, including groups from Italy and Belgium, as well as some 200 members of the Christian sectarian delegation, will be present.
Many of the Saints say they will not be intimidated.
66-year-old Christian said to the French newsmagazine: "We won't stop living." He said that praying in front of the riot was "the only weapon."
As one of the coordinators, Mattie Giniel said: " It is important to show that life continues. "
We can't give up our beliefs, our faith and our way of life because some fanatics try to spread fear.
Since the start of the Nazi attack, France has abolished a number of major activities, including the large mining markets in the northern city of Rill, as well as the European road self-propelled railway race, originally held in Nice in September.
The priest, Fabian Leigh, who was responsible for official Christmas activities, said at the end of the week: " In the past week, I was concerned about getting a call to cancel the event. "
However, he pointed out that the attacks seemed to have moved believers, and the number of people predicted was increasing at the latest.
Cristian Grace, head of the local hotel trade union, confirmed that some signs show participation in the "willing growth" of the Holy Kingdom after an attack took place.
In 1858, St. Mary, who had been in the cave of the Holy Land, was greatly strengthened by the healing of the Holy temple, was revealed to the poor shepherd girl Benadet Soberu.
In order to protect the region, approximately 250 police and ten soldiers have been deployed (including bomb disposal experts and search dogs).
The series of morning-to-day saints in the area of the security area needed to be searched through a search post, where the first 10 roads were reduced to three.
Earlier this month, Catherine Simcox, who traveled from northeastern England to Ruled, described the situation of strengthening security.
She told the local news: "At 4:00 a.m., some armed guards were deployed in the Holy Land, and then the door (use of metal roads) was set up as only a series of entries to search for packages during the entrance."
She said, "It makes my three children very nervous, they know well about Lurde, when they ask why they are so careful about the forest, it's hard not to be afraid of them."
It didn't hurt my experience, but it made me feel really necessary to do so, and I understand that these measures are comforting to some.
The open path of Friday's journey was also reduced, since it was once in the city of Lurde, and now the starting point and the end point were in the Holy Mother's House.
Other measures include the closure of the airport ban on the city of Ruld, the closure of the road around the Holy Land, and the replacement of garbage with transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Kazinaf, will conduct a security inspection on Saturday.
Ruld, one of the world's largest heavenly religions, attracted some 60 million people each year to the Holy Land.
Many visitors also brought sick or disabled relatives to tell Benadette that they had found water gushing in the cave of St. Mary and believed that there was a cure for the water.
As one of the organizers, Thierry Castillo believes that this year's meeting "is somewhat unusual, because fear seems to be rooted in France".
However, he confidently said, "This will not affect the quality and depth of the holy trial. "
Fifty-five-year-old volunteer Frances is helping the sick, and she admits that there's a lot of armed soldiers in the scene.
But it's only good if you let everyone rest.
Two people were injured in the shooting incident at the Saragosa Shopping Centre.
A man shot at a shopping center in Saragosa, a city in the northeastern city of Spain, and injured two people.
The event took place at 11 a.m. in the city of Saragosa.
According to the initial report, the shooter may attack one of the women, who is believed to be his former partner.
The shooters fled after the murder, and now the police are chasing.
Turkey's diplomatic officer who has been looking for a non-political change.
Turkey was seeking a political change on 15 July when at least 32 diplomatic officers were unable to return to Turkey.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Chaušolu, said on Friday, 208 Turkish Foreign Minister staff were summoned from all over the world to Ankara, where 32 "unauthorized" were unknown.
In Turkey, there are about 18,000 civil servants, who have been arrested or suspended by military leaders and students, whom the Government considers to be loyal to the French F.G. in the United States, and accused of planning this rebellion against the Government.
Glenn, who lives in the United States of America, is a Turkish citizen.
Chuvasholu stated that a working group of the United States Ministry of Justice would visit Turkey later this month to discuss the possibility of extradition of Greenland.
This issue has become a barrier in the bilateral relationship between the United States and Turkey (member States of the NATO Organization).
The United States opposed the policy adopted by President Rejep Taip Eldoan after political changes, and Turkey ' s response was to try to develop a closer relationship with Russia.

Osport's organizers are trying to clean up the green water tank.
On Friday, the Ossetians who were trained in the Ossetians found that the pool was closed when they arrived because the Ossetians had spent more time cleaning the green pools so that they could prepare for the upcoming first private race project in Rio.
When two water projects were held on Tuesday, water was suddenly changed.
The organizers continue to claim that the water is safe after the larger pool used by their neighbours for swimming pools and flowers.
When the protesters arrived in preparation for a hot morning movement, the water pumps were closed, although the local time was resumed at 1 p.m., and only two and a half hours from the women's 3 m in-flight water race began.
The color of the pool looks close to normal, but there's still a bit green.
Aby Johnston, a U.S. diver who participated in the jumping project, said she was informed that the jumper had been closed and no notice had been given.
She writes on Twitter: "#FixTheSwamp" should start the trend forecast.
In Twitter, British activist Tom Dili, who won the water race, also commented on the status of the swimming pool.
I hope that means we won't swim in too bad water in the next few days!
Mario Andrada, the principal speaker of the Local Sports Organization Committee, stressed that water is safe for the race and that no problem was raised with 3-mile advance.
He acknowledged that some activists were concerned about the water but indicated that it was because of the clean work on the water basin.
He said, "We have reaffirmed the fact that this pool will not pose any threat to the health of the activist."
On the day when the floods occurred, two protesters complained that they felt that they were blind.
This is because the first reaction when we see the water becomes green is to use chemical chloride, which is very common in the fluid.
We've reduced our consumption immediately.
We re-examined the water, and the results show that the indicators are entirely within the range of parameters.
Simon Langford, the lead speaker of the Marielank Navigation Centre, said that the closure of the watershed was to carry out additional cleaning operations.
He said that this decision had been supported by the International Swimming Union.
In a statement, Rand said: "The closure of the water tank is the reason the water tank needs to be stopped so that the water tank can be restored to its blue state as soon as possible."
Andrada stated that the situation of water pollution was not preventable by the organizers.
He said, "Chemical isn't a precise science. "
As we all have seen, things need more time than expected.
The rain in the past few days has even made it even harder to restore normal work.
Andlada said: " The rain was not helping to improve the situation. "
He added that the activist could perform ground training in the morning, but he admitted that such an arrangement "is not an ideal one."
He explained that the water changes were due to an increase in levels of lead, and that water in the water chambers might be similar to green when there was no proper monitoring.
The best chemical substance has been discussed when we are going to address the problem of greenhouse gases.
Andlada said: "Motors are training in the pool, so we cannot use too many chemicals in water. "
Of course, we should do better at first to prevent the water from becoming green.
When the water turned green, we made another mistake.
