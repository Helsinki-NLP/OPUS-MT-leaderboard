Speaking in English?
I sent you a bill.
Everybody okay?
Everything okay?
Everything there?
I'm leaving school.
I share his political ideas.
Is he interested in me or something?
Is he really coming?
Is his father a doctor?
I've got it.
I have to come too.
I have to run.
I shouldn't have said that.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
I shouldn't have asked Tom's verdict.
I should've stayed longer.
I kept my mouth shut.
I'm Sara.
It's five o'clock!
Does it have any value?
Is that serious?
Is that true?
Is that far?
Is it far from here?
Hard to learn Greek?
Could I even have a chance with Tam?
Can we get there on the way?
Is it raining?
Is that red?
Is it safe to drink who's the brake here?

Is that right?
I missed one line in the book.
I slept yesterday all day, because it was the first day.
I slept late.
My dress is straight?
I'm getting nervous all the time.
I'm tired.
Isn't that an area?
Isn't life wonderful?
Isn't that theirs?

Not yet in my decision.
You're still missing me.
I'm still sure you'll win.
I still think you're hiding something.
A cold shower?
Do you think you're acting like a bitch?
A war scene?
You hungry?
Is that what you're talking about?
Suscurrant?
You're full?
I've learned very hard.
I suggest you send him a thank-you letter.
I suggest you put the gun down.
I guess I'll have to be more careful in the future.

It turned out to be more.
It bothers me.
It could be catalytic.
It's the future of being a hero.
He can't be busy.
It can get anywhere.
It could happen.
It scares me to be honest.
It's definitely a good feeling.
It depends how you deal with it.
Depends on the connection.

It didn't matter to me.
It didn't even make me think.
It didn't go that far.
It won't be more than three minutes.
It took some time to get rid of it.

It happened today.
Turns out it's true.
We'll be much warmer.
It's going to rain more than three hours.
It's been raining since the first day.

No face and no way is easy to want everyone.
It's been changed.
It's stupid, but on the other hand it's not good.
Clearly what to do.
It's a shame you're going.
That's so much he's going to America.
I doubt if he made his own homework.
It's stupid to wonder what you can't move.
Out of the way now.
It's hard for me to leave.
It's hard to say what a nicer car is.
It's important to help it.

It's too good to be true.
I'm sorry, that's right.
Arguing with him is a joke.
The feeling is that it's the right thing to do.
That doesn't make sense.
It doesn't do anything.
It just looks stupid.
He's alive in the spring.
It'll be good for everyone.

Maybe it's true.
It might help to look at the problem from a different perspective.
Maybe it's not your nature, but at least you'll be a little nicer.
It may not be necessary for you to do this, but I think you need it.
Could be raining tonight.
It could look weird.

It's a heavy mission.
It's a personal favor.
It's magic!
It's a great secret to release under.
It's true we're hurt, but the surveillance in the movie has renewed my fear of the danger ahead of them.
It's a breath of prayer.
It's a quote from a book.
It's a joke.
I used to thank you for that.

That's a word I'd like to find a change.
It's not boring to hear voices when you eat Mark.

It's just like fighting for spiritual security.
It's like giving Dracula responsibility for the blood bank.
Today looks like a test of strength.
It's time for lunch.
It's a good smell!
I don't want to share it with anyone!
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
It's morning.
It's my duty to help you.

It's on his last leg.
It's just a guess.
It's on my payroll list.
In a short time, the rain began to fall.
