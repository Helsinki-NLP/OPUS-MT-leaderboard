Members of the Gales National Assembly received "pass by Mars"
There is a misunderstanding by some Members of the Gales Parliament (AM) on the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Members of the Gales Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plan to change the name of the assembly for the Galés Parliament.
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political colors, felt that this would make them fall in the mud.
A working AM said the group is concerned about "the appointment to stay with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Galese readers: in the Galesa language, "twp" means "idiota" and pwp means "excreements".
A Plaid's AM stated that the group in its globality "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A French conservative said that the group was "open" with regard to the change in the name, but pointed out that the MWP designation was probably very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Gales has a statement similar to the letter from Yorkshire or non-English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drawing up legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on how the Members of the House are appointed will be obviously taken by themselves."
The Law of the Government of the Wales State of Wales of 2017 gave its Assembly powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which provided general support for the proposal to designate the Assembly by the Galès Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favoured "Members of the Galès Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favourable in public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring the consensus together can be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as the rules on non-qualification of AMs and the setting up of the system of committees.
When they debate legislation, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonia will refer to the change in the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change in their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with the neighbor Greece, which incorporated a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has insisted very much that the name of its neighbour to the north is a complaint about its territory, and has repeatedly raised objections to its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposition from the Plebiscito on change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the amendment of the name is no more than the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
Sinos of St. Martin wakes up at a time when the churches of Harlem struggle for survival
"In a historical perspective, the old people I talked to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is no one or no other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"The bars ceased to be the rooms of the neighborhood where people run regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, worry about the possibility of money gain with the sale of patrimony does not last as long as the leaders wait" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the point of departure."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by a preview of apartments with condominiums inhabited by people who will not support the remains of the village shrines.
"The bulk of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and, therefore, will appreciate the arrival of the day when these churches will all be closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will meet with these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation came out of here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then forced by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate areas.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverdo John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the laymen of 125th Street, an important commercial street in Harlem that opposed the recruitment and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for their reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carilion.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the "the sons of the poor."
The specialist who touched the carilion in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and "an insubstantiable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the world's first career to be played by a black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who changed to the largest career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's last few months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the leading body of the parish consisting of Latin leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "proceeding to reimburse the costs" was not involved in the contracting of the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubarão causes injuries in a 13-year-old adolescent in a dog-to-a-lago in California
A gunman attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a hunting trip to the lake in California, on the first day of the fishing season, the authorities said.
The attack took place shortly after the 7th morning near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been dating friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy cry for help, then moved in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for having caught a fish, but then it became evident that the boy cried "I was killed!"!
I was murdered!
The entire keyboard area was relaxed, Hammel described what he noticed when he arrived at the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, "There's a tube in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The type of tuberculosis responsible for the attack is unknown.
The surviving Captain Larry Giles stated in a communication to the press that a tube had been warned in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not considered to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the throne.
The authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of tuberculosis in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sansbury's plan to enter the UK cosmetic market
Sansbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to win quota on the UK cosmetic market, estimated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothes and articles for the area are coming up, these larger cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores scattered by the country and will be implemented in more stores in the coming year if their success is demonstrated.
This cosmetic investment results from the search by supermarkets for ways to use another display space used for TVs, micro-waves and articles for rent.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would double its catalogue of beauty products with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to stores like those of Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaxing its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products obey vegan prices, something more required by the younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume store The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Saninsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, will be opened near the end of the year.
Online purchases and changing food purchase habits for small quantities daily in nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to work more to convince customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that stores are becoming more and more like large warehouses, at a time when the supermarkets try to fight Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
The Sainsbury's has come to install sales points Argos in hundreds of stores, has also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this strengthened sales of merchandise products and made the most profitable purchases.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sansbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference in the distribution of revenues from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Sainsbury's has sold its pharmaceutical business for three years with 281 sales points to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Saninsbury's business, said: "We have transformed the aspect and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, which will be available to advise the customer.
Our brand range was designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistibility point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones "freak" after Holly Willoughby has left business of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, a star from Dragons Den, became "frequency" after the TV presenter Holly Willoughby had left a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to concentrate on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles for the house and accessories Truly.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The representative of This Morning, 37 years old, announced on the Instagram that he would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones alive by leaving the lucrative brand in the last minute to concentrate on their new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became "frequency" when the gold girl on TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Wednesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which value might rise to 1.5 million pounds) involved leaving time to devote to her brand of rent and accessories Truly.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in the Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones had caught a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was far more than Holly's priorities.
It would mean the long-term resolution of its future and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave left all completely frightened.
No one believed what was happening on Wednesday... was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of articles ready to sell at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation, which is among the most lucrative videos in Great Britain, will cost millions to the company, given the advanced investment in products, that go from carpets and watch clothes and articles for rent, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Families make holidays together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador to the M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative of the I'm A Celebrity of the ITV program.
A nearby source of Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on their business".
A hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The North American President pointed out in a funny way the criticisms of the media for making a comment that some would consider "no president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump pay so much?
Trump said, in his voice, "Telepaper Pivot."
"I didn't give up on anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, highlighting that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are moving forward.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the most important North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see a "responsibility" of the US to the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were ready to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship led to positive results: the end of the fire tests, support for the release of hostages and return to the country of the dead remains of American soldiers.
In addition, he defended his involving approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be honored by a president, but instead of being 10,000 people out there trying to get into this superlayed arena, we'd have about 200 people on foot right here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause destruction on an island, causing hundreds of people to die
For example, the earthquake in Lombok, for example, told foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, there was no national disaster, a pre-requisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, it has been clear in many cases that they are not seeking international assistance; therefore, it is becoming a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children are organizing a team that will lead the Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, Vice-President of the National Disaster Response Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies could contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains extremely ill prepared for the heat of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not easily warned in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palu, because of the presence of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will last for at least three days to reach the place of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who did the improvement of the infrastructure depreciated a central part of his electoral campaign, spent enormous amounts of roads and roads.
However, the lack of funding has led to the execution of Mr Joko, at a time when he faces his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also under pressure from persistent sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were released while Christian bands and Muslims fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other handguns.
See: Daniel Sturridge do Liverpool makes a long finish for the roof against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, with a bullet in the 89th minute of the Saturday, at Stamford Bridge Stadium, in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's ball, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a finish towards the second step.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the big area by heading to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell on an Arrizabalaga flight and fell into the network.
"It was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq advance as much as possible, so he was just winning the maximum possible time," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Kante coming, I gave a touch, and I didn't think too much about it, I just finished."
Chelsea won for 1-0 at the interval after marking a goal in the 25th minute, from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advance of the blues gave a step back to Matthew Kovacic before demarcation near the middle-field and perform a sprint towards Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick move to the middle camp.
Then he made a fine finish that went through the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
This crossed the defenses and made the goose against the second traves with a finish with the left foot that passed by the Alison Becker guard of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the phase of the League of Campings on the three afternoon afternoons at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European Union on Wednesday afternoon in London.
Number of deaths in Tsunami in Indonesia up to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, declaring the country's disaster response agency on Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the destructions of buildings that were depleted during the quake of magnitude 7.5 on the sixth-party, which set out waves reaching the 6-metre height, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, the agency's spokesman, at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of the buildings they destroyed.

Parliament's Cromwell statue became the most recent monument in the content of the "historical reviewism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice by its destruction, which reminds of the perpetrate by the Taliban, of so many cultural and religious artifacts in English, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a joke" and "a attempt to rewrite History".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell next to the Westminster Palace would become a target to fall.
The icononclastia of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his past Thomas in the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliament defender against external pressures, in his case, of course, of monarchy.
If this is the case, or not a very precise description is the subject of a historical debate that goes on.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of this division.
Their successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of respect and celebration."
Murderer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his appellant "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and blood-covered artery, near a pool on the market in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, was read in South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The suinicultor is prepared to inject porcine vaccines into a suiniculture on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he will have traveled with the first from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door for a quiet neighbor.
In that quiet, he said, he was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
A federal analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 kilograms, had attacked the suinculator until death, according to the report.
"My first legs were covered with blood and spasms, said the first, referred to by his appeal "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Friday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan nor to his firstborn.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks have already been reported.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilous pig mobilized a Gale farmer against its tractor until the woman was able to scare the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba declared to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulation".
"They're just playing.
They like to kiss, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the due respect," he said.
Restoration of the Rosa prison should bring strong generalised rain to the south-west of the United States
As planned, the Rosa hole is weakening when it moves over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the whole north and south of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., East hour on Sunday, Rosa caused noises of 137 km/h, a category 1, which is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to form a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of the Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the southern part of the United States.
On Tuesday, it will cause precipitation which may reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At this point, tropical humidity to interact with the depression near will produce strong globalised rain in the south in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, droughts and, possibly, landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5-7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation will occur in Southeast areas, especially on much of Arizona.
There are possible repeated floods with conditions in rapid degradation, due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It is highly unusual to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
The strong precipitation can make the desfiladers turn into good rivers and the founds turn into strong dot winds and dust clouds.
The near depression will result in strong precipitation of parts of the southern coastal line of California.
There are possible total precipitations of more than 12 mm, which may cause small convulsions of debris and scoring roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the cold station in the region.
A few tropical waterways will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of the afternoon, before rain becomes more widespread at the end of the afternoon and on the third.
The rain will spread in Four Corners on the third of the morning and will lose to the fourth.
The month of October may record strong changes in temperature throughout the US territory as the Arctic recovers, however, the tropical areas will remain quite a threat.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic differences in temperature throughout the central area of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is expected that most of the central and eastern regions of the United States will register a warm beginning in October, with temperatures generalised between 27 and 30 degrees from the South to the northeast.
New York City can reach 27 degrees on Wednesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of the incidence of temperatures above the average in the eastern part of the USA until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people attended last night at six television stations to the witness raptor of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and of the woman who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued with the stations to interrupt the regular programming due to a recent turn of time: an agreement drawn up by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct a week's investigation on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had thrown her away while she was pregnant and tried to throw her away at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a flashed witness, said he has absolute certainty that this has not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, number confirmed by Nielsen on Saturday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of players in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscares ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose rapporteurs gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC remained second with 3.26 million players.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen refers to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the sixth-party drama.
After the moderate Republican office had issued a statement stating that its vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the CNN and CBS cameras in the morning to be verbally attacked by demonstrators when he tried to enter a lift to address a hearing by the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained invisible to the floor as he was criticised directly for CNN cameras.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
It was said to him that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the lift door had closed, that he would have more to say in the hearing of the committee.
The cable and radio stations were all covering the event directly hours later, when the Judicial Commission was voting to make the appointment of Kavanaugh to continue for a vote at a plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so in the sense that the FBI would investigate the charges against him for the next week, which the democratic minority had come to demand.
Blake was partly convinced after conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI on allegations against Kavanaugh.
First Minister May accuses critics of "political making" with Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused the critics of his plans to leave the European Union 'political' with the future of Great Britain and to undermine national interest, in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper's first page, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as "Checkers Plan" by the Minister for Brexit, stating that a proposal that foresees that Britain and the EU cover the prices of the other party is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Homicide: Police stop Dyteon Simpson's suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police hold a suspect of Sims' death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with murder in the second grade, according to a communication from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video from the comparison between Sims and Simpson, having the police stated that Sims lost his eyes during the struggle.
The police recovered them at the scene and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA, news to WAFB, a CBS branch.
After asking Simpson, the police mentioned that this man had killed Wade with a gun.
A $350,000 loan was established, said the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge's medical office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head that spread to the neck.
The department refers to the collaboration of the action group of the State Police of Louisiana, the state police lab, the Southern University police and the residents of the area who cooperated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligency and effort to obtain justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced man, with a height of 1,98 m, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game in the last season.
On the sixth morning of the morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "damaged" and "cocked" by the death of Wade.
"This is what worries us forever," said Wade.
Vulcano removes ashes in Mexico City
The popocatepetl volcano’s emulsifiers reached the villages south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised the Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a recurrence of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and lead in a 24-hour space.
The center detected a number of deaf and trembling noises.
Images on the social networks showed fine snow beds covering car brakes in the streets of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located at 72 kilometres of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake devastated the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Controversy between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote by independence
Six people were held in Barcelona on Saturday after confrontations between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polariser referring to the catalan over the secession.
A group of masked separatists, worked by the intervention police, reached it with eggs and launched tinta in powder, creating dark dust clouds in streets that are normally filled with tourists.
There were also later confrontations, in which the police used the boutiques to contain conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced Unionists who shouted "Long life for Spain".
Forty people received treatment of minor injuries suffered in protests, which can be read in local press.
The tensions remain high in the region focused on independence, one year after the reference of 1 October that was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters carefully chose independence, although the influence on the Urns had been low, with a majority of those against them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the vote in the current rounds of votes cast by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups had been camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although this event has been carried out, it has been forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalunha would become independent.
"Last year, we live our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy that they could vote, but now we're locked up," he said.
Despite having gained a vital but tangential victory in the last December regional elections, the independent Catalan parties have had difficulties in maintaining this year's impiety, with their most known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention to wait for judgment for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since last year, announced that they would apply to the European Parliament in the elections of the next year.
"To present me as a candidate to the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression to which we are assisted by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving a car against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly attacked in a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Friday at 19 a.m., a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot an animal against the car.
Menga attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goo for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, amazed the Rangers and gave Steven Gerarrd the second defeat of only two in 18 games as the technique of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed from level to Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team, which continues without a home win in the first division, faces Hearts leaders, with more than eight points, on the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will meet at home the Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Friday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its six games to its success without defeats in the division, with the main Holt trainer without losing one time since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against entombed visitors
Holt's team should have advanced in the marker much before the goose, because the incisive character of his game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson entered the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the ball and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his effort long after he had failed to find Craig Halkett's head on the ball.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in ball games stopped.
And it was this way that the crucible came up.
The Rangers granted a book and Livingston received an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to take the trip to Menga, which gave a touch and marked from the center of the big area.
At this point, Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the house's impenetrable team, and Liam Kelly's guards had no major problems.
This pattern continued on the second part, although Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the Rangers guard's legs, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a long-distance touch from another Liverston football game.
Crossings continued to come to the large area of Livingston, which were subsequently resolved, and two claims of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on Glenn Middleton's replacement and the other after one hand, were rejected by the arbitor.
Livingston Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, and Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this ascending trajectory.
Their game style and staff have changed little since their return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt in the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, gaining an extremely well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their maximum throughout the game.
Whatever the case, Rangers showed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated at times with Gerard, the team was very close to these standards.
Their final game was little inspired (only once they were able to open the home team), forming a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received environmentally in Colonia
There were tears under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, whose aim is to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Colonia to open up a new and giant mix.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked the presence of their president immediately.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Antagonical protests reflect the divisionist character of a guest called a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of the Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a street moved to Deptford, in the south of the city, about 10 a.m., a British summer hour.
The driving driver stopped and a relief team stopped, but the cyclist broke in.
This collision takes place months after the death of another cyclist in a collision with escape on the Children's Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform their family members.
Barriers and deviations have been placed for cars, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lardin Prison: six wounded agents in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, referring to the Prisoner Gabinete.
The disturbances, still continuing, began at the HMP Long Lardin in Worcestershire about 09h30, the British summer time on Saturday.
Special "turned" agents were called to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a branch.
The agents received treatment of minor injuries at the local level.
A spokesman for the Prison Services said: "You have been using specially trained teams to solve the current incident in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received treatment of injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it must be clear that the names of the officials will be communicated to the police and these can take longer after the degrees."
The HMP Long Lardin is home to more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Furacão Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with current floods (the areas affected by drought can benefit)
It is rare a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is precisely what is expected for the beginning of the next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hole passes through the Southeast Desert, involving the risk of repeated flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued notice of sudden flooding to the south and east of Nevada, to the south of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct trajectory on Phoenix on Wednesday, approaching the end of the afternoon with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix referred to a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a fortress that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre of Furacons provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach 15 mm in Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the South-East Desert, such as the Central Rochos Mountains and the Great Basia, can be received 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those who are not affected by the risks of repeated flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southeast is currently affected by drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, little more than 40% of Arizona suffers at least extreme dryness, the second most serious category," reported the site weather.com.
First of all, Rosa will reach the continent's mass by crossing the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa, still with ironing force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal area in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the evening or at midnight on the afternoon.
There may be strong precipitation in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of floods.
"A total of 8 to 10 mm precipitations are expected from the Low California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum possible 25 mm," the site said.weather.com.
Rosa will then head north, traversing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of the morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the last hours of the third-party night.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her requisitions is the very high precipitation in the Low California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the Southwest of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and sudden floods of wastes in the deserts, with life-threatening risks, and floods in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests by attempted murder
Three adolescents of male sex and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with short-arm wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, near 4:00, a British summer time, on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains stable.
During the night, a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man in Radstock's area, contacted the Avon and Somerset police.
The agents called on everyone who could have mobile photos of what happened.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "was the victim of the Malika and the Rivalry" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the implacable and ultrasound tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the beginning of Wheeling, in West Virginia.
Trump referred to Kavanaugh as "the victim of malaria and anger" of the Democratic Party during its appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Friday, having strongly and emotionally rejected a Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually abused for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliant, quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said the majority of West Virginia supporters.
The president later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican influence to the Uranus in the inter-national elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I go all the way to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place by 6 February, declared to the CNN a key associate of the Directorate of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them were caught by giant waves that reached the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami reached the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities communicated on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with up to six feet high packed the beach at the end of the day, drawing many to death and causing a rush of destruction on their way.
The tsunami occurred following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came last night, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the accident," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, a spokesman from the agency to minimize the impact of Indonesia's disasters (BNPB) on a communication in Jacarta.
"Tsunami didn't move on its own: drove cars, trucks, houses, reached everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people took the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The public aerial photographs by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed bridges, and a close water mix.
The coastal city continued to be surrounded by reflections on the Sabbath.
The series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) referred to a statement that the energy released by the huge six-year fall was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and referred to thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels.
Some of the victims were found in the ruins of the damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and the damages can be deeper along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Dondrea, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Dongrea, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can worsen much more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had reached Palu, although the authorities had stated that waves had arisen at the time the warning was issued.
In a amateur film published on social networks, one can see a man in the upper floor of a building shouting sudden warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people in the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, drawing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut in energy that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo aircraft with Jacarta and other cities. However, refugees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was opened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia is growing exponentially for more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he has been able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the officials are staying in the shades of the valley mounted on the floor of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Dodhea crossed disaster scenes on his way, said Mr. Doseba.
"Tell me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to begin relief tasks for victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulation, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if this is declared "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still at a level of provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Red Cross Indonesia.
"As long as the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," we can open the doors to international assistance, but this statute does not yet exist."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunamis of 6 February, friends and family of the still missing kept the hope that their loved ones would become part of the miracles that touched the shadows of natural disasters.
On the Sabbath, a boy was taken away from an exodus.
On Sunday, the volunteers released a woman who had been trapped in the holes for two days beside the mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, trainer of the Indonesian national team of parapente, had trained two of his missing sportsmen for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The other guests at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandia, were their students.
"As a master coach of parapet, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told that, in the hours after the news of the Hotel Roa Roa's debation, he had begun to travel between the parapet community, sending messages to whatsApp for the Palu sportsmen, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a censorship check mark, instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Ladrons carry $26,750 during automatic box resuppression in Newport on the Level
On the sixth morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's officer who resupposes an automatic box in Newport on the Level, according to a communication from the Department of Police of Newport.
The car driver was deleting an automatic box in the variety set and preparing to introduce more money, referring to Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communication.
While he was busy, another man "sitted to run behind the Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the area, according to the communiqué, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about his identity should contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name--to Ye.
When announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "O being previously known by Kanye West."
At 41 years of age, West received some of Ye and used it as a title of his eight album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that your new Yandhi album is present.
This intervention is intended to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her for "emotional reasons", reported the actor of the show.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you", said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album next to the Big Boy radio presenter.
"Portant, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Come from Kanye, which means "the only", for only Yes - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers that changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternatively known by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference by the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West co-operative, JAY-Z, also used variations of its name with or without livers and major muscles.
In Mexico, AMLO is committed not to resort to civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed himself to refrain from using military force against civilians, as the country approached the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Soldiers shot against a peaceful demonstration in the square, on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that could have risen to 300, when left-wing student movements were implemented throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting them monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities arrest young people for criminal gangs.
The US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China strengthens its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research costs in this area, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements related to IA, although the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Doubling the IA research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new IA revolution," said Lee.
Double funding may double the chances of the next great success of the IA being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to the NCB in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synoving Ventures, a company that invested one of the most prominent IA companies in China, a Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked in an IA system that defeated Othello's best-classed American player. Later, he performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technological contests such as the Challenge Robotics of the Department of Defence for Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China who's stealing academic leaders; they're companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have hired universities to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changes in immigration policies can also help the US to put an end to its efforts in the IA field.
"I am of the opinion that green cards should be granted automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in the industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment this month in an initiative designated by AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA field research.
However, the legislation of the United States that seeks to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence is not yet in progress.
Macedonians vote in favour of the change in the country's name
The Macedonians were voting on Sunday to decide on the change in the name of the country to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a debate with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which integrates a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim on its territory and has seen its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on a new name proposal, but the nationalists argued that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly slave.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the poll will be sufficient to meet 50% of the requirements for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it for NATO and the EU to accept the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts of EU and NATO agencies to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to vote for the future of our country, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live free under the European Union's expectations, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the reference is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there had not been any irregular records until one afternoon.
However, the appeal was only 16%, compared with 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters represented to vote.
"We voted for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change in the name of the country, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small hall and placed chairs in front of the tents built by those who would vote for the referendum.
"We are NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top and not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to be received as Macedonia, we can direct others like China and Russia to become part of the Eureka integration."
First Minister Zaev said that NATO's entry will provide much-needed investment in Macedonia, which is a rate of unemployment of over 20%.
"I believe that most of our citizens will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published by the Macedonian Political Investigation Institute last February revealed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, a value lower than the necessary influence.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV Telma, revealed that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the appeal must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major concern in the pro-western government's policy since it took place in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City cross all the Bridgeton defense towards the golo
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot to defend Brighton in victory for 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday, Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'll make it look ridiculously easy in your throat at 65 minutes.
The Argentinian advanced received a passage in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
It ended a defense before neutralizing the race more in the boundaries of the Great Bridgeton area.
Then he took a walk to his left, where he was Sterling.
The English advance used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, which, with the right button, broke the Brighton Mathew Ryan's grid guard with a finish on the right side of the network.
"Agarlo is arguing with some problems on his feet," said the newspaperist Pep Guardiola, the city trainer.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had marked a bullet at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage against the Premier League.
That goose was marked at 29 minutes.
Agarero got the ball well in Brighton's territory in this game.
He took a step on the defenses along the left side of Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before leading Sterling towards the second track.
The Sky Blues' advance dropped the ball to the network immediately before moving out of the field limits.
The city faces Hoffenheim at 12 a.m. on Wednesday afternoon in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherger wants to make Rockies' life difficult
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another beginning.
However, the always competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the end of the Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had at least luck with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Saturday night, but they still intend to secure their title from the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can enter the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the title launcher for Sunday, but some say that they are inclined to allow Scherzer to effect the launch in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session in the bullpen on Thursday and launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right player from Washington goes with 18-7, with an ERA of 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries in this season.
Trip takes place in West Virginia
The President later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while referring to the importance of Republican influence in inter-selections.
"Everything we did is in play in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm all over the place to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democracies, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by using all the necessary means.
They don't care who climbs, who must pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats, he said, have the mission to "resist and obstetricate".
"And they've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, evil, cruel and lying."
The President referred to the name Dianne Feinstein, member of the Senate Judicial Committee, having received voices from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you choose to run the document?
Well, then, what?
No, um no, I, wait, one--that was a body language even worse--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party ceased to be inclusive.
It's intolerant for those who give their opinion openly
When the activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it didn't surprise me.
At the end of the accounts, I am the latest of a series of MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was a victim of a similar treatment because he faced anti-Semitism in a resolution.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for arguing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically issues similar to those that Jeremy had discussed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East working meeting in the sixth quarter mentioned that "we believe the meetings are inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local representative in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were precisely that.
Unfortunately, today, he has stopped being the volume of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and kind" policy has been very forgotten, if it has ever been concrete.
It has become increasingly apparent that different viewpoints are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not the party's leadership is acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues he thought shared a similar political perspective began to expect me a turnaround and take positions with whom he would never agree - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
When I speak in public (and do not really matter what I say), there is a torrent of abuse on social networks that call for "missing", accusing the central policies, telling me that I must not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I am terrified of professionalism and the determination of these colleagues who face a range of sexual or racist insults every day, but who never complain before them.
One of the things that makes me more disappointed in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we stop being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or modification of the rules of selection, the party narrows its eyes.
I received numerous advice over the last two years, urging me to keep my head down, so that I would not be so expressive, and that would "be all right" for me.
But that's not what I came to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, implicated by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher who left the classroom of my school literally covered in pieces, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who are most in need, whether as an author or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promote the movement on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will damage families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "missing" or political agents will prevent me from acting in the sense that I believe will be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: from the imperishable Ayr to the top
Two late trials sent the result in some way, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this incorrigibly interesting game of Tennt's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten without defeat.
In the end, it was a higher defense and better management of the risks that the house team had made to take the best, and trainer Peter Murchie had all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we continue to be imperceptibly, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to the Ayr. They'd risk better than us."
Grant Anderson's test in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, awarded the game by the Warriors, enabled Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason Baggot used an unconverted test.
Climate extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the medium-time, had marked and then turned a single test to place the marker in 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose began well to the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption was followed due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was transported from cow to the outside and, after the re-commencement, Ayr strengthened the leadership with a test of Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
Ayr's executive captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the digital advantage with an unconverted test by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense investment of pressure.
However, the house team returned, and when Sruan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having destroyed the ball without the ball, in the launch of the penalty, MacPherson put the ball in the ground behind the bullet in the progress of the Ayr.
Climo turned, as he had done almost immediately following the reinstatement, after Kyle Rowe had collected David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth test of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular series, who writes and participates with the long-term food partner Greg Hemphil.
The couple announced that the ninth season, the short staring, will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is Director of the Affygorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was pretending to be involved in the "floating business of Glasgow restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land deprived of ritual, expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Mariners patrol a ship covered with rope in La Paz.
Public buildings host a blue-season flag.
The ship bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazons bear the motto: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
For the whole of Bolivia, a landless country, the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile is still alive in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the highest point of decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impetence, a spirit of unity and seriousness and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will assist in the exercise of the TIJ's judgment on giant screens spread by the country, hoping that the Hague court will deal in favour of the claim of its country, so that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate, giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian Indian president, who faces a controversial battle by re-election in the coming year, also has much to play in the trial of the second-February.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," were the president's votes last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not even change in the case of the contrary.
The United Nations body, with its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chile to another country and has stressed that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ's judgment is pronounced only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert at international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of sea access was blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' bleging retortory reduced some good residual favor in Chile, he suggested.
At a time in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in Hawaii, rejected the idea that the court's decision process was rapidly involving.
The next Tuesday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end up to 139 years of mutual benefit disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also admitted that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political model.
"Bolivia will never be deprived of its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country's trust in the US
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said that his nation would never face its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
Their comments arise when U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in the first place, more than three months after Singapore's summit with North-Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri pointed out that it is an "inconsistent dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and opposition of the US to a declaration which puts an end to the Korean war will sometimes lead the North to join.
Washington refused to accept the declaration without giving Pyongyang first significant steps in the direction of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a generalised ceticism as Pyongyang has real intentions to reduce an arsenal that the country is still likely to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang in the month that comes to prepare a second Kim-Trup summit.
fashion drawings in Paris reveal the most recent line of huge hats along the way of a store near the
If you intend to expand your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, you do not need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented in the past a series of extravagant and over-sized hats for their spring- summer 2019 collections, which left the set style in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these exciting creatures to pass it.
The most prominent part of Valentino was an extravagance beige hat decorated with a wide bead similar to a pen that changed the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewellery melanomas, a fetish hat and even analytes, although they have not been designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks... even at the time of the Carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cut lips and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than with high costumes.
One of the creatures looked like the sail equipment, with tubes and eyes, while another looked like a frozen ice dog.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, it's lucky.
Observers of estylism predict that these huge hats are on the way from a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent in the "La Bomba", the shoe hat with a width of 61 cm that has been used by all people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind the very little practical one learned that it spread through the social networks sent another great creation for the passageways: a beach bag on the floor almost as large as the model on the ground that carried it.
The hot orange-coloured raffle bag, decorated with raffle francs and with a white heart grip, was the most prominent part of the spring-ever La Riviera 2019 collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous estilleist Luke Armitage told the F.C.C.: "I'm waiting to see big hats and beach bags arrive at the store for the next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from an academic excellence curriculum, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place among global citizens.
Since this is a educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum to measure, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter into his heart."
This quote well reminds us that we cannot rely only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent studies this year, we check that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students studying foreign languages reached the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in 74 schools under the elevation of SCIS, showed that 72% of students received the maximum A in mandarim, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent Scottish schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills that will inevitably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now in the same way that STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are in the curriculums of independent schools and not just themselves.
An investigation by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Competence in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulty of employees in filling vacancies, 17% said about the lack of language skills.
Therefore, learning other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to require language knowledge, these competences are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language enough to keep a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
So investing now in language learning is important for today's children.
The field of various languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children with better opportunities to find employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by specialized teachers in the area.
Independent Scottish schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need for success, that is, what the future holds for them.
It is impossible today, in a globalised business environment, language remains of fundamental importance for the country's future. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect on it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "International communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish students.
You need to do it.

LeBron begins at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is ending for the fans who want to see LeBron James start in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in the pre-emergency opening game against the dinner Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you'll play is still about to determine.
"It will be more than one and less than 48, said Walton on the official Lakers' website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet claiming that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the coaches at the beginning of this week, James was investigated on his plans for the calendar of six games of the Lakers in the pre-time.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of YouTube from the start of Trump in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled beginnings for the next week, which includes paragnes in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote pending for your election to the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the inter-sessional elections to be held shortly, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is the start of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The start of Trump in Wheeling, in the West Virginia, is marked for the 7th afternoon, East Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You will be able to attend the start of Trump in West Virginia online below in a live transmission on YouTube.
Trump will probably address the hearings this week to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court, who became tense because of the allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote in the Senate will wait for a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this start-up torrent is to help the Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, gain some influence.
Thus, officials of President Trump's campaign said that these five beginnings in the coming week "are trying to give energy to volunteers and supporters as long as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority that remain in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so fundamental to the president's agenda that it will visit as many states as possible as possible, as we approach the attack of the campaign period," said a spokesman from the Trump campaign that was rejected to be quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the start of the night logo can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which it won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, in favour of the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in his research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows that it has forces to fight to keep the hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday mornings may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impetuous is a totally invented sports concept, but it is one in which players really believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the impeccable would come now?
"There's a six-point advantage and now there's four, so we're dealing with it as a little impeccable," Jordan Spieth said while he was out of the field at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, benefiting from four points ahead and more than twelve in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points in four.
Spieth has been the killer of the tea to the green and is leading the example.
Those party guitar screams were getting higher as the round continued, with a crucial pout that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind two.
His poutt that won the game on the 15th produced a similar cry, which shows that he still believes that the American team continues to compete.
"It is only necessary that we concentrate and worry about our own game," said Spieth.
That's all the rest of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European pair, which is unlikely but worshipable, is four in four and cannot be wrong.
The "Molywood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Saturday afternoon and on the snowy back on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way its energy seems to flow from and for this turbulent crowd, the idea is that they are players to fight on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to celebrate a potential European victory to the sun in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
In preference, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the debate on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the Fourballs this morning, when he was on team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the snow covered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that was never close to getting out.
However, on Sunday no one can help them get out of it.
The furballs and fursoms are as fascinating as seeing close due to the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not and how the strategy can change at once.
Europe has played better on teams so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this forum session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 leadership on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter on the last day of Ryder Cup with a full advantage after leaving the football and games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead in front of the United States.
The two inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the classification in Le Golf National, up to now, of four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, struggling to preserve the trophie that was lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failed American team in the morning's suburbs, winning the series by 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the two-party forums, but they did not achieve the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's Sunday 12 to keep the trophi.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received some of "Mollywood", after a seven-week sensitious weekend, are the only duet to win four points in their four opening parts in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having stripped Woods and Patrick Reed on the Fourballs, they super-consolidated the advantage, defeating a Woods without energy and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more infamous 5&4.
Woods, who had been arrested for two parties on Saturday, revealed occasional geniuses, but he already lost 19 of the parties he argued in furballs and Forsoms, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stanson on the fours, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third ranked world ranking.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze in the south-west of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, winner for three times of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
The couple gained a brave victory of 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, from Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the forums, losing both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history did a team invert a disadvantage of four points before the singles, although Furyk's team, the holder of the title, just needed to empathize to preserve the trophie.
After two days in second position, an attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "to think" of a unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was building confidence in the United States and that the country was not able to unify its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the demilitarization of the nuclear test centre and the commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our first disarmament."
Although Ri has recyclable North-Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, its declarations appear significant as they do not necessarily reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast with the previous positions of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit once held between a U.S. president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to working in the sense of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang has first left his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the heavy international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, opposing even the "declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us in jail is an impossible dream for people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the United States leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party concerned were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stage."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that directing North Korea's Fogats towards the US territory was inevitable after Mr. Mau' Trump had called Kim the "man of the Foggets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, that last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for her courage to take steps in the direction of disarmament, but stated that much was still to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump said he did not have a calendar for this, referring to "the two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue very hard until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to exclude the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in North Korea.
Pompeo met with Ri at the side of the UN General Assembly and said after he visited Pyongyang again in the month he came to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit failed.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, even though after North Korea had accused him of "doing gangster requirements.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to disarming a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "responsible measures" they sought were the security guarantees adopted by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year enabled all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machinist culture to study in busy "directs" of caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of this university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts of care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sound medical professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believed to be the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last, a girl came with me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, administered for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course of one hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee boxes, cortinas, salads and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about the way the athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to gather to bed.
In another section participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think on their daily routines.
"We know that the behavior of the students will not change instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the effects on the health of the option of smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct making" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep well and in quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid stabbing, because the privatization of sleep puts the brain in a way of hunger, making them constantly exhumated.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after having attended one of his studies last year in Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students who attend a similar study program before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students who measure the use of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as to agree, and who have awareness of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can rule the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goblet destroys Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another sadness outside the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused the disintegrated team of Steven Gerarrd a defeat for 1-0 in the Livingston season.
Ibrox's team tried to record its first victory on their journey from the triumph for 1-0 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team finally attacked Gerard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind disappointed Hearts, leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga marked seven minutes before the end of the first part and the collection of Rangers, lacking inspiration, never seemed equal.
With the Rangers now going down to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third, and only behind the Hibernian by the difference of gooses.
And even more problems may arise for Rangers after the Calum Spence liner has received treatment of a head injury caused by an object apparently affected by the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that exceeded Ayr in the middle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on his side, used the 11th of Livingston that stole a point to Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-wrought team put the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of ball, but Livingston did more than he had.
The team could have marked it in two minutes, when the first step was sent by Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ball, but the average lost its great opportunity out.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free spot was at the meeting of Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish off the second track.
Rangers was able to recover control, but hope was greater than belief in his game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he should have been given a great sentence in the quarter with his coliition with Steven Lawless, but Archbishop Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
The Rangers only got two finals to the ball first, but Ibrox Liam Kelly's old guard grid had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's failed end.
Although Livingston's goal at 34 minutes may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is impossible that the team deserved it, as far as it is not due to its tenacity.
But once again, Rangers couldn't cope with a ball game standing away from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher took a step for Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finalization.
Gerrard moved in the interval, replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to take a long walk after a long walk.
The Holt team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor did well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow finished out.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he called in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: Geiger Count Inventor
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, CONTAR ... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that just led to the device known as the Geiger accountant.
Since then, the Geiger accountant has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as an uranium.
When we put these auriculars, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans, "Look, now you're cramping!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention he gave his name was still lost.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient and its modification to the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then re-injected into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a series of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries to disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells of a patient and its modification in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of the mother, the ovary, the lungs and also the colorretites, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and "instructing them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West aboard a support diaribe to Trump carrying a MAGA hat after its appearance in SNL.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
Kanye West went to the study on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistencies in which U.S. president Donald Trump said he would apply for presidential elections in 2020.
After running his night song, named Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began a bravery against the Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, where Hollywood stared at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's Trial Committee on the allegations of sexual aggression made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the West Bravata scene was published on social networks by the eater Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to switch from West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that there had been a bad blow on the boaters because of the hat.
"They scared me in the bazaars.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
I'm scared!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?" saying, "I put my super-human layer, because that means nobody tells me what to do.
Try love."
His comments provoked public departures and participants in SNL appeared to be embarrassed, said Variety, having one of the program said to the newspaper: "The whole study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the execution of song I Love it disappointed with Perrier's glove.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our most courageous spirits: OBRIGADO BY ENFRENTERS TO TURBA".
However, the interview programmer Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NO to reward someone (by understanding your music or by supporting your "art") who I believe is to embrace and promote harmful ideology for the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that it was now "the first known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the past of Diddy, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rapper has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince has changed its name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Homicide prosecution after excavating in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was exaggerated at a restaurant in the eastern area of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The hearing is expected to be presented by the Belfast Tribunal on Monday.
The charges will be analysed by the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Star of the Battle of the Tronos Kit Harington Attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a striker like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of the HBO, War of the Thrones.
However, at 31 years of age, the actor attacked the stereotype of the machiist hero, claiming that such papers on the screen make boys feel that they must be hard to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit referred to believing that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who had recently happened to his colleague in the war on the Rose Leslie Thrones, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "very strong position" about addressing the problem.
"I have a very strong personal position at this time: what is wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been going to teach men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he went on, "What is it and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change this?
'Cause obviously something ran very bad for the young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any pre-wares or riots when the series ends in the next summer, referring to that for him, the "war camps and horses" were completed.
From November, Kit will participate in a version of True West from Sam Shepard, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Trons War.
"I know my wife in this series, so in some way she gave me my future family and my life here before," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy with Emmys.
The marriage took place in June 2018 in the fields of the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% drop in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities have said.
Almost 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to virtually zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Studies estimate that, due to the country's conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of diseases result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters immediately avoids information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks the "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dismissed on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on the pages of Wikipedia of the legislators.
The democracy of Los Angeles stated that the charges were promoted by opinion leaders and websites of the "ultradireita".
"Ministers, lies and most disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information published includes randomly the homes and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during an hearing with a panel of the Senate on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court.
The information escape took place some time after the three senators have asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data from a member of the Waters staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were committed to such fraudulent and false claims, had no responsibility in this information escape.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleescher.
"This nonsense is Coleric," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests that she does not have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that isn't their responsibility, he can't be secular.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't ask the accused's reasons.
You have to reveal peace and sincerity."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of being too curious during the Friday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will discuss Waters' place in the intercalar elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's very serious if it's true," he read on his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" of these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Critic of Johnny English Back to Attack - failure of spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now possible to look for contacts with Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and this seems to be the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and re-traded in 2011 with "The Regress of Johnny English".
Is the ironic auto-set on the subject of being so bad is the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes thrown out and an excessive elastic expression obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, which is a vast chemical creation for non-englophone cinemas.
He is, of course, an idiot's secret agent who, despite his strange claims to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that pulan who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Hloria moments" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
In addition, his character was originally based on the traveler and an international mysterious man whose role atkinson played in TV ads to Barclaycard, who left the fall on his track.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I love the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter carrying a medieval armor, with the rotor belts soon making a noise of carilion against the capate.
Atkinson's talent for the comedy is obvious, but the humor alone is weak and strangely superior, especially since the editions of films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose the comedy as an ingredient.
We have come to the idea that the humor is directed to children and not adults and, in my view, the strange adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as the film numbers moved from Atkinson into Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always today, is that Great Britain is being put in a serious mess.
A computer pirate invested in the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground for harassment of the service agent, a slightly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a prime minister who carries a bold and conflicting figure, to suffer already a total failure of political instability: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds him of Theresa May's character, but the argument does not give much material to large flights.
Your consultants of secret services inform you that, since all agents in the assets have been committed, you will have to get someone out of the reform.
And this person is the disaster Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a small school, but giving informal lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a school of spying in the style of the film "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and reunite with his auxiliary Bugh, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attracted to a submarine commander, an exciting character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the disaster at His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being threatened by the billionaire charisma of technology that claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain: Jason Volta left, performed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their rejection of absurd acts of destruction: disillusioned people of the table, burned a sighted French restaurant, created confusion as clandestine prisoners in the luxurious Yate of Volta, and English developed pure anarchy as he tried to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the inside of the Volta house.
All paradigms were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the most sympathetic and tense, the set has enough TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop wondering: wouldn't the British cinema industry be able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that justifies his talent?
Workers are planning a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be weighing a radical plan to provide Britishs a four-day work week, but with five-day pay.
Reports suggest that the party wants the patrons to resuscitate the holidays with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for the workers, giving them an additional day of mourning.
The workers obtained a three-day weekend, but kept the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjusting" the party's economic programme, which reorientes the country to the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week received the favorable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a form of workers taking part in the changes in the economy.
A senior official of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It won't happen one day to the other, but a four-day working week is a suitable aspirations for the party's approach to the rebalance of the economy for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a work week of four days during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this ambition is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
Minister of Finance shadow John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to recover the power from the hands of the "indirectors without face" and the "expectors" of the basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total quota of current water business shareholders, as the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees in company management councils and create inclusive equity funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which can pay annual dividends that can rise to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation in Kavanaugh can do them or not change ideas
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of its appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be delivered on Sunday, the representative of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would change their ideas.
Kennedy showed himself more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"So when he came to the hearing, he said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
Did I call you after this happened when this complaint appeared and I asked you, "Did you do it"?
He was resolved, determined, inexhaustible."
Graham's vote, however, seems immeasurable.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and would need an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a strong denial," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on a equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Central Park's Great Relevado, not only to assist in activities such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness for the truth of the event's objective: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defence group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) the players had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteers, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways to increase awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the success rate of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clicitivism" - do we find that it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters, who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and ads arising from its actions, having at least $10 billion in respect of the same funds as already paid or committed.
The group estimates that the funds received have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom, bringing together investors and implementing partners committed to "help children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and the Global Citizens as well as all of us, we can make the social injustice of the sub-nutrition a sign of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group further stated that, after more than 5000 press actions on the United Kingdom in order to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and painful journey - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements by civil rights and anti-parity that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the artists who will be working on this year's event in New York, presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the sea as a "block" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington may travel to its sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke pointed out that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where they intervene in the invitation of the legitimate government, is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they intend to intervene in energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south coast of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means of preventing it.
"The United States has the ability, with its sea, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to make blocks to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke directed participants to an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In its intervention, it continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to that they are actually the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to improve and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, instead of Russia, which is the most expensive option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including the own president, have tried to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has become a "prison" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, intends to double existing capacity for 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, dealing with an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, the senior member of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will take a deep look at the possibility of candidate to the presidency in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on the Saturday that "the possibility of candidates for the presidency to follow the inter-sessional elections will be "to examine deeply".
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would weigh the possibility of applying.
"It has reached the height of women going to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the ultimate responsibility," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a deep look at the possibility of candidates for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, referring to "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a hard vocal critic of Trump and his name for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren pointed out that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey carried out on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents are not of the opinion that she should apply to the presidency in 2020.
59% of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% give their support to their candidate.
The survey showed a higher support than a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party discussed with regard to a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at Donald Trump's beginning
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his arrest in September.
On Tuesday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what is going on after he's gone back, I can identify myself with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the injuries with which our soldiers, in fact, are coming back," said Donald Trump in support of a company in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "are a little different, they're tired, they're wondering if there's this respect for his fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the armed forces have left the country".
Track Palin was arrested on the second Friday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman from the Department of Police of Vasilla.
Ten states and the Columbia District support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Ten states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge of a new policy of the United States that rejects asylum victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and districts sent a friend's statement (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is responding to this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union introduced in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused him, but the US authorities denied his asylum request on 20 July.
The complaint was held in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision of the Council of Immigrant Resources that would allow immigrants without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney-General of the Columbia District Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "includes decades of state, federal and international laws".
"The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be appreciated on the basis of specific facts and circumstances that are subject to them; this prohibition violates this principle", read in the friend's statement curiae.
Lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants by the police negatively affects the US economy, referring to the fact that they themselves are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "make available the necessary labour".
Prosecutor-General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or hunger on the basis of ethnic, religious, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," said Sessions in their announcement of politics on 11 June.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all problems, not even all serious problems, which people face every day throughout the world.
Unexpected rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubles in a counter-relogge to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a febrile baby of male sex, comforting her in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambiguity brings more bodies.
There's a waste of clean water."
Residents were warned to return to their destroyed houses to try to save everything they could find among their water-consumed properties.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquakes were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who had broken the bones and the shoulder, were outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to the strong replications they continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported how he felt when the violent earthquake threw him out of the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with the woman and the daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris said to Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "addicts of propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper has published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Thursday to China's pay-up supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most outlawed newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the elections on 6 November for Congress, a charge rejected by China.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently making a increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff barriers on the imports of the other.
China's termination rates at the initial stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states supporting the Republican Tromp Party, Chinese and North American specialists said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products for China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, wrote Branstad in an article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "he is now putting his foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press".
"With the dissemination of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the established American tradition of freedom of expression and of press publishing an ad to be paid in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have from the worrying economic trajectory of their country, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese journals refused the offer to publish" his article, although it did not mention which.
Republicans alienize women's voters before the intercalar elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
While many important Republicans support and defend what is appointed for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh to face various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts believe that this could lead to a negative reaction, particularly among women, during the inter-sessional elections to take place in the near future.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to advance to a vote.
These things don't go back," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher claimed that the last hour pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) for carrying out a FBI investigation would be sufficient to surprise the rebels.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman of the progressive movementOn group, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is at the door!" when they showed up at the Senate hall, as the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to advance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's witness, told Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said news site Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without a partnership.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the decision-makers in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public witness described his allegations of sexual aggression against the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans advanced with confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge. It's also about the way the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities, a group that helps to choose Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be something divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with a small majority to associate with the first.
A new survey of YouGov revealed that 41% of the applicants had absolutely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they had absolutely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh might have been lying or absolutely lying to his witness, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI launched an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford mentioned under an oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had been sexually troubled while drinking, when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the term for the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when they both attended a party during the period they were both studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to revalidize with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this legendary character of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that has taken part in the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said playingly that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage", or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data storage is that only the user should decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and competences to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteers.
Starting this week, world-wide technology makers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are driven from one day to the other.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a medium publication on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic with this coming Web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honoring the Condecorated Clergy with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a warrior was honored in its birth city over 100 years.
Lieutenant-Coronnel Reverdo Bernard Vann obtained the condecoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a Franco-Athirator four days later and never knew he had received the highest British military honour.
His two grandsons broke down a memorial plate in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that it gave the comfort to her grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Cornel Vann led his battle on the crossing of the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very large cloud and under a closed fire of portable and metal weapons".
Then he ran to the fire line and, "with the greatest bravery," led the line forward before he attacked himself a cannon and hit three soldiers from the highlight.
Lieutenant-Cornel Vann was killed by a German striker on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know would never be equal, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a flock of flowers after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the validity of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through support that will be given by many people."
Faces of mixed martial arts agreed all night to see Bellator 206 attends instead to Porca Peppa
Imagine this: it is agreed all night to see Bellator 206, full of views and, finally, it is forbidden to see the main event.
San José's series included 13 battles, with six of the main groups, and was being presented directly during the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the confrontation, the players in the United Kingdom were frightened when the cover changed to Pcca Peppa.
Some have not been impressed after having been agreed until the wedding especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change for animated drawings for children as "a kind of bad-ass beach".
"The government regulation says that content is not suitable for the six in the morning, so they had to change for another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing and communication threshold when asked about the transmission.
"Porca Peppa," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said that the same would rectify the transmission calendar to include the United Kingdom's players in the future.
"I think, when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
"But it's six Sundays there and we can't solve it until our Sunday hour, which is the second fair in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that, when the programming changed, there were many mixed messages and no very nice ones.
We're trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually did.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
The Olympic leader Tom Daley said that he grew up to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete pointed out that he didn't appear until he entered school that "we are all like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he showed himself in favour of the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said to become his father to worry less about winning the Olympics.
The program's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a series of months of illness.
Looking like a couple in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone because "he wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of us feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and the strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was "someone", he said, not to disqualify everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The two Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
According to him, he appeared because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give others "hope".
The World Championship referred to being in love with a man, American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I was surprised".
Daley happened last year with Oscar's winner, 20 years old, although he has stated that the difference of age has never been a problem.
"When we go through so much when we're so new" - its first participation in the Olympic Games was at the age of 14 and Father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has passed by similar heights and lows.
The couple had a son last June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all their perspectives" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 for 40 years after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley pointed out that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell you "You're not going to be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I was sure he wasn't hand-in-hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't inventive," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and obtained a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: walking in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympics... there was no better feeling," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, of Heather Small - with which he had been identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs spends on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer.
Mickelson downstairs in the bank on Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will reach a record on Saturday when discussing his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the frame from symbolizing an unhappy occasion.
Mickelson, to play on the 12th anniversary event, a record of participation, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk on the Fourballs and Saturday Forsoms.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as has been in the United States teams so many times, the five-time winner of the major male champions divided the day between the support function and the work in their game in the field, hoping to rectify what it is doing.
Having never given up the most rarely even at the top of your career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long-term rough normally punishs the wrong tacks.
And if the field alone wasn't scary enough, Mickelson, on the ninth Sunday, will face the exact British Open Francesco Molinari campaign, which made a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all the four parties they discussed this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single parties, record a good start, the Mickelson game can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role I had today, gave me a palm on my shoulders, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
It's a respected campaign that has made these teams huge in the past, and also this week.
I probably didn't care to see him play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will skip Nick's record on Sunday for the largest number of games in Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never been equal to the success of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 victories and seven empathies, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun meeting with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives much more than just to play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear on a plane
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his leadership when entering the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danish had its star in the battle of 1997 in Valderrama, where a team headed by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the target line with the nariz with the most narrow of the margins, winning by 141⁄2-131/2.
"We have always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but not for a while," said Bjorn, in the image, after having assisted the victory of the 2018 Turma for 5-3, both on Saturday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 in Le Golf National.
Thus, history has shown me to me and everyone on this team that this has not yet ended.
Tomorrow, give your best.
They're going there and doing everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus must remain.
I've always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of who's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of his players in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow's important are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there for our account, our powers as golfers are tested at the maximum.
This is the message you need to send to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they will leave the partner and he must go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than as partners, making the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
The Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it ended to lose when Europe took off the cart the "Milagre in Medinah".
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that start as quickly as you saw in Brooklyn and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impasse is directed towards one side, the pressure is very large in these middle parties.
We organized our effectiveness in conformity and ordered the players in the way we feel, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission to try to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers all the trajectory," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
A new German warship once more
The latest piece of German sea would have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the time of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait for at least until next year, due to the systems of adventures and a cost of exponential growth, according to local media.
The entry to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the latest fragmented Baden-Wuertemberg class, was now added until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which mentioned a military voice.
The ship should have joined the sea in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertmberg class that the sea had ordered in 2007 will serve as replacements for the broken old ones of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of ancient missiles and anti-ships, as well as some winding technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include more dilated periods between maintenance, which would allow the most recent broken down in missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the port of origin.
However, the latter have made it possible that with the warships of the last generation, considered as a form of Germany's planning beyond-border power, they will already be detached when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unsuccessful F125 broke loose made manchets last year when the German Navy refused to place it in service, having returned it to the stables of the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine returned a ship to the stable after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media mention a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a fight mission.
The software deficits were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, only half of the quota required in the oldest broken ones of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the sea’s ability to install additional features in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is thought to have the good weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the total project price, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached EUR 3.1 billion, an increase of 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems of the most recent fragile have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, recognized that the sea is currently unmanned with ships capable of being used."
The politician said that the problem had grown exponentially over time, as older ships were placed out of service without ships to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wertemberg's classes had been able to join the sea.
National Trust Saves the Secret Life of the Beasts
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how the ants use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to affect some light on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long ears castles and Daubenton's bats in the Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the activities of the ants along the station.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS personnel and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will assess the frequency of calls from the ants and what each species is doing.
It will then be produced a map of the habitat to create a detailed picture of its behaviour on the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important for the mammals and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as the best way to ensure the maintenance of forests for mammals and associated species.
The population of swine fever in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has grown significantly over the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development work that affects the bedrooms and make habitat disappear.
Eolitic turbines and explosives are also a threat, along with the killing papers and some chemical treatment of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the ants are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, is very serious.
The organisation has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, dormitories inspections and sometimes rescues.
It has also come to create the first reserve in Scotland exclusively dedicated to pigs, in Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of Scottish pigs.
Property Director David Thompson says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrive we have an excellent area for dogs," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many Veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the ants that we do not know, so the work that we are developing here and in other properties will help us learn more about what they need to flourish."
It stressed the importance of checking whether there are pigs before maintenance in the property, as the non-intended destruction of just one maternity bedroom can lead to the death of up to 400 young women and young animals, which could lead to the total destruction of the local population.
The dogs are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, kill them, disturb them or destroy their bedrooms.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate in helping.
It was because she said, "We still have much to learn about our mammals, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are coming."
Ronaldo dismiss allegations of rape when his lawyers prepare to process German journals
Christian Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advancement of the Portuguese election and the Juventus was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that it will then pay $375 000 to keep the victim silent about the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a video directly on Instagram to its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," he said to the camera the winner of five Gold Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspects in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they have been found in a night club, Ronaldo and Maorga will have randomly gone to the player's room, where that person will have violated it anyway, in accordance with the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo put himself out of jail after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good type", damaged by "one per cent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that marriage had sexual relations, but that was consensus.
Majorga also claims that she was directed to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she will later agree to enter into an extrajudicial agreement by feeling "terrorized by the prospect of execution" and being concerned about the possibility of "publicly humiliated".
The woman, aged 34, says now that she intends to cancel the agreement, because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was ready to join the Royal Madrid, from the exit of Manchester United, at the height of the alleged aggression. This summer changed to the Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "repent-it always" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "repent itself forever" has lost its status as world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said the Secretary to Greg Clark Enterprises.
Clark also pointed out that Toyota in the United Kingdom had stated to the BBC that, if Great Britain had left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer pointed out that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit could lead to loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Auris and Avenis models of Toyota, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that, if Britain comes out of the EU incorrectly at the end of March, we will see the production patterns in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concern about the EU's exit without agreement with the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, mentioned that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to the fact that manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with pieces coming up every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured by command.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be border disturbances, which the sector says can lead to delays and loss of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in its Derbyshire factory, he said the company, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that allows, as he said, not only the current success but also the use of this opportunity for us," said the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it had not been able to provide an estimate of the time of suspension, Toyota pointed out that, in the long term, increased costs reduced the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinated the United union in this area, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back again.
A government spokesman stated that "we have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
A meeting of Trump with Rosenstein can be added again, says Casa Branca
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "added another week" given that there is still no understanding about Brett Kavanaugh, named for the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's advisers and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The fact that Trump can be preparing the dispatch of the Deputy Attorney-General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of unmistakably recording the talks with Trump and the possibility to depose the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disproved the information.
But last Friday he moved to the White House, with information that he would be ready to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, which was held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "it would not be preferable to send" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then added to prevent the overposition with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Saturday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press adviser, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, may be this week but may also be added a week, bearing in mind all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders does not organize a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a violation of the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said, "I would not disagree with the fact that they like protagonism."
Then he must understand that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President has more questions and answers than any previous president has done," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have analysed these numbers."
Press conferences will continue to occur, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is far better than talking to me.
We tried to do this frequently and saw that we had done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they could talk to the President of the United States replaced any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
The press conferences alone are rare.
This week, the President showed why in New York, he appeared undisputedly and sometimes strangely before the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in the Swedish National Health Service on Brexit Retirements
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Swedish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter at least six months after the EU's exit.
The Swedish government has already committed itself to cost candidates to the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services in the country.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "Over the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal were pending decisions for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate at this time how valuable the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality, is.
Members of the whole EU and other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after suffering injuries in the head
The defense of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was submitted to an emergency surgery after suffering injuries in the head during the weekend for 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ, the Tigers.
The coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the side line and practically disappeared," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying it in a bag and transporting it to a deeper evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, stopped the studies during the first time with the Tennessee State Tigers after an Illinois transfer.
He made five posters on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18 posters.

A higher stamp tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to non-abets, will be announced today Theresa May.
The measure is dealt with as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate, with promises of making a more accessible accommodation and taxing the highest income.
The rise in the seal tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to stimulate the government's campaign to offer a free tea.
The ceiling - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and purchases for rent - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to reach up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, raising prices and making it difficult for first-house buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in capital - have become "fathom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a cut of the seal tax to help young people acquire their first room.
He asked the large construction companies to maintain the prices of the properties raised to the ccambarcaret land that they do not use, demanding that Mrs. May leave the quotas on the rooms available to resolve the "difficulty of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of the "no justification".
He also wants to assign extended powers to the municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "In last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is so easy to buy houses for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as well as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of your house has become too far and the shame of who sleeps at rest continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland trainer Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is coming to become the electorate of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish has been successful in the challenge of giving a new life to the Northeast club, currently third-classed in the First League, the three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after directing St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division in the past.
"Who represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalization B," Ross said to the BBC's Sports Sound program in Scotland.
"I wish to see Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will arise only if he has succeeded in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland trainer include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic trainer says that he did not feel afraid when the names so dedicated to a club of so great size, after rejecting invitations from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, now the success is called "can I take the club back to Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of the club, its location is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'm just going to think that I did well here when I reach that goal."
Ross' career as a trainer has only three years, after a period of time as an auxiliary trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
The Alloa then helped recover from the decline to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the title of the campaign at the next time.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartplepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking account of Allaa's "was a true encrusted," remember.
"I've always seen me more in the role of trainer than in the player.
It looks strange because it worked well, I got my life as a player, and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We've faced many challenges every week.
I still face the stress and pressures of the job, but I feel very well as a trainer.
You always want to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I ever felt during my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 a.m. Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave covered the British pubs, but it put more pressure on restaurants chains.
The restoration groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants increased by 4.8%, they showed statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA consultant, who compiled statistics, said: "The continuation of the good time and career of England in the Football World Championship, longer than expected, made it possible that the standard of the month of June, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% increase in sales, was repeated in July, but restaurants knew a harvest.
The loss of 1.8% registered in the sale of the restaurant in June fell in July.
The pubs and bars with the business of drinking were far from the best performance, with a homologous growth more than compensated for the decline in restaurants.
The pubs with the business absent in the meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, with meals to collect 3%."
Paul Newman, an analysis of the laser and RSM restoration sectors, said: "These results extend the trend we have been recording since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sports events continue to be the main factors affecting the sale of food outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when it comes to the extension of the cost pressure.
The longer and hot summer could not reach the operators with the non-repetition business. Only time will tell if the most dangerous temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the expansion of the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined business volume of over 9 billion pounds, being recognised as the benchmark of the sector.
One in every five children hidden from parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts on social networks that hide parents and teachers, revealed a study.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "false" pages in Instagram
The news angers the news about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "primary" account to show parents
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news angered the news about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an independent "primary" account to show their parents, having at the same time private accounts.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found out that the teenager encouraged the others "to rape her".
The study conducted by Digital Awarenss UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which allowed to keep private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces online where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Elidh Doyle was elected Executive Director of the Scottish Council of Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most practical medalist of Scottish athletics. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their wide international experience over the last decade.
"Eilih is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and global community of athletics and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have much to gain with their presence in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute truly to help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre test in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commenter in the BBC, stopped going after a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's a month ago that is suffering from a brain vascular accident.
I stopped going.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could get it back and as far as I can.
It's been a painful job but it's a total recovery, I've learned to walk and I've even been practicing agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
An announcement of milk extraction bomb compares mothers to cows, dividing online opinions
A milk extracting company shared online opinions with an ad that compares mothers who love cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent milk extracting bomb", Elvie's consumer technology company launched an ironic announcement inspired in music videos to highlight the freedom conferred by the new milk-drawing moms.
Four mothers dance in a full-fledged vacuum at the sound of a music that includes verses such as, "Yes, I'm ordering myself, but I don't have a fall" and "If you haven't repaired, I don't have tits, these are my seats."
The rehearsal continues: "Bombies, bombs, baby food, bombs, bombs, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it eases the "horrors" of the Latinos sector.
"You decide to use cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to pregnant and give light to produce milk, only their babies are robbed a few days after their birth," wrote a viewer.
The Elvie extraction bomb rides discreetly within a breast-feeding suite (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's obviously traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone said, "A announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarant".
"I think it's a great idea.
If he was still eating, he'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a crazy joke, but it makes all sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad directed to mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like "wakas".
It is not an announcement to praise or judge the Latin sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discrepancies located in the suites.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, there are no wires or tubes and heads discreetly within a breast-feeding suite, giving women the freedom to move, to get their babies out of the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that deserves an angry and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a funny way and that people can identify the amazing feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time Elvie bomb was missing.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children jumped into the corridor to design Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children placed discreetly for a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, despite the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unaltered, partly because the rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the administration of Trump have made it difficult for children to be brought up.
Traditionally, most of the "births" are themselves undocumented immigrants, trying to compromise their own ability to stay in the country while offering themselves to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults who integrate their family associations would have to record their digital impressions, being the data shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior employee of the Alfandengese Immigration and Control Service, witnessed before the Congress that the service holds tens of people who have applied to find unaccompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal activities.
"A portion of 80% of the parents or members of their family associations are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
By seeking to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, instead of 60 days, in accordance with the staff of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, in order to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the Immigration Court.
Those who are considered unlawful for aid will be deported soon.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in the last few months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are excessive in facilities of greater dimensions than those of Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the ignoring of signs of children's disturbance.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or for the loss of friends adds to the trauma that many are already discussing.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal from US, French and Turkish "occupation forces".
Turning to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualam also requested the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Moulalem, who is also the prime minister, said that foreign forces are found illegally alone in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," said the Assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions more displaced.
It was said that Damascus would continue to "make this sacred battle until we release all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and from "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and counseling Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country destroyed by the war.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions for his return were secure, accusing "some Western countries" of "slaying irrational measures" that led the refugees to remain outside.
"We ask the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are policying what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria while there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security area in the last large rebel ship of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement avoided a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem pointed out that the agreement established "clear steps" and expressed hope that the military action would see the Jews, including the combatants of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "draged".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the country for elections.
Moulalem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "the review of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the prosecution and scandals end their presidency in advance.
In which, of course, it would constitute "the most dramatic finality of a permanent presidency"!
At the moment, there's no sign of the showers' fatigue.
Since 2014, audiences in nobular time more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in November, a rise to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC led the show with up to 3.5 million spectators on big news nights.
"This is a strong chamariz for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC program "Designed Survivor", about a head of the office who becomes President after an attack that destroyed the capital.
In Savoll, a comedian comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
Remember once he called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," he told me.
The chaos has a value of entertainment.
Of course, contrary to television programs, the stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to the family meeting of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Switching from program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can give.
However, it is more than a informed citizen when we are attending a six-hour expert debate on the use of "deep knowledge" sources by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", the heart bluening of $15,000 of Paul Manafort" ("a piece of fashionful insulation", as Washington Post referred to by Stormy Daniels's... hum... Anatomy by President Trump.
For my part, I will never again face Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he's done seems to be a reality show because he gives us something all night," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on the dynamic list of Trump and the daily rounds of the network (attach to NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th in the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, I saw the MSNBC while writing CNN.
He did not break off television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness before the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court in play.
"I still remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said: this is the principle of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but finally they were right."

Substantive external funding in the intercalar elections for the Chamber of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th century of Pennsylvania is known as a funding stream, thanks to the construction of the electoral circles that left two titlers on the race at the same place.
The recent adjustment of the Pittsburgh suburban circles placed the Conor Lamb democracy in the race, which won its place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is candidate against another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely supplanted in the new 17th century.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had decided in January that the ancient circles had inconstitutional favoured the Republicans.
The 17th cycle launched a strong debate on the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangental victory in the extremely disputed March exceptional elections for the 18th electoral cycle of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
The United States attempted to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, subsequently returned to China
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Pequim, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the direction.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of the North American diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "relevant decisions to abandon Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a representative of the Department of State, in a communiqué this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador were considered, which received about $140 million in 2017, including for the control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely punished this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
Following the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America attended a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent the entry of immigrants into the United States.
But by mid-September, the top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, on the whole, and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has organized an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration assigns to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The voice from the White House to Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three North American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on the internal deliberations on the cover of the anonymous.
Their reports were reinforced by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymous.
Study History
The next bomb to be launched may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be conducting his investigation in order to find out whether the Trump campaign was designed with Russia to attack the elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump will face the responsibility of that body at the same time as it is prepared to present itself again to the voters and perhaps to be judged by its parents.
There are many assumptions and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's absence is inevitable - not even his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officials were ready to deport Hitler in a state strike, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The course of History revolves around points of influence like this, in which the inexhaustible course of democracy is accelerated or worked.
The North Americans are currently facing several of these inflation points.
What will we do if Trump dissembles the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly writing to the President, speculating about his inability to perform the task.
Rosenstein says The Times news is wrong.
"How will we respond if the recent requested FBI investigation about Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual abuse and disseminating witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the intercalar elections for a Congress responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we smile at these tests, democracy will soon cross a long desert.
But I believe we're not going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to set up Sabbeth's bicycles on that table with sustics.
With a legacy of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimistic Rangers before the game with the speed of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Viena Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive hit in Spain with the Villarreal in early the month, will leave them in good position to qualify in Group G of the European Union.
An injury in the joel prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the two goals with the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampolim for higher flights.
"It was a good score for us because Villarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old player.
"We found the game with a positive mentality and won a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but, in a global way, the empathe was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part, but we gave it back and dominated it in the second part.
Thursday will be a big European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good outcome in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure that we will give our best to achieve a positive outcome.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the trains are running well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past time and reach success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this holiday-reform account
Despite the fact that participants in the survey have a clear idea of the kind of care they intend to take, few people have talked to their relatives about the matter.
Nearly half of the individuals interviewed in the Nationalwide study referred to talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Just 10% mentioned talking to the children on the same subject.
"People want a family to take care of themselves, but they are not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Framework.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of them if you do not have to know their wishes with due advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Includes your financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your continued care funding options may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybridized policy with monetary valuation to help cover these costs or funding by using its own savings, since it has available these values.
Prepare the legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care provider, choosing a person of your trust to monitor your health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes will be prevented from communicating with them.
Consider also the establishment of a search for its funding.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly progenitor suffers from a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Includes this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"There are not only financial issues in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Man raised several times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was awakened several times with an air pressure on returning home after a night in the city.
The victim, in the house of 40 years, was found in the area of Oxford Grove, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in the chest, in the abdominal and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred around the 02:30 BST, as a "allerious act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve a risk of life and the police asked for witnesses.
Sissumi and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong sysmism and tsunami that reached the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, referred to the authorities, hoping that the number of deaths could increase.
With the broken communications, the sub-pricists were unable to obtain any information from the Dongrya region, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude symposia 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dodhria, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the sysmism and tsunami took place.
Dondrea is a region that extends more than 300 km from the coast, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status below a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dodhea.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morouli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dodhria have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dodrya.
A tsunami also reached the western part of Dongrya in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Sysmic Fire Channel, being regularly reached by sysmos.
Here's some of the main sympathies and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong sysmism on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, resulted in a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong sismos reached the west coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nile Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 symmetry reached the south of Java, the most popular island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude symmetry reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude symmetry reached one of the islands of Mentawai, along Sumatra, depleting a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep symme reached the region of Pidie Jaya, in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among the people who remembered the destruction caused by the deadly sysmos and tsunamis of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the walls of the buildings.
2018: Great Sismos reached the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The six destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of temporaryly isolated tourists.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin held on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-president Sarah Palin, was detained on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was detained by suspects of domestic violence, interference in an investigation on domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to accuse the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in the pre-trial detention centre of Mat-Su, subject to a $500 loan, informed KTUU.
He was present to the judge on the Sabbath, declaring himself 'of course innocent', reported the station.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a fine of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B crime, punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of adding his father, Todd Palin.
Mom, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is to be judged by the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the prosecution of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
Your boyfriend accused him of getting out of the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by Veterans associations after associating his child’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress due to his service in Iraq.

The Sisim reached the Sulawesi Central region, northeastern Indonesia capital, Jacarta.
They circle videos on social networks by showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people met for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Ministry of Public Affairs demands rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
The Ministry of Public Affairs of New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to execute an attack in October, in a cycle in the West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Valley, surrounding peas and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and infected "intendedly" serious injuries, in accordance with the notification that calls for the death penalty, recorded in the South-South area of New York.
Both charges may be punished with the death penalty in accordance with the judicial document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder to the service of organized crime, usually used by the Ministry of Public Affairs in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required a "considerable planning and premeditation", said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov executed it as "atroz, cruel and wrongful".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco", says the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, New York's South Zone did not ask for the death penalty for a charge.
The King, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but the sentence was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit spying acts in favour of the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, the natural person of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate any delays in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt compelled to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hold the ISIS flag in the hospital's room, referring to the police.
It was declared innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defence attorneys, said they were obviously disappointed with the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a conviction of guilt for eternal imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously asked the accused not to ask for the death penalty.
Mr Conservative said that NIGEL FARGE should lead Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today "moving the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians should "sustain pressure" from the Eurosects, while one of the Members of Theresa May suggested that it should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Conservative Peter Bone stated in the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would "have left" if Farage was Brexit's Minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile its deeply divided rivals was highlighted by the conservatives who defend the sustainability, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has discussed maintaining its commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, facing attacks by the Brexit Party, the Permanent Defence Forces and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, encouraging the Euro-Cecilians and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the Caos.
Mr. Bone said at the beginning of the Leive Means Leave in Solihull that he claimed to "end with the Plan".
He suggested that Farage should have been entrusted with responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would've already gone out," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we should finish with the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Good rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed ideas and intends to stay is completely out of reach."
The defending conservator of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, saying to journalists: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is impulsible with the public, the opposition will not approve of it, it is impulsible in our own party and with the militias who take the campaigns to the street and who we owe our election.
Let the Chequers Plan fall and begin to hear."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he added: "Only the first ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "send pressure" if they are willing to take the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of confidence between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to bring Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to get out of it."
Addressing the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to pressure our political class, which is at the edge of bringing Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, proud and ruling United Kingdom."
However, the defenders went to Birmingham before organizing a two-hour start in the city center.
A crowd of activists imposed charges with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The representative of the Labourers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with the application of the party at the opening of the convention.
"These are the people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the wireless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren planned to "seriously put" the potential candidate to the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "seriously apply to the President" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, was re-elected in November against the Republican Member Geoff Diehl, co-ordinator of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been estimated that it will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a debate since the taking of Trump's possession.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to apply to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to correct our government's problems and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest under the murder of Wade Sims, of LSU Tigers
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of the LSU Tigers basketball player, Wade Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, aged 20, was kidnapped near the campus of Southern University in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot on his head, following which he ended up lying," said the police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to the 247sports.
Wade defended a friend and was raised by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted his presence in the area, imputing a weapon, recognizing that he had raised Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police force.
Sims, a Junior of 1.98 meters created in Baton Rouge, argued 32 games and was titled 10 times in the past time, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoverys per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team's orders in Mercedes played a central role in the race.
Out of the field position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind to defend his position in the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the final traffic of the ball, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes a little later and went back to Vettel, but Hamilton passed it after a renegade scarming, after which Ferrari's pilot left the inner part of the free track, at risk of unqualification after a double correction of the trajectory to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen came out of the last line of the grid and was at the seventh place at the end of the first time, on the day of his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race, switching very late of pneus, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, trying to cross Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He had just come to the boxes 44th time but couldn't improve his pace in the last eight times, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in the room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real knight, letting me pass it.
The team did an extraordinary job, which allowed us to finish the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Lesser body language
President Donald Trump reticulated Senator Diane Feinstein at the beginning of the week because of his insistentness that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse.
Speaking at the beginning of the West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission, noting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last days, see the anger, see how people are more, malicious and false," said Trump.
"When we see the fugitives of information and communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, is she running away from you?
You remember her answer... did you open the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, let's wait there.
The run away from us... no, we weren't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but he vowed that the fugitive had been released from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his rejection did not convince the President, who commented during the beginning of the Saturday night: "You know that more, this was a terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the term for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in their favour.
"They are determined to regain power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, malaria, no interest in those who can reach, who have to take the power and control," said the President, according to the Mediaite.

Aerial air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from symbiosis
An Indonesian air controller has been charged as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely off.
More than 800 people died and many continued to disappear after a strong sysmosis had reached the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The region continues to be absorbed, leaving many residents buried in the caves in the city of Palu.
But although his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his position while the control tower had abandoned violence at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused on ensuring that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, then located on the track, was safe.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, in front of the sudden collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, announced the Australian television chain ABC News.
We sent a Balikipan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, you spoke this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated by this news," he added.
However, the authorities believe that the number of deaths can reach the thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Dothria, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the shoulders that we have not yet been able to rescue," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and maintenance to the local area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute there are seizures with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The mini-marketers are being shot all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, who is responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Red Cross Indonesia is on a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he went to the local military forces and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was reached by six people who took over 550 lives.
Air Niugini reported now that there was a man missing after the plane crash in the lake.
The air carrier responsible for the aircraft that was deployed in a lake in Micronesia, Pacific, reports now that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane to land.
In a communication, Air Niugini stated that he could not confirm the paradise of a male passenger from Saturday to evening.
The company said it was working with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped to save the other passengers and crew after the plane had landed in the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The official entities stated on Saturday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical framework.
It is not yet known what caused the loss or the exact sequence of the events.
The U.S. Air Company and the Navy were agreed to claim that the plane could not reach the track and drowned in the lake.
Some witnesses thought the plane was out of track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane came very low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others had been able to draw water by the belt and get to the emergency exits of the plane to land.
He realized that the boarders had entered the panic and started shouting, and that he had suffered a small stroke in his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, mariners who were working in a work of improving a mollusc in the vicinity also helped to rescue the ship to carry people to land before the plane was 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but no one involved Air Niugini.
Analystist explains the chronology of the night's events in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of smoking a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours in expert quality in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to restore the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on the Sabbath and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his car that night, Sanford said he was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
The phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that, shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis disappeared SMS messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' mobile phone.
"He found her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence should begin to present its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.

More black?!
Love of New York marriage process by dispatch through a "racist" SMS message
A love of New York is processing a marriage for discriminatory expulsion after having received an e-mail from the mother to complain that it was "a more black".
The marriage took the charges of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, showed some anxiety when she discovered that the new lover Giselle Maurice was black when she presented for her first day of work in 2016.
"I CAN'T CREER... MORE A PRETA," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to the husband, he sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when it appeared from his pocket, a "scarlet" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman sent Giselle Maurice to complain about the bad performance of the former African-American love and that he was waiting for a Filipino love.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day's work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the marriage and applying for a payment of $350 per day for the period of six months for which she had been elected without contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be punished," said the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The marriage rejected the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they were not able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't really mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had been treated badly?
Is your son born recently?
I don't believe it."
When calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue someone like that?
It's not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the legal process unfolds, the court of the public opinion was keen to condemn marriage on social networks, criticising its conduct and rationality.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's editors received that readers could not identify themselves with a speech exercise.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book had been accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put us in someone's skin that read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to get to know this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small urge to play writing the child book, would not have been disappointed if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had an agridodic taste given its falsification last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," he said that his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to gambling," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a successful son: we were proud even when the fact wasn't ours.
I think it was the way I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington's own."
My daughter was dying and had to leave me on the phone.
Shortly after landing, the daughter was taken suddenly to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors went to save her life.
"No phone calls to say that the situation was very bad and that there were no chances of survival," said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to send me away from her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given you to keep the heart functioning were slowly dropping out of your system and getting out of it.
I've been dead for a while, and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to tell you."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now struggling with the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers on the test for what was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"I always want my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that felt a great deal of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of hunger bring cards on bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have been murdered fight to prevent others from going the same way.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards in a gallery bridge with motivated messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, son of Sharon Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he was killed.
"I don't want no father to hear what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old resident in Lydney, said that the son was a boss of a contaminant smile.
"She was known for her smile.
They all said they were lighting the room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he had been "caught in the darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posters "to know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, or be a friend.
They don't close up on themselves. They have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-term friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after the sudden death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"One day before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
On Christmas, it was a trap. When the boys opened the present, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death betrayed them a lot, but it's something they have to pass over: "Drive a family.
No one's gonna be indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in play with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought, in terms like what I asked - a time-to-time and defined investigation - we could be more united," said Jeff Flake on the Sabbath, fearing that the committee would be "demoroning" facing an angry party attack.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its repugnance is just a temporary matter.
The intermediate elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if the Republicans are expected to have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom she met Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast his resignation vote and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korea deserters decreased during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea decreased from the rise to Kim Jong-un's power seven years ago.
In citing data from the Ministry of the United Kingdom of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared with 2706 of 2011.
Park stated that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that the smugglers of people were demanding more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public statement.
General rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korea's deserts.
Seoul declared that more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them go by China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China believes that the deserters are illegal and non-refugees, and it is often reintroduce them.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The discussions took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a Korean denuclearized peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temporarily inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called history," said Pelosi about her reaction to the witness from Kavanaugh to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally hired all the sexual abuse links to Dr.a Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a declaration of emotional opening, sometimes in a harsh and dissolute voice, talking about his family and years of schooling.
He also explicitly accused the Committee's Democrats, calling for the allegations made against them of "gratis and conspiratoral murder" organized by liberals convicted by Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's witness proves that there are no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court because of his preconceived attitude against the Democrats.
"I think that he was disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
When he was asked if he would try to defend the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won most of the Chamber of Representatives, Pelosi was shocked.
"What I can say is that lying to Congress or the FBI does not gather the conditions for being in the Supreme Court, nor even for serving in its current court," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge in the Court of the Circumscription of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he received powerful views from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (mostly known by Obamacare) or the case of Roe vs Wade, given the fame of being a conservative judge.
During the hearings of confirmation, Kavanaugh asked questions about the possibility of revoking certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose a historical and preconceived person for the Supreme Court and to wait for us to be happy with the decision," said Pelosi.
Women need to know how to control emotions.
It's a justified diaphragm, months and years of furry crossing, and it can't be dissipated without crying.
"We love it when we're hungry," said Mr. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive job in a company who helped me so much. She told me that she also cried when she became pregnant, but she had created a technique. When she became pregnant and began to cry, she said to the person I was talking to, "I don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm tired."
And he went on.
And I thought for myself... it's brilliant." continued Mr. Steinem.
The tears are accepted when expressing anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly that, in an old employment in a office dominated by men in which there was an unexpressable rage, being held in by the neck by an older woman--a friendly manager who terrorized me a little--and literally dragged to the steps to hear say
"You never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy that they're able to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, on the day of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked with Gary Hart in his election to the presidentials.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extra-conjugal relationship on board a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the candidate, an extremely frustrated Patrice Schroeder did not see why she could not apply for herself to the presidentials.
"It wasn't a very weighted decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called on the situation of "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fund-raising was almost as desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he could reach $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He found out that some of his sympathy only gave him $250, although they had given him $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not go into a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - thanks to the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fund-raising and makes the message reach the voters, instead of delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Even he seemed depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder when talking about the media's reaction.
"I would have thought Kleneex was my business sponsor.
What were they going to write in my epitaph now?
"She's sick?"
How the US and China trade war can be beneficial for Pequim
The first rescue of the U.S. and China's trade war was overwhelming, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of the experts, the departure of the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing for a long time.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when important Chinese imports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium, were taxed.
This week was marked by a significant increase in the situation with the new rates to affect goods at $200 billion (150 billion), taxing half of all goods sent by China to the United States.
Pequim has always quoted in the same currency, recently raising rates of 5 to 10 per cent for North American goods at $60 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will empty in the coming days.
Making Washington withdrawing would mean subjugating the demands, but showing public service to the U.S. would be too burdensome for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Pequim makes good use of its trunks, the pressures imposed by the U.S. trade war can sustain China positively for a long time by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that an interim political decision of Washington or Beijing can result in a economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher devoted to Asia's study at the Center for New American Security, a group of reflection.
Minister for Foreign Affairs says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country destroyed for more than seven years of war.
In his speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulalem said that the conditions of the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from countries since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who remained in the country needed humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would receive good support for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, it stated that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the revolution.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe defeats the US and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats in Europe alone since they won Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is going back to being victorious after the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost all the tournaments, took the water-breaking tea on the 16rd floor by giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the most classified player of the European Selection, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The most well-classed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England in which he may have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I can't tell.
It was a difficult year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy for having won the battle.
It was all a team effort and I am happy that I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the North American golfer, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grow up to see him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Involving statistical values of one of the biggest players of all time with 14 great winning titles and just hit by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed by coming to the fairway.
The North American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the devastating performance of his team. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we were able to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My blessings to Thomas.
It's a big captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to continue our work.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat to another team.
They were better."
